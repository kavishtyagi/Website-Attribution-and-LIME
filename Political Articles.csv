100001,1001,NRA strangely silent over Donald Trump's gun-grabbing policy,http://www.dailykos.com/stories/2016/9/23/1573380/-NRA-strangely-silent-over-Donald-Trump-s-gun-grabbing-policy#read-more,1,"Wait. What’s that noise? It’s nothing, that’s what it is. Dead silence.

It’s the sound of the NRA reacting to Trump's promise to pry guns out of American hands.

“If they see a person possibly with a gun or they think may have a gun, they will see the person and they’ll look and they’ll take the gun away,” Trump said Thursday on Fox News, laying out his vision of how the practice works. “They’ll stop, they’ll frisk, and they’ll take the gun away and they won’t have anything to shoot with.”
That’s Donald Trump explicitly saying that he’s going to order cops to grab guns. So you’d think that, perhaps, it would elicit a bit of response from the nation’s most hyper, over-the-top organization on the topic of open and concealed carry. Let’s listen again …

Nope. Not a word.

But spokespersons for the National Rifle Association, (which has endorsed Trump for president), the National Association for Gun Rights and the Second Amendment Foundation did not answer multiple requests for comment in response to Trump’s remarks.
What would the NRA be saying if Hillary Clinton had made these comments? Well, we can look at what they're saying already.

46 days remain until the election. Click here to make sure you're registered to vote. And while you're at it, make sure your family and friends are registered too.

A new ad released today by the National Rifle Association plays just like a 30-second horror movie.

An attractive woman, home alone and asleep in her second-floor bedroom, wakes with a gasp to the sound of breaking glass. As an intruder lurks in the shadows of the ground floor of the home, our protagonist bounds out of bed to grab her phone while simultaneously entering the combination on a nearby gun safe. An announcer explains what we're seeing: ""She'll call 911. Average response time: 11 minutes. Too late. She keeps a firearm in this safe for protection. But Hillary Clinton could take away her right to self-defense."" Like magic, the gun safe suddenly disappears. ""And with Supreme Court justices,"" the announcer continues, ""Hillary can. Don't let Hillary leave you protected with nothing but a phone.""
Of course, Hillary Clinton has never threatened to take away the right to self defense. 

Hillary Clinton does not want to outlaw handguns like the one seen in this ad. She is not against the use of handguns, like the one in this ad, for purposes of self-defense. Hillary Clinton's gun policy does not involve seizing handguns, like the one in this ad, from normal American citizens.

The NRA knows this. The NRA does not want you to know this. The NRA is lying to you.
On the other hand, what is Donald Trump’s announced policy? Taking away handguns. Of course, it could be that the NRA understands that what Trump means is taking away handguns from black people.

Expect the NRA commercial any day now. Just … any day."
100002,1001,Hillary Clinton's debate task: Get Trump to be Trump. Trump's task: Be someone else.,http://www.dailykos.com/stories/2016/9/23/1573409/-Hillary-Clinton-s-debate-task-Get-Trump-to-be-Trump-Trump-s-task-Be-someone-else#read-more,1,"Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump are preparing for their first debate Monday night, and, unsurprisingly, Clinton and Trump’s advisers have opposite goals: Clinton wants a large audience of voters to see Trump as he usually is, and Trump’s advisers want him to be a completely different person. To that end, Clinton will try to rattle Trump into being Trump while withstanding whatever barrage of insults he might hurl at her:

She is mentally readying herself for multiple Trumps: the disciplined opponent who sticks to big themes, the no-holds-barred adversary who goes on the offensive, and the snide antagonist who calls her a “loser” to her face. Her advisers are hurling a host of Trumpian assaults and counterattacks at her to test her responses and adjust them as needed.
But of course, being a woman and all, Clinton has to avoid being seen as too pushy or abrasive. And if it isn’t testament to the power of sexism that she has to worry about that even while on stage with Donald Trump, I don’t know what is. As for Trump:

He may not like debate preparations, but he is very competitive and wants to vanquish Mrs. Clinton on Monday night. His team has been emphasizing the best ways to win: Do not pick stupid fights with her or with the moderator; explain yourself rather than get defensive; and deliver the answers you want rather than worrying about directly answering the question.
We won't ask you to give to Hillary Clinton for every time Donald Trump has insulted her. But can you give $5?

46 days remain until the election. Click here to make sure you're registered to vote. And while you're at it, make sure your family and friends are registered too.

So their advice on how to win is “don’t be Donald Trump”?

Some Trump advisers are concerned that he underestimates the difficulty of standing still, talking pointedly and listening sharply for 90 minutes. In the primary debates he often receded into the background, and only jumped into the debate forcefully when he was attacked. Some advisers worry that if Mrs. Clinton surprises him, he will be caught flat-footed.
Eh, presidents don’t need to be able to stand, talk, and listen, right? For his part, Trump claims he’s going to “stay cool.”

""I'm going to be very respectful of her,"" he said. ""I think she deserves that and I'm going to be nice. And if she's respectful of me, that'll be nice.""
It sure will be interesting to watch Trump try to be “very respectful” for 90 minutes of unscripted speaking."
100003,1001,Donald Trump is selling an energy pipe dream,http://www.dailykos.com/stories/2016/9/23/1573433/-Donald-Trump-is-selling-an-energy-pipe-dream#read-more,1,"Donald Trump has made another call to end restrictions on fracking.

Donald Trump promised to lift environmental regulations, open federal lands to oil and gas production and ease permitting for oil pipelines during a speech at a fracking conference in Pittsburgh on Thursday in which he accused Hillary Clinton of wanting to kill the energy industry.

“I am going to lift the restrictions on American energy and allow this wealth to pour into our communities — including right here in Pennsylvania,” Trump told shale industry leaders. “The shale energy revolution will unleash massive wealth for American workers and families.”
But what Trump is selling the voters of Pennsylvania is a pipe dream. Literally. The oil shale boom is over, and there’s no clearer sign than this: In just the last two years, more than 100 oil companies have gone bankrupt.

The total number of North American oil and gas producers to file for bankruptcy since the beginning of 2015 is now at 102. The total secured and unsecured debt for those filings is approximately $67.8 billion.
Why? Not because of regulations. Not because of anything that President Obama, or the EPA, or state governments did to get in their way. Oil and gas companies are failing because there is too much oil and gas.

46 days remain until the election. Click here to make sure you're registered to vote. And while you're at it, make sure your family and friends are registered too.

The evidence of this is visible every time you pull up to the gas pump. The same period where companies have been failing is the period of absolute glut on the market which has kept fuel prices hovering around $2 a gallon. The 102 companies that have filed for bankruptcy so far are only a fraction of those hovering on the edge. And that’s not even counting the hundreds of drilling companies, pipeline companies, and well service companies they’re taking down with them.

The bursting of the fracking bubble comes with a big cost. And it’s not too little fracking that the industry is mad about. Many in the industry are upset that President Obama has allowed too much fracking.

Employment in the energy industry was highly sought after at the height of the boom that pulled prices at the pump down to $2 a gallon. Now, an estimated 350,000 people have been laid off globally. Of these, 99,000 were fired in Texas alone. These are people who, like their bosses, are highly unlikely to be in the mood to give thanks to the President, whose administration has nurtured the fracking that made the shale revolution possible.
None of that means that the industry won’t lurch toward Trump and his promise of no regulations. Of course they will. No regulations is a shiny, shiny bauble, and it’s irresistible to the hundreds of companies that think they only have to “outlast the other guy” to own the market. The trouble is that everyone is making that bet, and not just in the United States. The whole market is engaged in not just a race to the bottom, but a contest to hold their breath until their competitors go away.

However, this is exactly the kind of market that constantly lures in fresh money that thinks Boom 2.0 is just around the corner. The contest is also being nearly infinitely prolonged by bankruptcy judges who are consistently giving energy companies fast and easy passage through Chapter 11 and setting them back on the battlefield freed from nasty debts (and pension obligations).

Trump is not just continuing to sell a dream of more energy jobs by removing regulations, there seem to be few people calling him on it.

Trump said his stance on hydraulic fracturing and coal is at odds with Clinton’s agenda, which he said would devastate the economy with added taxes and regulations. He cited Clinton’s statement earlier this year that she would “put a lot of coal miners and coal companies out of business,” though she was marking a larger point about taking care of workers left behind by the changing economy.
The pretense that Donald Trump can put a single coal miner back on the job is just that—a pretense. It won’t happen. It can’t happen. Because people don’t dig up coal for no reason. It has to be burned to have value, and no one wants to burn it.

At this moment, there are 156 million tons of coal sitting in stockpiles at US power plants. That’s even though coal production in the country is down by 164 million tons in just the last year. Why isn’t there more demand for coal? Look two paragraphs up—gas is incredibly cheap. The fracking boom has decimated the coal industry. Decimated doesn’t even cover it.

Fracking has killed coal. And coal is never coming back. Never ever.

There are really good reasons why coal isn’t coming back even if, right now, today, gas prices doubled. Instead, coal power plants are being converted into gas power plants. That trend is going to continue. No matter what Donald Trump or any other politician does, the demand for coal is going to go down. Continuously down. We could pay people to dig it up and just push it around … but that would be the only way to put more miners back to work.

Because there’s simply nowhere to burn any more coal than we’re already producing. And oil companies are going bust at the same time because market prices for natural gas are so low, they don’t support exploration and drilling for new wells.

Donald Trump can stick that in his pipe … and do whatever he wants with it. But his energy plan is ridiculous."
100004,1002,Hillary Clinton Scrambles to Beat Trump to Riot-Stricken Charlotte,http://www.breitbart.com/2016-presidential-race/2016/09/23/hillary-clinton-scrambles-to-beat-trump-to-riot-stricken-charlotte/,1,"Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton will visit Charlotte, North Carolina on Sunday, after two days of rioting in the city in response to an African-American police officer shooting an armed African-American man who refused to disarm.
The news of the visit was revealed by Clinton aide Nick Merrill, a day after Trump signaled that he was also thinking of visiting the riot stricken city.

“Trump is considering trip to Charlotte next week after Monday’s debate, I’m told,” wrote CNN’s Jim Acosta on Twitter on Thursday. “Officials now looking at logistics for a visit.”

In an interview with Breitbart News Daily on Friday morning, Omarosa Manigault, the director of African-American outreach for Donald Trump’s campaign, signaled he was considering it.

“What he wants to do is to be there for Americans who feel like people have turned their backs on them. And so as long as everything logistically works out, certainly, yes, he will go visit those folks,” she said of Trump’s possible Charlotte visit.

But it appears that Clinton has jumped ahead of Trump’s plans, interrupting four planned days of rest and debate preparations at home. The first presidential debate is scheduled for Monday.

Clinton has not made a public appearance on the campaign trail since Wednesday.

Earlier today Clinton called for Charlotte law enforcement to release the video of the shooting to the public.

“Charlotte should release police video of the Keith Lamont Scott shooting without delay,” she wrote on Twitter. “We must ensure justice & work to bridge divides.”

Earlier in the week, Clinton signaled that she was the right candidate to end the “systemic racism” in the law enforcement community.

“Maybe I can by speaking directly to white people say, ‘Look this is not who we are,’” she said. “We’ve got to do everything possible to improve policing, to go right at implicit bias.”"
100005,1002,Mike Pence: Donald Trump ‘Loves His Family and He Loves This Country’,http://www.breitbart.com/2016-presidential-race/2016/09/23/mike-pence-in-arizona-donald-trump-loves-his-family-and-he-loves-this-country/,1,"Republican Vice Presidential nominee Mike Pence tells congregants at the Living Word Bible Church in Mesa, Arizona about his own family values and those echoed in the Republican Party, while praising Donald Trump for his integrity and character.
“All you need to know about Donald Trump is he loves his family and he loves this country,” Pence told the crowd.

“When Donald Trump talks about that we will make America great again, I have to tell you what he means is that, from the day we arrive in the White House, I promise you the Trump-Pence team is going to work our hearts out every day.” Pence noted that “than a whole lot of zeroes, Donald Trump and I have a lot in common” noting that a major part of that commonality lies in “the passion that we both feel for the American dream.”

Pence also spoke about his Christian faith and reiterated his pro-life stance. “I speak on behalf of my wife and I. [And] I would tell you there is no more important cause to the Pences than the cause of life,” he said. He added that Trump has similarly “made a clear commitment to the sanctity of human life.”

The church event was Pence’s third visit to the Phoenix-area since accepting the Republican vice presidential nomination in July. It was held after an earlier Pence town-hall-style appearance in Colorado Springs, Colorado. The Living World Bible Church, which is located on 3520 E. Brown Road, has approximately 8,000 congregants.

Although Arizona is traditionally a red sate, polls show Hillary Clinton and Trump very close there. The last two Democratic presidential candidates to win the Grand Canyon State in an election were Presidents Bill Clinton in 1996 and Harry Truman in 1948.

Pence also devoted a few minutes of his 25-minute speech to ending illegal immigration, reiterating a key phrase in Trump’s campaign: “We’re going to build a wall, and Mexico is going to pay for it.” Trump recently announced that the wall he intends to commission will be paid for using seized assets from Mexican drug cartels; groups that are fueling the deadly and high-lucrative illegal drug trade which has resulted in a costly war on drugs.

Before taking questions from the audience, Pence thanked the crowd for their prayers and praised Trump’s character and leadership, saying “Character matters to the presidency and Donald Trump will bring the highest level of integrity to the highest office of the land.”"
100006,1002,The Country Can’t Survive a Third Obama Term,http://www.breitbart.com/2016-presidential-race/2016/09/23/the-country-cant-survive-a-third-obama-term/,1,"Supporting Donald Trump is a bitter pill for many conservatives and libertarians to swallow.
But, to the two of us, a Republican and a recently declared independent, it is ultimately the only defensible decision if our votes are to make any difference on November 8.

No one should consider staying home on Election Day.

Voting third party, while attractive on the psychological level and, perhaps, superficially gratifying on a moral level, is a self-indulgent luxury we cannot afford in 2016.

Either Donald Trump or the Clintons will be the next President of the United States. The certainties that come with electing the Clintons overshadow both the known flaws and the uncertainties of a President Trump.

One of us left the Republican Party in 2015, not in protest over Donald Trump’s lack of a credible track record on issues conservatives care about, but over the Republican establishment’s betrayal of the party’s principles, platform and unwillingness to oppose Obama’s unconstitutional power grabs.

The other was a pledged Ted Cruz delegate to the Republican National Convention in Cleveland, who supported the floor walkout over RNC hijinks on convention procedures and rules, and has since expressed serious doubts over Donald Trump’s temperament, history and policy flip-flops.

We still have many of those doubts about both Trump’s fitness and the Republican Party’s commitment to carry out Trump’s promises, especially on border control, Islamic terrorism, and Supreme Court appointments.

Nevertheless, while those doubts and concerns remain, they pale into insignificance when compared to the absolute certainty of the fate that awaits constitutional liberty under the “progressive” rule of Hillary Clinton.

Take the Supreme Court vacancies as an example of the real-world choice we face in November.

Are we 100 percent confident that Donald Trump will appoint true constitutionalist judges to fill court vacancies?  No.  But we are 100% certain that Hillary Clinton will appoint progressive judges who will undermine the 2nd Amendment and other essential freedoms.

Are we 100 percent certain that Donald Trump will build a border fence, enforce our immigration laws and say no to another general amnesty?  No, we can’t be 100 percent certain of that.

But we know that Hillary Clinton will continue and probably even expand Obama’s outrageous dismantling of immigration law enforcement.She says so.

We could list a dozen other important issues where Trump may disappoint us by not following through on his promises, and a few other issues where his policies remain murky at best. But on those issues most important to constitutional conservatives, Donald Trump is significantly more likely to follow a conservative path than Hillary Clinton.

The new “progressive” Democrats have even stopped pretending to respect the Constitution. To them, it’s just an old piece of paper made obsolete by history and multiculturalism.

The Democrat Party of Truman and JFK is dead, replaced by an openly socialist party committed to massive income redistribution and “global citizenship.”

Trump has tapped into the concerns and frustrations of those alienated Republicans and “Blue Dog Democrats” whose parties are now unrecognizable to them.

He has surrounded himself with and listens to other strong voices who, whether they pass the constitutional conservative purity test or not, fully support his never-wavering mantra of America First.

He has imperfectly, but significantly, adapted his behaviors and his rhetoric to his new role as potential future president.

These actions and more, plus the support of a fast-growing number of true movement conservatives, border patrol agents, police fraternities, Tea Party Patriots, military heroes, wildly changing and favorable polling, and the voices that have been pushing us all along–all have made the case for Donald Trump.

And the thought (nightmare) of President Hillary and First (whatever) Bill Clinton seals the deal.

The Republican Party is at a crossroads, and many of the Old Guard and the insiders of the Washington establishment (what Ted Cruz rightfully refers to as the “cartel”), are openly supporting Hillary Clinton.

Why? Because she does not threaten the status quo. Donald Trump does. Well, we say, good riddance, and we pray that Trump really does mean to turn DC on its head!  We know that Hillary will not.

For months now since the Cleveland convention, both of us have been saying about Donald Trump that we will probably hold our nose and vote for him despite our misgivings.

Because of Trump’s contradictory past, many conservatives will be doing that on November 8.

If that is the best you can do, so be it.  But, we have concluded that with so much at stake, a reluctant vote is not enough.

With Donald Trump we at least have a shot at preserving our Constitution. That leads us to stand up and say: Donald Trump, we see that your glass is only half full.

But, to a nation dying on the desert of Political Correctness, that is salvation enough. We would rather spend the next four years fighting a potentially dying Party and an America First President, though both are not well-grounded in our principles, than figuring out how to survive a third Obama term run by the feeble, dishonest, Alinskyite heads of the now-exposed (for those who care to see) Clinton dynasty.

There is a very small space between #NeverHillary and #NeverTrump. It’s called the voting booth. The debates are coming and Election Day is approaching fast.  Let’s fire it up.  Let’s give our nation a fighting chance.

Let’s win with Trump.

100007,1003,Taking A Stand On Social Security: Clinton’s Bold Proposal vs. Trump’s Hidden Agenda,http://www.huffingtonpost.com/nancy-altman/taking-a-stand-on-social_b_12158010.html?utm_hp_ref=politics,1,"AARP has asked all candidates to take a stand on the vital issue of Social Security. In fact, Hillary Clinton and the 2016 Democratic Party Platform have taken a powerful pro-Social Security stand. For that matter, Donald Trump and the Republican Party have taken a Social Security stand, too, though a disturbing one, which they seem to want to keep hidden from view. Their stand, once understood, should concern every Social Security beneficiary now and in the future.

Clinton and the Democrats recognize what most Americans know: Social Security is more important than ever. It is Americans’ most important, and often only, source of retirement income, life insurance, and disability insurance.

She and her fellow Democrats understand that our nation is facing a looming retirement income crisis, where traditional pensions are disappearing and too many Americans fear they will never be able to retire with dignity and independence. They recognize that our Social Security system is the nation’s most efficient, universal, secure, and fair source of retirement income, as well as pre-retirement income in the event of disability or premature death, leaving dependent children.

That is why Clinton and her fellow Democrats are committed to fighting to expand Social Security. It is why Clinton and the Democratic Party oppose all cuts, which would only exacerbate the looming crisis. They understand that expanding Social Security is a solution.

In addition to expanding Social Security’s cash benefits, Clinton and her fellow Democrats are fighting to restore an invaluable Social Security benefit that has been weakened for most Americans and lost altogether for many. That is the benefit of security, peace of mind.

Americans should be confident and secure in the knowledge that, if tragedy should strike in the form of premature death, leaving dependent children, or in the form of a serious disabling illness or accident, which makes work impossible, their incomes will be replaced, thanks to the Social Security benefits they have earned. They should be secure in the knowledge that if they are fortunate to live to old age, Social Security will be there, providing guaranteed and timely benefits, month after month for the remainder of their lives.

Americans used to have confidence in the future of Social Security. In their recently released book Stronger Together, Clinton and her running mate, Tim Kaine, astutely identify the culprit that has stolen the invaluable benefit of security. Clinton and Kaine spotlight the “years of mythmaking claiming we cannot afford Social Security and that the only solution is to cut the benefits on which 90 percent of American seniors rely.”

Clinton and her fellow Democrats know what should be obvious to everyone: As the wealthiest nation in the world at the wealthiest moment in our history, the United States can not only afford our current Social Security system, but an expanded one. The debate over whether to expand or cut Social Security’s modest but vital benefits is a debate about values and what kind of nation we want to leave those who follow. The false claim that Social Security is unaffordable is, as Clinton and Kaine state, a destructive myth.

Rather than having an honest debate over values, however, Donald Trump’s Republican Party continues to spread the destructive myth of unaffordability. Trump and his fellow Republicans state in their 2016 Platform that Social Security’s “current course” [i.e., keeping our promises and paying the Social Security benefits that hard working Americans have earned and deserve] “will lead to a financial and social disaster.”

What thin reed are they relying on to spread this image of disaster? When pension plans, private or public, project far into the future, unanticipated surpluses or deficits sometimes appear. Indeed, Social Security is projecting a modest shortfall, around two decades away. How modest is the shortfall? Very. Social Security is close to fully funded for the next century and beyond! Precisely, according to the latest projections, Social Security is one hundred percent funded for the next ten years, 95 percent funded for the next 25 years, 87 percent funded for the next 50 years, and 84 percent funded for the next three-quarters of a century. These projections are unsurprising, unremarkable, and unalarming. Hardly a cause for panic! Not a reason for the frightening “disaster” language of the Republicans.

Hillary Clinton and her Democrats responsibly and wisely plan to pay for every penny of their proposed expansions while also restoring Social Security to long-range balance by requiring millionaires and billionaires to pay their fair share for Social Security. About a dozen Social Security expansion bills in Congress doing just that - expanding Social Security while restoring the program to balance - have been carefully reviewed and analyzed by the actuaries at the Social Security Administration. The analyses are available for all to review on the Office of the Chief Actuary’s website, at ssa.gov/oact.

Clinton and the Democratic Party recognize that expanding Social Security while requiring the wealthiest to pay more is a solution to income and wealth inequality. 
They are committed to reversing the perilous and immoral rise in income and wealth inequality, where millionaires and billionaires continue to see their vast fortunes grow to unimaginable heights while the vast majority of Americans have seen their income and wealth stagnate or, worse, decline. Expanding benefits and requiring millionaires and billionaires, who have gained so much from our Commonwealth (i.e. common wealth), to pay their fair share for Social Security is not too much to ask. It is an important step in reversing inequality and reducing the squeeze on working families, while putting retirement in closer reach.

So that is where Hillary and the Democratic Party stand: In support of expanding benefits, opposed to making our looming retirement income crisis worse by cutting benefits, and paying for every penny of benefits by requiring millionaires and billionaires to pay their fair share.

What do Donald Trump and his Republican Party propose? In contrast to Hillary Clinton’s and the Democratic Party’s clear stand, Donald Trump’s Republican Party disingenuously pretends to take no stand. The 2016 Republican Platform meekly and unhelpfully, states, “Of the many reforms being proposed, all options should be on the table.” Keep reading, though, and it becomes clear that Donald Trump and his fellow Republicans do take a stand, just one that they want to hide.

The statement about being open to all options is contradicted by another, more honest, though opaque, statement: “As Republicans, we oppose tax increases and believe in the power of markets....” With coded language and process of elimination, Donald Trump’s Republican Party is stating that it desires to cut and privatize our Social Security system. They prefer to shield millionaires and billionaires from an additional penny of tax. Instead, they want to restore Social Security to balance by slashing the hard earned benefits of working Americans, instead. And why refer to the power of markets, except to implicitly express a desire to gamble Social Security’s guaranteed, secure benefits, exposing them to the ups and downs of Wall Street?

It is no wonder that Donald Trump and his fellow Republicans are trying to hide their true position. Cutting and privatizing Social Security are extreme, radical, irresponsible positions, totally out of step with the American people. Poll after poll show the American people overwhelmingly reject their position, and embrace the position of Clinton and her Democratic Party. A recent poll, completed September 16-18, 2016 of swing state voters, is typical of the results: Instead of having the courage to clearly state their honest, though wildly unpopular, convictions, Donald Trump and his Republican colleagues seek to stoke fear. They eagerly and loudly trumpet the supposed “financial and social disaster” they claim Social Security will cause. In sharp contrast, they never talk about the financial and social disaster that already has been caused by Wall Street, a disaster from which so many Americans are still struggling to recover. Instead, Donald Trump and the Republicans seek to shield Wall Street from paying their fair share to Social Security. Indeed, they want to reward that very same Wall Street, allowing them to earn huge fees as they gamble American Workers’ hard earned Social Security.

Voters should not be fooled by candidates who speak of “saving” Social Security. Nor should they be fooled by Donald Trump’s assertions, which he made during the primaries, that he would not cut Social Security. As just discussed, his Party’s Platform reveals the truth. Trump’s own running mate and his closest campaign advisers all are on record for wanting to cut and privatize Social Security.

Revealingly, before Donald Trump started running for President, he was not so concerned about hiding his desire to cut and privatize Social Security. Then, he used a false, derogatory slur, “Ponzi scheme,” to refer to our Social Security system and its earned benefits. He said that “privatization would be good for all of us.” And he called for raising the retirement age to age 70 because, as he remarked, not worrying about hiding from view the elite billionaire that he is, “how many times will you really want to take that trailer to the Grand Canyon?”

Hillary Clinton, and the Democratic Party which created Social Security, will fight to expand benefits while requiring millionaires and billionaires to pay more. Donald Trump and the Republican Party will probably not tell you, but they appear eager to drastically cut, and indeed, dismantle our Social Security system, brick by brick, by handing it over to their Wall Street friends.

Seniors and others who care about Social Security should be keenly aware of this sharp difference when they go to vote on November 8. Their and their family’s economic security will likely rest on the outcome."
100008,1003,One More Time: Why Not Trump?,http://www.huffingtonpost.com/dr-ichak-kalderon-adizes-/one-more-time-why-not-tru_b_12110104.html?utm_hp_ref=politics,1,"Let me make it clear, I am not enamored with Clinton either. Unfortunately, we have two bad options. We have to choose which of them is less dangerous to this wonderful country. I think Trump is more dangerous, and in what follows I will explain why.

According to my (PAEI) classification of leadership styles,(1) he is an enormous (E). Here are the symptoms:

He does not follow a script very well.

He listens to no one unless they are applauding him. As a big ego, he likes to surround himself with people who admire him and clap their hands for his performance. He behaves like an actor on stage. He enjoys tremendously the attention he gets. He loves the limelight and the hordes of people cheering him on, and he abhors anyone who disagrees with him.

Like all big (E)s, he exaggerates to the point of being untruthful.

He does not explain his policies. “Details aren’t important now,” he says. If he can’t explain the details now, I doubt he ever will. How will he build a wall on the Mexican border? He says he will make Mexico pay for it. We all know Mexico thinks this is a joke. They won’t pay for such a wall. But he continues to insist they will, without giving any explanation of how he will he accomplish that. He says he will expel millions of illegal immigrants. How? No idea.

He does not read in preparation for decision making. He relies on rumors to make up his mind. He even says, “It is not good to know too much.” He believes that a vague overview of a problem is enough information for him to decide what to do.

Many people who support him believe his decisions will be ok because he will surround himself with qualified people who will not let him make big mistakes.
But If I am right that he is a big , big (E) he does not listen to anyone. Especially if they disagree with him. 
Like a classic (E) he believes he is surrounded by turkeys. He believes he is the eagle who knows best. That is why he says, “I know better than the generals how and when to handle war.”

He has a low coefficient of error, like all (E)s. He behaves like an eagle, to whom as any bird, change looks very simple, effortless, flying over a mountain, ignoring the details of the terrain that would make the same route extremely difficult on the ground. That is why he says he will destroy the so-called Islamic State in thirty days. That is why a group of top thirty security experts who know the complexity of the situation signed a petition saying that he is dangerous to the security of the United States.

Like all (E)s, he is brash and confident. He promises that he can do all that needs to be done, and that he is the change this country needs.

But is (E) leadership what the country needs now? I believe the United States is in the aging part of its lifecycle. The (A) is enormous. The bureaucracy and the centralization of decision making powers in Washington are only two of the symptoms of aging. That is the reason why the population wants to see change. This explains to me why Trump, the big (E), has gotten as far as he has in the campaign and why he is so close to the White House.

But exclusive (E) style , put on top of an enormous (A) system, is dangerous. He is going to be reckless. He will skirt the law. He will violate the Constitution; I am sure of that. A big (E) like this in charge of a big (A) system will be destroying the (A), which people may like to see, but it will have disastrous side effects if not done correctly. Dismantling a bureaucracy and decentralizing power that accumulated in Washington needs to be done very carefully like one will disarm a mine. Destroying a system is not equivalent to building a new one. I have no doubt there will be a crisis America has not seen yet. The president has authority through executive action to make decisions and bypass the legislative function. Trump will do exactly that and lead us into a constitutional crisis. He is an arsonist in his style; he will start fires all over the place, fires that he will not be able to control. These will not be small fires, as he will have enormous power. This is serious. America is not some startup country where the (E) style is effective.

Clinton is less dangerous. She is being accused of lying. Her lies are minuscule in comparison to Trumps exaggerations which are continuously proven to hold no water i.e. they are lies too. And much, much bigger.

She is being accused of supporting the war in Iraq, for Bengazi, for losses on the foreign policy arena as if she could have controlled those events all by herself. Much of what she is being accused of I attribute to the fact the sun is setting on America and she could not have done much to stop that.

The email saga? Well, Powel did it and even recommended the practice. It is all a smear strategy of dirty politics.

Granted, she is not JFK. She is not FDR. She is not another Clinton we all know. I would have preferred someone with more charisma, with more courage to make changes and try at least to de-bureaucratize this country but in comparing the risks we will be taking with Trump’s hands on the levers of power versus her hands, she is prone to do much less damage.

Very concerned of what is happening to America,

100009,1003,What To Read On Trump(ism),http://www.huffingtonpost.com/cas-mudde/what-to-read-on-trumpism_b_12154604.html?utm_hp_ref=politics,1,"I recently criticized US political science for being blind of the right eye, arguing that scholars of American politics have been ill-prepared for three of the main political developments in American politics this century: the role of neoconservatives in the George W. Bush administration, the rise of the Tea Party, and the current success of Donald Trump. I argued that the reasons for this blond spot are of a structural nature, affecting the study of American politics even more than other parts of the discipline.

I ended the post with a promise to provide a list of the limited scholarship that could help provide a better understanding of the rise of Donald Trump and Trumpism, i.e. his unique form of radical right politics. I don’t claim to include all relevant resources; most notably, I focus exclusively on books (referencing the original and most recent and updated version). Few of these studies have been written by political scientists, let alone by mainstream political scientists, but perhaps the phenomenal public attention paid to Trump will change that.

As I have argued in several other posts, nativism and radical right politics have a long history in the United States. The classic study to understand the long tradition of American nativism is historian John Higham’s seminal Strangers in the Land: Patterns of American Nativism, 1860-1925 (1955/2002), which covers the period of the Know Nothings to the second coming of the Ku Klux Klan. The classic study of the postwar radical right is sociologist Daniel Bell’s edited volume The Radical Right: The New American Right (1963/2001), which focuses particularly on the anti-communist radical right of the 1950s, which the progressive historian Richard Hofstadter famously referred to as “the paranoid style in American politics.”

There are three books that focus on the whole period of the mid-19th century to the late-20th century. Sociologists Seymour Martin Lipset and Earl Raab’s The Politics of Unreason: Right Wing Extremism in America, 1790-1977 (1970/1978), discusses the US radical right on the basis of a sociological theory of status politics and working class authoritarianism that is still highly current today. Historian David H. Bennett’s The Party of Fear: The American Far Right from Nativism to the Militia (1988/1995) is more a “narrative history,” which puts individual groups and movements within their specific historical context. In Right-Wing Populism in America: Too Close for Comfort (2000) political activists Chip Berlet and Matthew N. Lyons, finally, provide the most comprehensive and detailed overview of the US radical right through the conceptual lens of populism and producerism, tying it somewhat to the much more developed literature on the European radical right.

But to understand the rise of Trump and Trumpism we should not only look at the (often fringe) radical right, or what the media have come to misguidedly call “alt right” in recent times, but also on the transformation of the two-party system in general, and the Republican Party in particular. In From the New Deal to the New Right: Race and the Southern Origins of Modern Conservatism (2009) University of Oregon political scientist Joe Lowndes analyzes the conscious strategy within the Grand Old Party (GOP) to use “race” to force a re-alignment in the South, where nativist and racist voters had traditionally supported the so-called Dixiecrats. In many ways the Trump campaign can be seen as the extremist swan song of the Southern Strategy of the GOP. The bestseller It’s Even Worse Than It Looks: How the American Constitutional System Collided With the New Politics of Extremism Thomas Mann and Norman Ornstein, provides a useful complementary perspective to Lowndes study, focusing more specifically on the radicalization of the GOP in Congress, clearly showing that the GOP was not “hijacked” by Trump, it created Trump!

Surprisingly, the rise of the Tea Party, just a few years ago, features little in the current debate on Trump. And yet, as the few insightful studies of the Tea Party show, the both phenomena play on very similar attitudes and frustrations. In the most empirical account, Change They Can’t Believe In: The Tea Party and Reactionary Politics in America (2013), political scientists Christopher S. Parker (University of Washington) and Matt A. Barreto (UCLA) hark back to the theories of the 1960s and 1970s (e.g. Bell and Lipset) as they interpret the Tea Party primarily as a reactionary response to recent changes in American society, most notably related to majority-minority relations. Harvard University political scientists Theda Skocpol and Vanessa Williamson take a different approach in their The Tea Party: The Remaking of Republican Conservatism (2013), emphasizing the internal struggles within Republican conservatism and the role of the conservative media (notably Fox News). Finally, Steep: The Precipitous Rise of the Tea Party (2012) is a highly original volume edited by Lawrence Rosenthal and Christine Trost, who direct the Center for Right-Wing Studies at the University of California at Berkeley, as far as I know the only research center in the US specifically devoted to right-wing politics (full disclosure: I am affiliated with the Center). Steep is of particular value because it includes scholars from various disciplines adopting different, and sometimes opposing, theoretical perspectives on the character and explanations of the Tea Party.

But the Tea Party is not the only conservative uprising against the Republicans In Name Only (RINO). In a fascinating new book, Right-Wing Critics of American Conservatism, University of Alabama political scientist George Hawley presents an overview of the heterogeneous fauna of right-wing groups and individuals that exist in the shadows of the GOP, from libertarians to white supremacists. In his book Terrified: How Anti-Muslim Fringe Organizations Became Mainstream (2016) Duke University sociologist Christopher A. Bail focuses on a specific subculture that has been instrumental in bridging the mainstream right and the radical right in the US. The importance of Islamophobia to the 2016 presidential campaign of Trump, as well as some other candidates (like Ted Cruz), is difficult to overstate.

Finally, while there are several specific American aspects to the character and rise of Trump and Trumps, they are part of a broader rise in radical right politics in western democracies, most notably in Western Europe. And while the radical right is a fairly marginal topic of study in American politics, it is among the most studied topics in European politics. My own Populist Radical Right Parties in Europe (2007) provides a critical “state of the art” overview of the rich scholarship on radical right parties in Europe, while Revolt on the Right: Explaining for the Radical Right in Britain (2013), by British political scientists Robert Ford and Matthew Goodwin, is an accessible and concise application of the European literature to the British case, specifically the United Kingdom Independence Party (UKIP), perhaps the most familiar to American readers.

This list is not meant to be exhaustive and will undoubtedly miss some other useful resources. If anyone knows additional books that provide solid analysis, rather than political advocacy, on the radical right in the US, please suggest them in the comments."
100010,1004,"Trump: Blacks In Worst Shape Ever; Obama: Uh, That Whole Slavery Thing?",http://talkingpointsmemo.com/livewire/obama-trump-blacks-worst-shape-ever,1,"In an interview aired on Friday on ABC News, President Obama called out Donald Trump's claim earlier this week that the black community is in its worst shape ""ever, ever, ever.""

""I think even most 8-year-olds will tell you that whole slavery thing wasn't very good for black people. Jim Crow wasn't very good for black people,"" Obama told ABC.

""It's unrealistic to think that somehow that all just completely went away, because the Civil Rights Act was passed or because Oprah's making a lot of money or because I was elected president,"" he continued. ""You know, that's not how society works. And if you have hundreds of years of racial discrimination it's likely that the vestiges of that discrimination linger on. And we should acknowledge that and own that.""

The President also addressed the violent protests in Charlotte, North Carolina, over the fatal police shooting of Keith Lamont Scott.

Obama said that over the past few years, most people concerned about the relationship between the police and the black community have been ""doing it the right way.""

""Every once in a while you see folks doing it the wrong way. Looting, breaking glass, those things are not going to advance the cause,"" he said.

Obama hopes that ""people in the community pull together and say, ‘How do we do this the right way?’”"
100011,1004,Trump: Clinton Has Given 'A Nod' To 'Narrative Of Cops As A Racist Force',http://talkingpointsmemo.com/livewire/trump-clinton-narrative-police-racist,1,"During a campaign rally in Aston, Pennsylvania, on Thursday, Donald Trump dismissed the ""narrative of cops as a racist force"" and said that those who push that narrative, including Hillary Clinton, contribute to unrest following fatal police shootings.

""Those peddling the narrative of cops as a racist force in our society — and this is a narrative that is supported with a nod by my opponent, you see what she’s saying, and it’s not good — share responsibly and the unrest that is afflicting our country and hurting those who have really the very least,"" Trump said, according to the Washington Post.

Trump's comment followed two nights of violent protests in Charlotte, North Carolina, over the fatal police shooting of a black man, though Trump never mentioned Charlotte by name, according to NBC News.

The Republican nominee said that ""the problem is not that there are too many police. The problem is that there are not enough police,"" according to NBC.

He criticized Clinton and accused her of not caring about those living in poverty in the U.S.

""Hillary Clinton does not have to worry about the sirens and the gunshots. She doesn’t worry about it. She’s sleeping, she’s sleeping,” Trump said, according to the Washington Post. “No, it’s the poor family living in the inner city, it’s the poor mother who feels like a refugee in her own country. Hillary Clinton doesn’t want to hear their voices, so I will be their voice."""
100012,1004,Clinton To Visit Charlotte On Sunday,http://talkingpointsmemo.com/livewire/clinton-visit-charlotte-keith-scott,1,"Hillary Clinton's campaign confirmed Friday that she will travel to Charlotte, North Carolina on Sunday, according to the Wall Street Journal.

The city has been the site of intense protests following the police killing of Keith Lamont Scott on Tuesday afternoon.

After Scott's wife, Rakeyia Scott, released video of the police shooting that she had taken on her cell phone to NBC News and the New York Times on Friday, Clinton called on the Charlotte Police Department to release body cam and dash cam video of the incident ""without delay.""

Throughout the week, Clinton has commented on the shooting that led to Scott's death, and on another officer-involved shooting in Tulsa, Oklahoma, calling the events ""unbearable"" and ""intolerable.""

On Wednesday night, Justin Carr was shot while attending the protests in Charlotte. He died of his injuries on Thursday, and Rayquan Borum was arrested Friday morning in connection with the murder."
100013,1005,Intelligence Officials Are Looking Into a Trump Adviser's Possible Kremlin Ties,http://www.motherjones.com/politics/2016/09/trump-aide-carter-page-under-investigation-kremlin-ties,1,"US intelligence officials are looking into the Kremlin ties of a US businessman who is serving as a foreign policy adviser to Republican nominee Donald Trump, Yahoo News reported today. During briefings given to senior members of Congress about the possibility that the Russian government is trying to tamper with the presidential election, intelligence officials have discussed Trump adviser Carter Page, who runs an energy investment firm that specializes in Russia and Europe, according to the site.

Yahoo reports that members of Congress were told that Page may have had contact or set up meetings with high-level Kremlin officials and may have discussed the possibility of the United States lifting sanctions on Russia if Trump becomes president. An unnamed senior law enforcement official confirmed to Yahoo, ""It's being looked at.""

Trump told the Washington Post in March that Page, a former Merrill Lynch investment banker, was part of his foreign policy team. Page's role in the campaign has been described in various ways since, including as an informal adviser.

Page has a long history with Russia, and he is known for expressing sympathy for Russian President Vladimir Putin. Earlier this year, Page told Bloomberg News that he had lived in Moscow in the early 2000s for several years when he worked for Merrill Lynch, working closely with the state-owned Russian oil and gas company Gazprom. After leaving Merrill Lynch, Page started his own investment firm, and this firm has invested in Gazprom, which has been included on the list of Russian firms targeted for sanctions by the United States due to its close links to Putin. Page has been consistently critical of Western attempts to sanction Russian companies and officials over Putin's incursions into Ukraine.

In July, Page raised eyebrows by traveling to Russia to speak at an event for an organization with links to Putin's inner circle, where he took issue with US policy, declaring that Western countries ""criticized these regions for continuing methods which were prevalent during the Cold War period...Yet ironically, Washington and other Western capitals have impeded potential progress through their often hypocritical focus on ideas such as democratization, inequality, corruption, and regime change.""

A Trump campaign spokesman told Yahoo that Page has no role in the campaign but did not respond when asked why the campaign had earlier called Page an adviser."
100014,1005,Trump Ohio Deputy's Racial Remarks Reveal a Hidden Reason for His Rust Belt Success,http://www.motherjones.com/politics/2016/09/donald-trumps-appeal-ohios-rust-belt-isnt-just-about-economy,1,"People across America reacted with shock Thursday to a video of racially charged comments by Donald Trump's campaign chairwoman for Ohio's Mahoning County, who denied that racism existed there before Barack Obama became president—remarks that quickly led her to resign. But one group was probably less surprised to hear this kind of racially divisive language: the black residents of Mahoning County.

Mahoning County, in the heart of the Rust Belt, has received outsize attention this year for the exodus of once-loyal blue-collar Democratic voters into the Trump camp. The overwhelming focus of this attention has been economic: In this poster child of industrial decline, the prevailing narrative goes, residents opposed to free trade have flocked to Trump and his promise to restore the Rust Belt to better times. But the comments by Kathy Miller, Trump's Mahoning chairwoman, reveal a different story that African American residents have been telling all along—one of political shifts driven by issues of race and racism.

""I don't think there was any racism until Obama got elected,"" Miller, a real estate agent, told the Guardian recently a video-taped interview posted Thursday. ""Now, you know, with the people with the guns and shooting up neighborhoods and not being responsible citizens, that's a big change, and I think that's the philosophy that Obama has perpetuated on America.""

Miller continued, to the wide-eyed astonishment of the reporter, ""And if you're black and you haven't been successful in the last 50 years, it's your own fault. You've had every opportunity, it was given to you.""

Mahoning County is ground zero for Trump's rise. It's the home of Youngstown, famous for its decline from a booming steel town in the first half of the 20th century to a downtrodden playground for the mob in the second half. Now Youngstown is a struggling, down-and-out city where signs of rehabilitation are dwarfed by the lingering effects of the economic collapse and the poverty of many of the city's black residents. Following white flight to the suburbs, Youngstown is nearly half black. Thanks to the strong influence of labor unions, for decades the region has been a Democratic stronghold. But in the Ohio Republican primary in March, Trump won the region handily, with the help of many Democratic voters who switched parties to support Trump.

For black Youngstown residents, Miller's comments reflect what they've long said: that Trump's popularity there has a lot to do with race.
I visited Youngstown in June. Most of the people I spoke with traced Trump's appeal to the economy and particularly to the issue of trade. Union officials worried that if Hillary Clinton didn't match Trump's zeal in opposing the Trans-Pacific Partnership trade deal, she would lose Democratic votes in the region, and with them the state of Ohio. And that is essentially the story I wrote.

But a few people voiced a different view of Trump's appeal in Youngstown. For them, Miller's comments reflect what they've long said: that Trump's popularity in Youngstown has a lot to do with race. Unsurprisingly, those people were black.

""I have some other strong personal feelings about this that nobody wants to talk about,"" Jaladah Aslam, a former public sector union employee and former local Democratic Party official, told me this summer. ""This whole racist rhetoric plays well with some people here.""

Aslam recalled footage she had seen of a clash between supporters and protesters at a Trump rally. ""I saw a man screaming at this one guy, 'Go back to Africa,' and I'm like, 'Really? We're talking like that again?'"" she said. ""That means that people never gave up that thinking."" When it comes to Youngstown and its environs, Aslam believes nasty rhetoric toward African Americans never went away; it just went out of sight.

Aslam was born and raised in Youngstown. In the late 1990s, she left the city limits and bought a house in the suburb of Austintown Township. Her first summer in the neighborhood, she was in her backyard when she overheard a visitor at her neighbor's house a few yards over. ""I don't believe this shit,"" her neighbor's friend said. ""The nigger has the new pool in the neighborhood."" The incident alerted her to the way some locals think and talk about black people when they don't think black people are listening: ""In their mind, why should somebody of color have anything nice?""

Trump's rise reminded Aslam of that summer day nearly two decades ago. ""It comes back to me in the moment of Trump because it reminds me of that thought process, it reminds me people feel that way,"" she said. ""And unfortunately, there are a lot of people who feel that way [in Youngstown]. There are a lot of people who are comfortable with what Trump says about Hispanics and Muslims.""

Aslam's hunches are borne out by academic research. Last year, a doctoral student at Cleveland State University found that the American metropolitan area where the N-word showed up most frequently as an internet search term was Youngstown. He published his findings in the Cleveland Plain Dealer, noting that research out of Harvard shows that search data ""does actually correlate with other measures of racism"" and that ""the private use of coarse racial terminology is the first stage of prejudice.""

Youngstown might not be an obvious epicenter of American racism, but its history helps explain its racial tensions. There's academic research demonstrating that support for far-right nationalist political parties in Europe correlates with a perceived loss of power at the hands of immigrants or other ethnic groups—a fact that helps explain Trump's rise in Youngstown and the dynamic Aslam sensed for years. At 45 percent black and 9 percent Latino, Youngstown is a majority-minority city.

""Growing up in this community, there has always been a racist undertone here.""
""The Trump phenomenon is basically a middle-class white movement because they feel disenfranchised, they feel like they are losing out,"" Rufus Hudson, an African American former Youngstown city council member who serves on the local Democratic Party's executive committee, told me when I visited. ""I think there's that quiet undertone that after eight years of Barack Obama, there's people that think, 'We're falling behind, we're not getting our fair share.'"" With Miller's remarks this week, all of a sudden it wasn't so quiet anymore.

""Growing up in this community, there has always been a racist undertone here,"" Hudson said. ""I actually didn't realize that until I moved away. When I moved to Houston, and I lived down there [for 10 years] and then I come back, and it's like, wow, I mean, it's like kind of in your face."" He nodded toward the car he drives, a Lexus. As a black man driving a nice car, he said he had been pulled over 17 times in the area but had never been issued a citation.

By Thursday evening, the Trump campaign had found a new Mahoning County chair, a black state GOP official from Youngstown named Tracey Winbush. Upon joining the campaign, she immediately deleted her entire Twitter history of about 17,000 tweets. Many of them had been critical of Trump. In February, following Trump's first win of the Republican primary campaign, she tweeted out an article bearing the headline, ""A Racist, Sexist Demagogue Just Won The New Hampshire Primary."""
100015,1005,"Ted Cruz Endorses Trump After Calling Him a ""Sniveling Coward""",http://www.motherjones.com/politics/2016/09/ted-cruz-endorses-donald-trump-order-defeat-hillary-clinton,1,"For months, Ted Cruz has refused to endorse Donald Trump, making Cruz a hero to some Republicans who remain opposed to Trump. But that ended on Friday when Cruz announced he would support his former rival.

""After many months of careful consideration, of prayer and searching my own conscience, I have decided that on Election Day, I will vote for the Republican nominee, Donald Trump,"" Cruz wrote in a Facebook post.

At the Republican National Convention in July, rather than endorse Trump, Cruz urged Republicans to ""vote your conscience,"" drawing shouts and boos from the audience. On Friday, he said his own conscience told him to support Trump. ""If Clinton wins, we know—with 100% certainty—that she would deliver on her left-wing promises, with devastating results for our country,"" he wrote. ""My conscience tells me I must do whatever I can to stop that.""

Cruz had some good reasons not to endorse Trump, stemming from the nasty primary battle between them. Trump has repeatedly attacked members of Cruz's family. In February, Trump went after Cruz's wife, Heidi, threatening in a tweet to ""spill the beans"" about her. Trump then retweeted an unflattering photo of Heidi next to a better one of his own wife, Melania. Cruz's response: ""Donald, you're a sniveling coward. Leave Heidi the hell alone.""

But Trump wasn't done going after Cruz's family. Toward the end of the primary, Trump suggested that Cruz's father might have been involved in the assassination of President John F. Kennedy. When Cruz refused to endorse Trump at the convention this summer, Trump promptly revived this accusation.

Cruz cited these attacks to defend his decision not to endorse Trump at the Republican National Convention in July. ""I am not in the habit of supporting people who attack my wife and attack my father,"" he said at the time. Now his habits appear to have changed."
100016,1006,"Trump advisor: “Every critic, every detractor, will have to bow down to President Trump”",http://hotair.com/archives/2016/09/23/trump-advisor-every-critic-every-detractor-will-bow-president-trump/,1,"The advisor is Omarosa Manigault, formerly of “The Apprentice” and currently head of African-American outreach for Trump’s campaign. Team Trump will spin this as just her opinion when they’re pressed on it but it’s actually one of the best summations of Trumpism I’ve seen since he got in the race. BuzzFeed published a long piece by McKay Coppins two months ago arguing at length, with supporting examples, that this really is Trump’s core motive in running for president — revenge on the political class that’s spent 30 years treating him as a joke, most notably after Obama humiliated him at the 2011 White House Correspondents Dinner. Nationalism and the wall and “terrific trade deals” are all fine but in the end the campaign is chiefly Trump’s personal revenge on his elite critics with various populist revenge fantasies against his base’s political enemies bundled into that. A Twitter pal once speculated that what Trump wants out of the presidency more than anything is to know that he can walk into any room in the world and everyone will have to stand for him. That’s it exactly, I think, and that’s why voters who feel humiliated by well-heeled egghead elites in a thousand different ways are willing to indulge Trump anything. He’s a vessel for their revenge too. You don’t have to take it from me; just watch Omarosa. Her delivery of these lines, describing critics prostrating themselves before Trump, is almost sensual.

The timing may be coincidental but it’s fortuitous that this is circulating on the very day that Ted Cruz finally kneeled before Zod. As I write this, confused Cruzers are asking each other on Twitter what Cruz could possibly gain by endorsing Trump now. (Answer: Donor dollars. All true populists do whatever their rich, pissed-off donors tell them to, you know.) A better question, though, is what Trump gains by having Cruz back him. In theory Cruz’s support will win over some conservatives who have been holding out on Trump, but I don’t know. Nothing Cruz says will be as convincing to Trump-skeptic Republicans as the horror of a Supreme Court packed by Hillary Clinton will be, which is to say that Trump doesn’t really need Cruz’s support. He may want his support, though, simply because Cruz happens to be one of those detractors who hasn’t yet bowed down. Trump wants the satisfaction of watching the beta male whose wife and father he insulted forced to scrape to him publicly anyway. It’s a revenge fantasy. All of it is. I hope he at least has the decency to return Ted’s balls to him after the election."
100017,1006,Surprise! Team Trump actually taking debate … seriously,http://hotair.com/archives/2016/09/23/surprise-team-trump-actually-taking-debate-seriously/,1,"The spin: Sources from Donald Trump’s campaign have begun bar-lowering gossip ahead of the presidential debate Monday. One source told Chris Hayes “off the record” that Team Trump lives in fear that the Republican nominee is so unschooled that he might just “drop trow” [sic] on stage (via Twitchy):

Off-the-record Trump advisor: ""Frankly we're almost 100% sure he's gonna just drop trow and moon Hillary. We're terrified.""

— Christopher Hayes (@chrislhayes) September 23, 2016
That’s actually “on background,” not “off the record,” and it’s trou (short for trousers). It’s either a joke, or it’s such obvious spin that it amounts to the same thing. Trump has participated in several debates already, and while he’s made missteps, flashing his rear to the cameras or his opponents hasn’t been one of them. The purpose of this spin is to set expectations low enough for the candidate to exceed them and appear to have won. All candidates try this, but I don’t believe that anyone has set the bar so low that merely remaining clothed would qualify as a victory.

The reality: Will we get a full moon on Monday? Not hardly. In fact, as Ken Vogel and Politico’s team reports, Trump and his team have taken this debate and its preparation far more seriously than most have predicted.

Donald Trump’s team has created a detailed analysis of Hillary Clinton’s debate style — including her body language and verbal tics — with the goal of helping the GOP nominee exploit weaknesses during Monday’s debate, according to three sources familiar with Trump’s preparations.

The “psychological profile,” as the analysis is being called, is based on a statistical analysis of videos from 16 years’ worth of Clinton’s debates, dating back to her 2000 campaign for Senate in New York, according to the operatives. They said it was assembled with assistance from a political data firm called Cambridge Analytica that specializes in “psychographic” modeling of voters and donors, and that Trump’s top advisers have been pleased with the results.

The advisers believe that the profile proves that Clinton has significant weaknesses and that they have identified her ‘tells’ — words, phrases or gestures she uses when she’s unsure of an answer, or is trying to deflect her way out of an uncomfortable question, according to the operatives familiar with the preparations.

For example, according to one of the sources, an operative who works with the campaign, Trump’s debate prep team believes that the profile proves that when “she doesn’t know the answer, she says this, etc.” The goal, said the operative, is to get Trump to recognize the tendencies, “so when he hears her say ‘X’ he knows what is going on, and can respond accordingly.”
That’s … rather sophisticated, no? Every speaker has their tics and predictable patterns. For instance, when Trump feels he’s laid down a particularly good applause line, he’ll turn 90 degrees to the right for a moment. That’s not a particularly useful tell, but there almost certainly are others. Team Hillary might be doing the same kind of research now, although Trump seems far less predictable than Hillary.

That may be the conundrum. The key to making this strategy a success is whether Trump can maintain enough discipline and awareness on stage to take advantage of this knowledge. His natural inclination is to stay extemporaneous, so he has that flexibility, but that ad-libbing can lead Trump down rabbit holes and take him off the path, too.

However, he has become significantly more disciplined over the last several weeks and has employed better tactics and strategy — especially after Hillary’s collapse in New York. The primary version of Donald Trump would have found ways to step all over that news cycle, but the September version of the candidate kept the focus on Hillary. He’s improving, and that may be one reason why the polling has reverted back to a close race.

As I wrote in my column yesterday for The Fiscal Times, this is a winnable debate for Trump, but discipline is the key to that success:

Thanks to expectations set by the Clinton campaign, Trump can easily gain the advantage by adopting the stage presence of a thoughtful statesman. It sounds trite, but Clinton is so unliked and distrusted by voters that Trump could gain the edge just by making himself appear to be a rational alternative. That will take a lot of discipline for Trump to maintain, and no small amount of cramming on policy to at least sound schooled on the broad strokes, but it’s an achievable goal.

That just accounts for the defense in the debate. Trump likes to go on offense, sometimes so eager that he ends up damaging his own cause, but Clinton gives Trump plenty of targets on which to focus. She will undoubtedly emphasize her own experience and point to Trump’s own lack of preparation for the job.

Trump has to refocus that argument on the Clinton establishment and the corruption between the State Department and the Clinton Foundation – such as the discovery by the Washington Examiner that nearly 40 percent of State Department appointments to advisory boards went to foundation donors. Anti-establishment fervor drove the 2016 primary cycle and remains a potent force, and only Trump has an opening to define the election on those populist terms. …

All of this advice is predicated on Trump’s sense of discipline and preparation, and that’s based on his improved performance on the campaign trail since mid-August. Will he succeed in sticking to a strategy and win the debate? To parallel Silver, the Trump from six weeks ago might have had a one-in-ten shot, but the Trump – and Clinton – of late make it almost a 50:50 proposition.
The preparation seems to be exceeding expectations. Let’s see if the same will be true of the discipline on stage."
100018,1006,Inevitable: Ted Cruz finally endorses Donald Trump,http://hotair.com/archives/2016/09/23/inevitable-ted-cruz-finally-endorses-donald-trump/,1,"I predicted in July that a Cruz cave was inevitable and that he’d do it in a press release in October. In reality he did it in a Facebook post on September 23rd. My bad.

Literally nothing in this statement with the small exception of Trump’s new position on ICANN couldn’t have been said onstage at the convention in Cleveland. But Cruz made two calculations at the time: One was that the backlash to him if he withheld his endorsement wouldn’t be severe, the other was that Trump would be clobbered by Clinton this fall. If both of those bets came through, he’d be rewarded as the man who saw a debacle coming and stood on principle. But he was wrong on both counts, just like he was grossly wrong in betting earlier this year that there enough true conservatives in the Republican base to hand him a victory over Trump in the primaries. Everyone, from his donors to the party establishment to the tea party he champions, chose Trump over him when they were made to choose. He could either risk his career by continuing to hold out or he could go along with them now, knowing that if he went on resisting and Trump lost a close election in November, his refusal to endorse would be cited by angry Republicans as a key factor in the defeat. (Which would be stupid and untrue, but oh well.) He’d be one of the biggest scapegoats for Trumpers in the aftermath. So Ted Cruz, “man of principle,” caved.

If he wanted to be the lesser-of-two-evils guy, he could have been that in May. If he wanted to be the man of principle, he could have been that too. And he was, for a few months. Trying to be both now makes him an opportunistic joke.

In Cleveland, I urged voters, “please, don’t stay home in November. Stand, and speak, and vote your conscience, vote for candidates up and down the ticket whom you trust to defend our freedom and to be faithful to the Constitution.”

After many months of careful consideration, of prayer and searching my own conscience, I have decided that on Election Day, I will vote for the Republican nominee, Donald Trump.

I’ve made this decision for two reasons. First, last year, I promised to support the Republican nominee. And I intend to keep my word.

Second, even though I have had areas of significant disagreement with our nominee, by any measure Hillary Clinton is wholly unacceptable — that’s why I have always been #NeverHillary.

Six key policy differences inform my decision.
Read the statement for his reasoning. He has one very good argument (the Supreme Court) and one good one (energy) — both of which, again, were available to him as justifications in July. For some reason, they weren’t compelling enough at the time. Cruz doesn’t explain what changed. The best he can do to justify his evolution is to mention (as expected) Mike Lee’s inclusion on the list of SCOTUS candidates Trump released this morning, even though no one believes Trump will reward a fierce critic of his like Lee with an appointment. In fact, Trump’s original list of SCOTUS candidates was released in May, months before the convention, and was widely praised even by Trump’s conservative critics for the caliber of judges it featured. If Cruz was really worried about Trump appointing Scalia types, that list, not this morning, could have been cited in Cleveland.

His policy reasoning elsewhere is weak. Trump will be better than Clinton on health care, he says. Maybe, maybe not: Trump has talked up single-payer before and was slobbering over Medicaid just days ago, and unlike Hillary, Trump might get a Republican Congress to go along with all of that. Trump will be better on national security, Cruz insists. In some ways, absolutely; in other ways, like having a Putinist in command of the U.S. armed forces, not so much. Trump will be better on immigration, though, at least, Cruz continues. That’s true enough — it’d be hard to be worse than Hillary — but Trump has been pushing some variation of touchback amnesty for months and even now won’t rule out legalization for illegals. A few weeks ago, during his “softening” period, he was making sympathetic noises about illegals with families who’ve been here for years. Who knows what he’ll do once he’s in office? It’ll be better than Clinton, sure, but Ted Cruz has been selling himself for years now as the guy who will not accept “what we’re doing is slightly better than what the Democrats are doing” excuses from the Republican establishment. Bold colors, not pale pastels — that’s the Cruz motto. Or was, until now, when he ends up exactly where Rush Limbaugh was in defending Trump’s maternity-leave proposal: So long as Trump’s proposals can be defended as somewhat more right-wing than what Clinton would give us, that’s conservative enough. If that’s the guy Cruz is now, he’d better never open his mouth to criticize Mitch McConnell again.

But in a way, all of the policy arguments against Trump are beside the point. The core argument against Trump from the right isn’t that he’s not conservative enough; if that were disqualifying, you need to believe there’d be a #NeverKasich contingent if Kasich were the nominee. There wouldn’t be. Everyone would be all-in against Clinton. The core argument against Trump is that he’s unfit for office in terms of qualifications, temperament, and basic morals. He’s a con artist, like fellow Trump endorser Marco Rubio said. And the key point here is that Cruz himself has made that argument. Remember his big blow-up at Trump on the morning of the Indiana primary? Remember when he called him a “sniveling coward” for insulting his wife? Remember the day after his convention speech when he told the Texas delegation that he wouldn’t be a “servile puppy dog” towards someone who’d attacked his family as viciously as Trump did? Cruz doesn’t grapple with any of that in his endorsement. Evidently, if you’re running against Hillary Clinton — or really any Democrat, since few of Cruz’s objections are specific to Clinton — you can be as personally wretched as you like and Ted Cruz, man of principle, who became a big deal on the right for refusing to go along with his party, will … go along with his party. Steve Deace:

The conservative graveyard is littered with the remains of would-be champions, who buried themselves after misspending their political capital, and choosing the wrong hills to die on. Men and women who didn’t know when to hold ‘em and when to fold ‘em. Who didn’t know when to walk away, and when to run.

As someone that knows, respects, and loves Ted Cruz, my fear is his endorsing Trump risks adding his name to that tragic list. And given the fact Cruz is one of the last remaining constitutional champions we have, if he falls he won’t fall alone.
Trump is out with a statement thanking him for his endorsement but that’s less interesting than this is. Never mind my prediction — Trump himself knew back in July that Cruz would come crawling eventually, and he made his disdain clear by saying he wouldn’t even want the endorsement when it arrived. That’s how little he cared about it. And Cruz, hearing that, endorsed him anyway. Total humiliation:

Somebody got booed the hell out of a place by thousands and thousands of people. There wasn’t one person in the room — not one. And then they said there may not be unity. Unity? There wasn’t one person in the room, including the Texas delegation, right? Honestly, he may have ruined his political career.

I feel so badly. I feel so badly. And you know, he’ll come and endorse over the next little while. He’ll — because he has no choice. But I don’t want his endorsement. What difference does it make? I don’t want his endorsement. I have such great — I don’t want his endorsement. Ted, stay home, relax, enjoy yourself.
Cruz was given a choice, essentially, between a primary fight and dishonor. He chose dishonor. Maybe he’ll get that primary fight anyway."
100019,1007,Trump Earns Surprising Endorsement From Tea Party Patriots,http://www.youngcons.com/trump-earns-surprising-endorsement-from-tea-party-patriots/,1,"One of the most interesting story lines of the 2016 Republican primary was the belief that the grassroots conservatives couldn’t support Trump.

We saw the #NeverTrump movement gain strength and a lot of people thought that would be enough to stop Trump.

It wasn’t and most of the prominent #NeverTrumpers are starting to back down and realize that policy differences with Trump are nothing compared to policy differences with Hillary.

It looks like a major Tea Party group is acknowledging that it is time to back Trump even if they don’t like it.

From The Daily Caller:

During the Republican presidential primary, the Tea Party Patriots said Ted Cruz was their guy and Donald Trump was not one of them. Times have changed.

The super PAC aligned with the tea party organization announced Thursday they are officially endorsing Trump for president and will work to get their supporters out to the polls for the Republican nominee.Interesting.

Trump isn’t conservative enough for some people on a lot of issues. Fair enough.

But the time to argue about that is over.

It’s a two person race.

Time to make a choice."
100020,1007,Hillary Shouting During Interview Points Directly to Parkinson’s,http://www.youngcons.com/hillary-shouting-during-interview-points-directly-to-parkinsons/,1,"An anesthesiologist (and many other top doctors) believes Hillary Clinton suffers from Parkinson’s disease.

When she was secretary of state, Hillary Clinton had a staffer research a Parkinson’s drug.

Interesting, no?

Grandma’s medical episodes have made people more and more aware that she’s physically and mentally unfit to hold office.Heck, she can even be seen traveling with an ambulance in her motorcade.

Now, one person believes Hillary’s latest outburst is proof she has the disease… More on the “scream”…

From Breitbart:

She pointed out that she was against “Right To Work” and appeared upset that Trump was gaining in the polls despite his record of supporting it.

“Having said all this, ‘Why aren’t I 50 points ahead?’ you might ask,” she said, highlighting Trump’s anti-Labor union stance. Boy, that was tough to watch.

Everyone knows why you’re not “50 points ahead,” grams.

People don’t like you.

You’re a liar.

That help?"

In certain cases, they literally can’t control themselves when they are talking about him.

That’s what happened in the following video.

A woman absolutely lost her mind trying to harass a Trump supporter. From BizPac Review:

“I was passing it today […] and there was a big, ugly redneck guy standing in the driveway, so I gave him the finger,” the animated woman explained. “Which I’m allowed to do with my First Amendment freedom of speech rights.” “And this mother f**ker got in his car and chased me!” the woman continued, as she sat on the side of the road after a police officer got involved.

The cop — when he could get a word in edgewise — tried to appeal to the woman to not let her emotions get the better of her and to “just move on” instead of giving obscene gestures to those she disagrees with, and this really set her off. Man, you feel bad for that cop don’t you?

General rule of thumb, anything that makes liberals this mad has to be a good thing.

It would be scary to agree with someone who is clearly unhinged like this."
100022,1008,Hillary's Pneumonia Hokum: A Timeline,http://www.americanthinker.com/articles/2016/09/hillarys_pneumonia_hokum_a_timeline.html,1,"Only four days after I wrote ""The Decrepit Candidate"" here at American Thinker, Hillary Clinton took ill at the 9/11 fifteenth anniversary memorial ceremonies in New York City, ditched her press pool, left prematurely, and was unceremoniously stuffed, stiff as a board, into her van to escape to daughter Chelsea's apartment.  Thanks to a citizen video, taken by Zdenek Gazda and now viewed by millions of people worldwide, we know that the Clinton campaign's original statement that Hillary became ""overheated"" is a lie.  OK, let's be more charitable here – if Hillary did indeed overheat and become dehydrated, then it was a partial truth, but it was made a lie because it wasn't the whole story.

After Gazda's video became public, a new excuse explanation was needed, and it was provided by Hillary's personal physician, Dr. Lisa Bardack, who has written that she examined Hillary on Friday, September 9, performed tests, and diagnosed ""a mild non-contagious bacterial pneumonia"" (whatever that is; probably a simplified description in layman's terms).  Hillary was put on antibiotics (for the second time since September 2) and told to rest.  Presumably ignoring the good doctor's advice, Hillary returned to full-bore campaigning and fundraising that same day.

I don't doubt that Hillary had pneumonia, but is this also a lie, because it is not the complete story?  We now understand that Hillary is very secretive about her health, as she did not tell either her staff or running mate Tim Kaine of the pneumonia diagnosis until after her Sunday collapse.

I remain skeptical that Hillary is really in good health, and I think there are very good odds that the very secretive Hillary is hiding a degenerative neurological condition from the public, and probably from most everybody except those people closest to her, possibly even from her primary care physician (Dr. Bardack).

If so, then visiting the 9/11 ceremonies was certainly a high-risk event for Hillary to attend, since there were lots of people, lots of things going on with multiple distractions occurring at the same time in an uncontrolled environment, lots of reporters, lots of cameras taking pictures, a lot of chances to spot evidence of a neurological disorder, and not a good time for something to go ""wrong,"" which it did.

Here's Hillary at the ceremonies, in the early morning before they get underway:

Note her sunglasses.  They have been described as ""cobalt-blue"" by sharp internet sleuths, and they do seem to be special glasses designed to block red-spectrum frequencies of light (which can trigger or aggravate seizures in people with certain neurological disorders).  You can detect this because the glasses are completely black in front of Hillary's face (since they are absorbing the red frequencies of daylight, so Hillary's flesh-toned face cannot be seen), but the portion of the glasses that are in front of a man's white shirt allow the blue frequencies of daylight to pass through to the viewer.

Also note the Big Black Dude in the upper left corner.  This guy is almost never more than a few steps away from Hillary at her public appearances, and I'll say more about him later.

The blue tint of the glasses becomes really obvious in this publicity-stunt picture of Hillary leaving Chelsea's apartment later that day:

The red-spectrum frequencies of daylight are absorbed by the glasses, but the blues are not, so they reflect back to you.
The picture above, taken during the ceremonies, has been described as ""squeeze my fingers,"" a test for feeling and/or muscle strength in the fingers.  It's not clear in this photo if Hillary's companion, Christine Falvo, a former co-worker of Hillary's at the State Department who now works for a New York City public relations firm, is actually administering a neurological test.  Perhaps some intrepid journalist could ask Chuck Schumer, the onlooker on the left, if he recalls what was going on here.

When Hillary became ""overheated and dehydrated,"" she left the ceremonies for the street, where her van would pick her up.  In the photo below, taken as she leaves the site, Christine Falvo is seen supporting Hillary, while Hillary has her right hand clasped to her chest.  This is a classic maneuver taken by people with Parkinson's Disease to disguise hand tremors, but we can't tell from just a snapshot if that is what Hillary is doing here.  We would need to see a video to determine if Hillary executed this maneuver for any length of time.



Note that the Big Black Dude is right behind Hillary, just a step away.  (Also, note that Christine's sunglasses are not reflecting only blue light.)

At the street, Hillary used the post (technically, a bollard) and the assistance of Christine Falvo to stay erect.  You can see that her knees are weak, but she is otherwise stiff as a board.  The Big Black Dude has just slid open the door of the van.

In the above freeze-frame of the Gazda video, at the moment that Hillary is heaved into the van, her knees have buckled, but her upper torso is still stiff.  Christine is still trying to hold her upright as she, the Big Black Dude, and an unidentified person on the right tip her forward and lift her into the van.

Some of the dinosaur media have reported that Hillary ""stumbled at the curb"" and ""fell into the van.""  Others reported that she ""fainted.""  This shows the extremely low quality of ""journalism"" today, describing things that just didn't happen, as you can see for yourself in the video.  Hillary didn't ""stumble""; she buckled at the knees.  She didn't ""faint"" (lose consciousness and go limp).  Hillary herself says she didn't faint, and for once she might be telling the truth, because the video shows that she was apparently awake but immobile.  She was having a seizure of some kind.

Of course, this is not the first time Hillary has become rigid and unresponsive on the campaign trail.  Take a look at what transpired on August 4, 2016 at her campaign rally in Las Vegas:


A ""silent demonstrator"" in the audience waves a flag. Hillary freezes

With Hillary still motionless and speechless, the Big Black Dude rushes to her side.

He puts his right arm on her shoulder and speaks to her.

In the comforting embrace of the Big Black Dude, Hillary starts to snap out of her trance.

Here's what the Big Black Dude said to Hillary:

""It's OK.  We're not going anywhere.  Keep talking…""

The demonstrators were never a security threat.  This is not telling Hillary that she isn't in danger – this is a medical intervention to get her to snap out of her trance.

If you're in doubt, look what transpired afterward:


While Hillary was frozen, two guys, who are almost certainly Secret Service agents from Hillary's protective detail, moved toward her from her right.

Hillary recovers from her trance and starts talking, rephrasing what the Big Black Dude said to her: ""OK.  Here we are.""  She then gives her infamous Wicked Witch of the West cackle and continues: ""OK, we'll keep talking.""

Meanwhile, the Big Black Dude, who does not possess the physique of your typical Secret Service man, leans over and says something to one of the agents, and they walk away from the podium.  (The complete video is here.)  Who is this guy, that he has the power to tell Secret Service agents what to do?

Above is a picture from 2010, when Bill Clinton had heart surgery to install two stents.  To Bill's left is the Big Black Dude, who was Bill's medical aide (note clothing) and who accompanied Bill and monitored him while he was recovering.

The Big Black Dude (on right, still dressed in civvies) was a staple of Hillary's campaign from almost the beginning, as this early campaign photo shows.  So this is a man known to and trusted by the Clintons, no doubt because of his medical assistance during Bill's recovery.

Surely you remember this picture from February 2016, when the dinosaur media reported that Hillary slipped on the steps and needed assistance to reach the porch.  My question is, slipped on what?  It was a beautiful South Carolina day.  There is no snow, ice, or wet surface.  No banana peel, even.  She could have tripped, maybe, or stumbled, but slipped?  I don't think so.  Lifting Hillary to the top of the steps on the left is the ever-present Big Black Dude, and an unidentified person is helping her up on her right side.

So my question is, if Hillary is in excellent health as reported by Dr. Bardack, with hypothyroidism (under control with medication) and ""seasonal allergies"" (for a very long allergy season, January to December) which cause her to cough as her only chronic conditions, then why does she have the Big Black Dude, who apparently functions as some sort of medical assistant, constantly at her side?

If we knew the identity and role in Hillary's campaign of the Big Black Dude, I think we might have the answer whether or not Hillary has an undisclosed medical condition, specifically a neurological problem.  It might not be Parkinson's Disease, as Dr. Ted Noel suspects from the strong circumstantial evidence.  It could be ongoing damage from her 2012 concussion, or some other problem.

So here is a challenge for you intrepid journalists who are on the campaign trail with Hillary.  (Are you listening, Andrea Mitchell?)  Next time you talk to her campaign manager, Robby Mook, ask him these questions:

Who is the Big Black Dude?
Who writes his paycheck?  The government, or the Clinton campaign?
What is his purpose in the campaign?
Is he a doctor or medically trained?
Then see if you can get straight answers from Robby, not a pack of lies or obfuscations interspersed with Trump-trashing.

Oh, I forgot.  You'd have to leave Clinton Protection Mode to do real investigative reporting.  Ain't gonna happen.

Going forward, there are two things that will be dogging Hillary if she is indeed hiding a neurological condition:

Steve Bannon and Kellyanne Conway, the folks directing Trump's campaign, are not stupid people.  If they think Hillary is hiding poor health, and especially if they suspect she has Parkinson's Disease, they can try to arrange ""triggering"" events for Hillary to cope with during her campaign rallies or speaking gigs.  If Hillary exhibits a few more ""brain freezes"" or coughing fits before November 8, that might not be enough to get her to quit the race, but it might convince many more voters that Hillary is too sick to be elected president, thus they won't vote for her.
Every public appearance Hillary makes is a high-risk event.  Her campaign can try to control this risk by cutting back the number of her public events, and by choosing small venues with tiny audiences so the environment can be more tightly controlled.  But it's still risky – surprises can, and will, happen.
And now everybody is waiting, watching, and analyzing.

100023,1008,Trump and the Anti-Elite ‘Intellectual’ Moment,http://www.americanthinker.com/articles/2016/09/trump_and_the_antielite_intellectual_moment_.html,1,"If people call you an “intellectual,” you might not be so smart.

You may be an impostor, a two-legged adjective posing as a deep thinker. 

A true person of intellect is a thinker of thoughts, who uses his or her head -- not as an advertisement -- but as a tool to greater understanding.

Just as important, a real thinker wonders whether he or she has not seen the full picture, whether there is not much more to learn.

“It is better to know some of the questions than all of the answers,” wrote James Thurber, an author and cartoonist at The New Yorker. In a sense Thurber, was re-working an idea embraced by Talmudic scholars.

“Who is the smart man?” asks the Talmud, answering: “He (or she) who learns from every man.” (Ethics of the Fathers, Chapter IV).

A real thinker combines a sharp head with an open mind -- “brain smarts” with the kind of emotional intelligence that not only admits possible error but actively seeks others who may know more or may know better.

By this rule, many of the “intellectual class” are dumb indeed, so smugly sure of themselves that they simply insult those with whom they disagree.

This takes place on many subjects, but the most jarring is climate change.

“Intellectuals” like President Barack Obama or New York Times columnist Tom Friedman, insult those with doubts about alleged man-made climate change. They berate the doubters as “unscientific” idiots who endanger the security of the United States and the future of the world.

“Trump Win Could Make Climate Catastrophe Inevitable,” headlines Mother Jones magazine in a recent article. This is like saying “if Donald Trump wins, the world will end.”  This kind of pseudo-religious-end-of-days contention (masquerading as science) has driven people with common sense to doubt the wisdom of our so-called “intellectuals.” It has also helped Trump.

Indeed, if Trump wins and the world does not end, he may get messiah status, if not the Nobel Peace Prize that went to a man who acted like he was saving the world (Obama) but actually brought it many disasters.

President Obama has never shown convincingly that “climate change” is, as he claimed, the top danger facing the United States, but on this and other matters he and his colleagues have taken a smug We-know-best posture ruling out all debate.

The climate debate is only one of many arenas for the false intellects. Obama steadfastly refuses to admit that Islamic terror is a more real and immediate danger to US national security than climate warming, observed Jack Welch, the former CEO of General Electric in a recent interview.  Welch is an executive who succeeded by recognizing and fixing problems

Indeed, “Islamic terrorism” is a term Obama will not use. He sticks to his I-know-Islam-better-than-Muslims-know-Islam mantra, even to the point of saying that Islamic terrorists are not really Islamic.

“Now let’s make two things clear: ISIL is not ‘Islamic,’” Obama declared in a major national   security speech on September 10, 2014.

“No religion condones the killing of innocents, and the vast majority of ISIL’s victims have been Muslim,” Obama said with typical superciliousness, sure of himself to the point of omniscience.

Many of Obama’s points were illogical non-sequiturs that were both   misleading and factually wrong. Anyone who has studied Islam or taken a course in comparative religion knows that.  But Obama studied with Rev. Jeremiah Wright and Dr. Edward Said -- not exactly real experts on Islam.

For over 1,300 years Islamic groups have attacked other Islamic groups: Sunnis fought Shiites, Shiites raided Kharijites, Wahabbis struck Hashemites, and many more. They were all Muslim. The common ground is/was believing they were/are the “true” Muslims.

Islamic groups often attack Muslims first, and then, these Islamic groups or sects will continue to attack non-Muslims, such as Christians, Jews, Pagans, Hindus, Buddhists, and other infidels. The fact that they kill more Muslims before killing non-Muslims does not mean that they are not Islamic. 

The term “Islamic State” is designed to recall the structure of the Islamic state that began in Medina under Muhammad, Islam’s messenger, and that continued under various caliphates -- states or empires headed by men who saw themselves as the khalifa (deputy, in Arabic) of Muhammad.

The Islamic State organization is named in Arabic “al-dawla al-islamiyya fi-al-Iraq wa-al-Sham” which means “Islamic State in Iraq and the Levant,”  [hence ISIL]. term “al-sham” in Arabic means the crescent that includes Syria, Lebanon, Jordan and Israel: the Levant.

The leaders of ISIL consider themselves Muslims, and the vast majority of their victims -- Muslims or non-Muslims -- also consider ISIL to be Muslim.

Barack Obama, who knows little Islamic history and no Arabic (and does not want you to know his grades at Columbia), pretends he is an authority on the subject.  So does Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton.

In a speech this month, Ms. Clinton said Trump was aiding terrorists by calling them Islamic. Clinton claimed the terrorists were rooting for Trump.

“Bringing Islam into the definition of our enemy actually serves the purpose of the radical jihadists,” Mrs. Clinton said -- a remark that was totally unsubstantiated by anecdotal or clinical evidence.

“Trump has made Islam and Muslims part of his campaign, and basically the jihadists see this as a great gift. They are saying ‘oh, please Allah, make Trump president of America.’”  She did not supply any proof for this statement.

As in the case of alleged man-made climate change, Obama-Clinton and their pseudo-intellectual chorus are not willing to address contrary opinions based on the merits. They are not even willing to look at data that contradicts their original prejudice.

Real thinkers do not ignore contrary evidence or silence opposing views, and they certainly do not falsify their data -- something that has happened more than once among the climate-heating orthodox community.

Similar stifling of free debate is evident on many issues, where the insult has replaced the factually-based argument.

Obama, Clinton, and some journalists suggest those with contrary views on abortion, immigration, the economy, crime, Iran, Israel and  terrorism are haters of women, racists, war mongers and  xenophobes.

They always seem to say: “We know the problems and the answers, and so, be good enough to stay out of our way.”

Throughout his time in office, Obama pictured himself and his team as experts on the Middle East, which has since sunk into greater chaos, with great waves of bloodshed and refugees, as terrorism has expanded.

Other world leaders who acted like they knew better but are now out the door or on their way are German Chancellor  Angela Merkel and Britain’s ex-Prime Minister David Cameron.  Their heritage is a refugee crisis and Britain leaving the EU.

So is it any surprise when the search for common sense leads the common man to spurn the so-called elites and so-called intellectuals?

100024,1008,The Anger Is Real,http://www.americanthinker.com/articles/2016/09/the_anger_is_real.html,1,"This weekend, I talked with a distinguished scientist, now retired, who in his day contributed to the production of drugs that saved millions of lives.  This man – I'll call him ""Frank,"" and frank he was – offered an unsolicited critique of the state of Washington, and it was not good.

Frank was equally indignant at Democrats and Republicans, and I had to admit that there has been plenty of blame to go around.  Democrat Harry Reid has behaved for years with the appearance of utter contempt for the welfare of ordinary Americans, while Republican majority leader Mitch McConnell, while more reasonable and well meaning, seems remote and tone-deaf.  You wouldn't hire either of them to oversee your health care, but with the Democratic veto in the Senate, that is what you've got.

As Frank put it, ""they don't give a s--- about us.  Don't give a s--- about anything!  Except themselves.""

That more or less sums it up.  The anger is real, and it is widespread.  It's not just ""deplorables,"" which would include what Hillary and Obama have in the past called Tea Party ""extremists.""  It's broader than that.  It includes high school graduates unable to find decent employment and retired scientists like my friend Frank, who have risen to the top of their profession.  It's not just the traditional red states, either.  As a recent mapping of Trump support shows, it's also strong in Iowa and Wisconsin, Michigan and Ohio, Pennsylvania and New York and New England.

That anger is not going away.  It has been bottled up, and every time Hillary and her ex-boss talk down the Islamic threat, every time there's another outrage such as the transgender bathroom fiasco, every time GDP growth comes in at less than 1%, every time another American company moves to Mexico because Democrats who hate private enterprise refuse to pass corporate tax reform, that bottled up anger grows.

Hillary claims to be ""fighting for us,"" echoing the terms Obama, Kerry, Gore, and her husband Bill have used during every election since Reagan.  But all that fighting hasn't yielded much.  Blue-collar wages, adjusted for inflation, are worse than they were in 1992.  From 2007 to 2012, wages fell for the entire bottom 70% of earners, and they remained stagnant after 2012 until this year.  While wages for service occupations (the fastest growing sector under Obama) grew by 2.5% under President Bush, they fell every year of Obama's first term (data through 2012).  According to CNN Money, the U.S. has lost 5 million manufacturing jobs since 2000.

""Don't give a s---,"" Frank kept saying, his voice rising with anger and rage.

""Yes, I know.  I agree.""  Cool off was what I wanted to say.  I did agree with him, totally, but heads were starting to turn, and I didn't want a scene.  That would do nothing for the cause.  What we needed was more who saw things the way we did.  Enough to win Florida and the other swing states in November.

We could have gone on for hours.  It's not just the economy.  Americans feel less safe than they have at any time since 9/11.  Already Obama has admitted 76,000 Syrian refugees.  Secretary of State Kerry has set a goal of another 100,000 for fiscal 2017.  Hillary, as she said in September 2015, thinks ""the United States should do more.""  We should ""lead the world"" in accepting Mideast refugees.  ""Lead the world"" would mean more than the 800,000 refugees accepted by Germany in 2015.  A recent poll shows that only 14% Americans support admission even of 100,000 Syrian refugees.

I don't know how Frank felt on that particular issue, but I can guess.  Frank is not a partisan – he blames both parties for the mess we're in – but he is a conservative and above all a patriot.  He grew up when it was expected that a young man would get an education, go to work, marry, raise a family, and stick with it for the rest of his life.  Frank has done all of these.

It was getting late, for me at least, so I broke off in the midst of our discussion.

I believe that there are millions of people like Frank in the country today.  They feel betrayed by both parties, but for the last eight years above all by Obama and Clinton.  They're not sure about Trump.  They want to believe in him, and they know what they'd get from Hillary: four more years of Obama.

This is not an ordinary election.  As anyone who has attended a Trump rally can tell you, it's a year in which the pent up anger of the voters is finding an outlet in the one candidate who is truly an outsider.  Unlike a long list of GOP candidates before him, Trump understands the resentment of the ordinary American who has been ignored by the GOP leadership and who has been treated with blatant contempt by Hillary and her staff.

What Trump brings to the table, above all, is the sense that he respects the little guy.  He knows why only 12.8% of Americans approve the job Congress is doing.  He also knows that two thirds of Americans think Hillary ""is not honest and trustworthy.""  Would you trust her with your 401(k)?  That's just part of what you'll do if you elect her.  Calling her ""crooked Hillary"" goes to the heart of the matter, and most Americans get it.  And even those who don't particularly like Trump are starting to realize that he does get it.

What with the stagnant economy and new terrorist attacks, Floridians are restive and resentful toward Washington.  If they're like my friend Frank, they will drive turnout in November to record levels.  My own informal survey shows not just a lot of Florida voters turning to Trump, but a lot of highly motivated voters turning to him.  Those are voters who will get to the polls, no matter what.

Once Trump enters the White House, the country can go back to being a happy, secure, productive place, and my friend Frank can get back to playing golf instead of worrying himself sick over the future of the country he loves.  As for myself, I can write about what progress we're making with 3.5% growth rates, full employment, and wages expanding as they should be, at 5% per annum.  That will be a lot more fun than grousing about the latest progressive outrage, and a lot better for the country.

100025,1009,HILLARY: THE THIRD WORLD HAS A “RIGHT” TO MOVE TO THE UNITED STATES,http://www.powerlineblog.com/archives/2016/09/hillary-the-third-world-has-a-right-to-move-to-the-united-states.php,1,"On Monday, Donald Trump gave a speech on terrorism and immigration in which he said:

We want people to come into our country, but they have to come in legally, through a process…. No one has a right to immigrate to this country.

That should be a truism. But, as Byron York points out, Hillary Clinton responded in a retweet that she disagrees:  In a sensible world, Hillary’s apparent belief that foreigners have a “right” to emigrate to the United States would disqualify her from the presidency. In the first place, she is simply wrong as a legal matter. In United States ex rel. Knauff v. Shaughnessy, 338 U.S. 537 (1950), the U.S. Supreme Court wrote:

At the outset we wish to point out that an alien who seeks admission to this country may not do so under any claim of right. Admission of aliens to the United States is a privilege granted by the sovereign United States Government. Such privilege is granted to an alien only upon such terms as the United States shall prescribe.

The ability to control who enters a country is a fundamental attribute of sovereignty. It is appalling that Mrs. Clinton fails to understand this basic fact.

As a practical matter, a pure open borders policy, as implied by the claim that foreigners have a “right to immigrate to this country,” would be a disaster. Of the world’s 7.4 billion people, at least three billion would be infinitely better off if they were living in the U.S. How many of those three billion–a conservative estimate–is Hillary prepared to accommodate? We already have the world’s third-largest population, trailing only China and India. The volume of immigration is already higher than at any previous time in American history. Hillary Clinton, with her vast wealth and phalanx of armed guards, may be insulated from the consequences of unprecedented immigration, both legal and illegal. But the rest of us are not.

It would be a disaster to elect this woman president."
100026,1009,THERE’S SOMETHING ABOUT HILLARY’S EYES,http://www.powerlineblog.com/archives/2016/09/theres-something-about-hillarys-eyes.php,1,"Yesterday Tom Lifson took note of Hillary’s wandering eyes. Several physicians have written us to observe that they are consistent with a left abducens nerve (CN6) palsy, residual from her cerebral venous sinus thrombosis. Now Dr. John Coppedge elaborates on this thesis in a post at The Hill that he calls “Clinton’s eyes — a window into her health issues.” Dr. Coppedge explains:

Her eyes did not always move in the same direction at the same time. It appears that she has a problem with her left sixth cranial nerve. That nerve serves only one function and that is to make the lateral rectus muscle contract. That muscle turns the eye in the direction away from the midline.

It comes out of the base of the brain and runs along the floor of the skull, immediately beneath the brain before coursing upward to the eye. Dysfunction of that muscle causes the striking picture of the eyes not aiming in the same direction and causes the patient to suffer double vision.

Like all things medical, there is a long list of potential causes but in my opinion the most likely one, based on Clinton’s known medical history is an intermittent lateral rectus palsy caused by damage to or pressure on her sixth cranial nerve.

Dr. Coppedge relates his thesis to Clinton’s 9/11 collapse:

If, as is statistically likely, Clinton’s transverse sinus is still blocked, she would still have increased pressure and swelling and decreased blood flow to her brain. That swelling would place pressure on the exposed portion of the sixth cranial nerve at the base of her brain, explaining the apparent lateral rectus palsy. And such a deficit can be partial and/or intermittent.

Additionally, when patients who have decreased intracranial blood flow becoming volume depleted (dehydrated) or have a drop in blood pressure loss of consciousness can occur. That could explain her witnessed collapse in New York City on 9/11.

Dr. Coppedge concedes that he has sketched out an “admittedly speculative scenario” but argues that it “is an attempt to understand and rationally explain what is going on, based on known facts and the observable signs exhibited by Clinton.” His call for an independent examination is guaranteed not to occur but his post is nevertheless worth a look."
100027,1009,"“BASKET OF DEPLORABLES,” DAVID BROCK EDITION",http://www.powerlineblog.com/archives/2016/09/basket-of-deplorables-david-brock-edition.php,1,"David Brock, who runs neck-and-neck with Sid Blumenthal for the prime spot in Hillary Clinton’s “basket of deplorables,” has repeatedly asked for an inquiry into the Trump Foundation. Fair enough. But how about an inquiry into the affairs of David Brock and his Media Matters operation?

There are solid grounds for such an investigation. Brock may well have engaged in money laundering and he paid his ex-boyfriend $850,000 not to go to the IRS with damaging information about how Brock was running his Media Matters empire. In addition, though this predates Media Matters, he stands accused of illegally obtaining phone records.

The essence of the money laundering allegation is this:

(1) Brock operates over a dozen pro-Clinton organizations from his office in Washington, D.C.

(2) Records expose a constant flow of money between his organizations.

(3) Brock’s unregistered Professional Solicitor, the Bonner Group, receives a 12.5% cut every time money is moved.

The payoff by Brock to his long-time live-in boyfriend William Gray (whom Brock thanked in several of his books) is discussed in this Fox News article, with links to court documents and a police report, about the nasty legal battle between Brock and Gray. Brock admitted making the payments, which he characterized as blackmail.

Brock’s willingness to pay Gray nearly one million dollars certainly suggests he had something mighty important to hide.

The accusation of obtaining illegal phone records is leveled by my friend Mark Paoletta. It dates back to the 1990s when Brock was writing The Seduction of Hillary Rodham (an instructive book, which I discussed here and here) and Mark was helping him.

According to Mark, a draft of the book was mistakenly faxed to the wrong number. Desperate to find out who had received the draft (it turned out to be a Clinton loyalist), Brock persuaded a lawyer at the telephone company to retrieve the unlisted fax number from the company’s database and gave the customer’s identity to Brock. Brock reported to Mark that the phone company lawyer told Brock that providing this information was illegal and he (the lawyer) would be fired if it ever were disclosed.

Brock proceeded anyway. Using the illegally obtained information, Brock’s lawyer contacted the party to whom his book draft had been faxed and was able, through whatever means, to put out the fire.

Flash forward 20 years, and Media Matters reportedly is contemplating suing Fox News for allegedly hacking into the phone records of its officials, including David Brock. If the allegation is correct, one can understand why Media Matters might sue.

Yet, it’s ironic that, according to Mark, Brock himself engaged in similar misconduct. Indeed, one can’t help asking whether there is any sleazy conduct from which Brock would abstain."
100028,1010,"Trump’s new SCOTUS picks signals willingness to abolish child labor laws, Medicare, Social Security",https://thinkprogress.org/mike-lee-donald-trump-supreme-court-1bd71b76ea6f#.37fmjjd7d,1,"Last May, Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump released a list of 11 sitting judges who, he says, fit the ideological mold of the kind of people he will appoint to the Supreme Court if elected president. The list ran the conservative gamut from judges who cut their teeth questioning judicial power to judges who want to revive long-discredited doctrines once used to tear down the minimum wage and other basic labor laws.
On Friday, Trump added 10 names to his list of potential justices. The new list is notable in that it includes a number of fairly obscure judges, including a few who currently serve as trial judges. It also includes people of color, something his first list did not.
The first name on the new list, however, is Sen. Mike Lee (R-UT). A former law clerk to Justice Samuel Alito, Lee describes Sen. Ted Cruz (R-TX) as his “best friend,” and Lee is probably the most conservative member of the United States Senate. To date, he’s also refused to endorse Trump’s presidential candidacy.

Sen. Mike Lee (R-UT) (CREDIT: AP PHOTO/LAUREN VICTORIA BURKE)
Lee’s conservatism, moreover, is rooted in a hard-line understanding of the Constitution that was popular among judges in the early twentieth century but is now widely viewed as wrong and immoral. As a candidate for the senate in 2010, Lee laid out many of the consequences of his vision_—_a vision he would potentially be in a position to implement if appointed to the nation’s highest court. Among other things, Lee believes that federal child labor laws, Medicare and Social Security are all unconstitutional.
A lecture Lee gave in 2010 lecture laid out his understanding of the Constitution in a surprising amount of detail. Among other things, he argued that a measure of cruelty is written into the Constitution itself:
Congress decided it wanted to prohibit [child labor], so it passed a law_—_no more child labor. The Supreme Court heard a challenge to that and the Supreme Court decided a case in 1918 called Hammer v. Dagenhardt. In that case, the Supreme Court acknowledged something very interesting_—_that, as reprehensible as child labor is, and as much as it ought to be abandoned_—_that’s something that has to be done by state legislators, not by Members of Congress. […]
This may sound harsh, but it was designed to be that way. It was designed to be a little bit harsh.
In reality, as I explain in my book Injustices: The Supreme Court’s History of Comforting the Comfortable and Afflicting the Afflicted, state lawmakers were unable to fight child labor, largely because they could not resist the financial incentives to permit it. So long as only one state permitted such labor, cotton mills and other factories would flock to that state in order to take advantage of cheap underage workers. States that didn’t follow suit would lose out, so many of them either repealed their child labor laws or did not meaningfully enforce them.
Indeed, in some cases, states entered into explicit quid pro quo deals with employers. Alabama passed a law limiting child workers to an eight-hour workday in 1887, for example. It repealed the law seven years later after a group of mill owners promised to open a factor in Alabama in return for this repeal.
Federal legislation, in other words, was the only viable source of relief for many children_—_some as young as six_—_forced to spend their formative years in hard labor. Such legislation eventually became possible after Hammer, the decision Lee praises, was unanimously overruled in 1941.
Children would not be the only people who suffered in Mike Lee’s America. The sick and the elderly would also bear a significant burden. Later in Lee’s lecture, the future senator attacks President Franklin Roosevelt for calling on the federal government to provide “a decent retirement plan” and “health care” because “the Constitution doesn’t give Congress any of those powers.”
So say goodbye to Social Security. Say goodbye to Medicare, Medicaid, the Affordable Care Act, and SCHIP. Can’t afford health insurance? Or unable to find an insurer who will cover your preexisting condition? Mike Lee thinks you should get nothing from the federal government.
And, if Trump wins this November, Mike Lee could become Justice Mike Lee."
100029,1010,"Trump praises Egypt’s autocratic president, says they have a lot of ‘chemistry’",https://thinkprogress.org/trump-sisi-chemistry-ffd3560567a5#.xjb08fz2r,1,"Just days after Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump sat down with Egyptian President Abdel Fattah el-Sisi, he called him a “fantastic guy.”
“I thought it was very productive,” Trump said in an interview on Fox News on Wednesday, after being asked about his meeting with Sisi in New York on Monday, on the sidelines of the U.N. Summit for Refugees and Migrants. “He’s a fantastic guy. He took control of Egypt, and he really took control of it, and I thought it was a great meeting. We met for a long time, actually. We had a long meeting, and got along. There was a good chemistry there.”
Trump went on to praise Sisi as someone who took control of the “tremendous problem” of terrorists in Egypt.
“I’ll tell you, he took control of the country, he has gotten the terrorists out and wiped them out, and we talked about that,” he said. “He took a very tough approach, much different than our approach, I can tell you. And he really did pretty much wipe ’em out.”
Trump’s admiration for a leader who has been criticized by multiple human rights organizations is astonishing.
Sisi rose to power in Egypt in 2013 after leading a coup d’etat against President Mohamed Morsi, the first democratically elected president following the 2011 revolution and ouster of Hosni Mubarak. While Morsi faced a lot of criticism during his short presidency, Sisi went on to oversee one of the bloodiest periods in recent Egyptian history: the Rabaa massacre.
Human rights activists are upset over Clinton and Trump’s meetings with the Egyptian president

Clinton broached human rights. Trump didn’t.
thinkprogress.org 
On August 14, 2013, the Egyptian army and security forces used force_—_including live ammunition, bulldozers, and tear gas_—_to disperse people at two camps in Cairo, who were protesting the Sisi-led coup, including in Rabaa al-Adawiya Square. At least 817 people were killed in the confrontations, though the actual number may be over 1,000.
After a year-long Human Rights Watch investigation, Executive Director Kenneth Roth called the Rabaa Massacre “one of the world’s largest killings of demonstrators on a single day in recent history,” and still there hasn’t been any accountability for those involved. “The authorities have failed to hold even a single low-level police or army officer accountable for any of the killings, much less any official responsible for ordering them, and continue to brutally suppress dissent,” Human Rights Watch reported.
Sisi’s rule has also seen a brutal crackdown on the freedom of press. Hundreds of activists have been abducted, tortured, and forcibly disappeared.
“Anyone who dares to speak out is at risk, with counter-terrorism being used as an excuse to abduct, interrogate and torture people who challenge the authorities,” Philip Luther, director of the Middle East and North Africa Programme at Amnesty International, said in July.
But not only has Sisi been terrible for human rights in Egypt, there also isn’t a lot of proof his counterterrorism strategy is working. As ThinkProgress has previously reported:
Since taking power, Sisi’s focus has been on increasing security in Egypt through strict counterterrorism measures. But his efforts have largely failed to bear fruit as there has been an increase in terrorism in Egypt since the coup in 2013, and ISIS has established a solid presence in the Sinai.
After Trump’s meeting with Sisi on Monday, his campaign noted that Trump has “strong support for Egypt’s war on terrorism” and “under a Trump administration, the United States of America will be a loyal friend, not simply an ally, that Egypt can count on in the days and years ahead.”
Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton also met with Sisi on Monday, though there are indications that she brought up human rights in their discussion.
Sisi, for his part, told CNN that he thought Clinton would also make a good president. “Political parties in the United States would not allow candidates to reach that level unless they are qualified to lead a country the size of the United States of America,” he said."
100030,1010,Hillary Clinton gets aggressive on taxing extremely wealthy heirs,https://thinkprogress.org/clinton-estate-tax-f06dc9a23208#.ez1lhcbyr,1,"Since her campaign began, Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton has pledged to raise taxes on the wealthy to help fund many of her policy proposals. But now she’s getting even more aggressive on one way to soak the very richest in particular: the estate tax, levied on money passed down from the wealthy to their heirs.
Originally, Clinton proposed increasing the tax on estates worth $3.5 million or more to 45 percent, raising it back to where it was after President George W. Bush succeeded in whittling it down from 55 percent. On its own, that plan would have raised $160 billion over a decade.
But her new position will go much further. She recently expressed support to the Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget (CRFB) for higher tax rates on the largest estates, along the lines of what Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-VT) was proposing during the primaries. The new rates would be 50 percent for individual estates valued over $10 million, 55 percent over $50 million, and the highest rate of 65 percent over $500 million. (All the thresholds would double for a married couple.) That would bring the highest rate back to where it was in 1982.
Currently, the estate tax is 40 percent on estates worth $5.45 million for an individual or $10.9 million for a married couple. Thanks to intricacies in the tax code and various loopholes the rich can use to shield their estates though, the effective rate is more like 17 percent.
According to the CRFB’s analysis, Clinton’s new proposals for the estate tax would tack on an additional $75 billion in revenue.
That kind of money can go a long way. For instance, it could cover the cost of Clinton’s plans to expand the Child Tax Credit, which helps families afford childcare, and her plan to simplify taxes on small businesses.
And it would only raise revenue from the very wealthiest, leaving the vast majority of Americans untouched. Currently, the estate tax only applies to the wealthiest 0.2 percent. That rate would expand under Clinton’s plan, but just 223 taxpayers in 2014 would have been subjected to the 55 or 65 percent rates.
The estate tax, while certainly a small piece of a much larger tax code, does more than just raise revenue. It was originally created in the United States amid a climate in which companies were rapidly merging into giant monopolies and wealth was concentrating in a few hands, leading to fears of an American plutocracy.
And it can still serve a similar purpose today. Wealth inequality began taking off in the 1970s, coinciding with a change in law that made it cheaper to pass wealth on to heirs rather than give it to charity and gradually increased the eligibility thresholds.
Inequality continued to grow as the estate tax has been reduced over the years. Today, the richest 0.1 percent of Americans hold 22 percent of the country’s wealth, a level of inequality not seen since the roaring 20s. While changing the trend would likely take a number of policies, economists have found that increasing the estate tax “would significantly reduce wealth concentration in the hands of the richest few and would reduce the economic advantage of being born to a super-rich family.”
Republican nominee Donald Trump has already attacked Clinton’s plan, with a spokesman calling it “an even more dramatic hike in the death tax.” Trump’s tax plan would repeal the estate tax entirely."
100031,1001,"New York Times strongly endorses Hillary Clinton, praising her 'intellect, experience, and courage'",http://www.dailykos.com/stories/2016/9/24/1573844/-New-York-Times-strongly-endorses-Hillary-Clinton-praising-her-intellect-experience-and-courage,2,"With just over six weeks to go before Election Day, the New York Times editorial board has issued a powerful endorsement of Hillary Clinton’s campaign for president, and there’s nothing half-hearted or subtle about it:

In any normal election year, we’d compare the two presidential candidates side by side on the issues. But this is not a normal election year. A comparison like that would be an empty exercise in a race where one candidate — our choice, Hillary Clinton — has a record of service and a raft of pragmatic ideas, and the other, Donald Trump, discloses nothing concrete about himself or his plans while promising the moon and offering the stars on layaway.
But, says the Times, their endorsement carries a deeper purpose:

But this endorsement would also be an empty exercise if it merely affirmed the choice of Clinton supporters. We’re aiming instead to persuade those of you who are hesitating to vote for Mrs. Clinton — because you are reluctant to vote for a Democrat, or for another Clinton, or for a candidate who might appear, on the surface, not to offer change from an establishment that seems indifferent and a political system that seems broken.

Running down the other guy won’t suffice to make that argument. The best case for Hillary Clinton cannot be, and is not, that she isn’t Donald Trump.

The best case is, instead, about the challenges this country faces, and Mrs. Clinton’s capacity to rise to them.
And indeed, the paper makes a ringing, affirmative case for why Clinton would be an excellent president, tracing her long public career from her earliest days as an advocate for children who had no voice through her time as secretary of state, when she pushed for sanctions against Iran that ultimately led to last year’s historic nuclear accord. The Times doesn’t shy away from noting Clinton’s mistakes, such as her vote in favor of the Iraq war, but it also offers a stinging rebuke to the overheated coverage of her emails, saying that in light of “the real challenges that will occupy the next president,” Clinton’s email server “looks like a matter for the help desk.”

Please read the entire editorial. And if you know friends who are wavering in their decision this fall, please share it with them, too. It might just convince a few fence-sitters."
100032,1002,Whoops! Hillary Clinton Cancels Planned Trip To Charlotte After Mayor Begs Her To Stay Home,http://www.breitbart.com/2016-presidential-race/2016/09/24/whoops-hillary-clinton-cancels-planned-trip-charlotte-mayor-begs-stay-home/,2,"Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton was forced to cancel her planned trip to Charlotte, after the Democratic mayor of the city begged her on live television to stay home.
Clinton aides announced on Friday afternoon that Hillary would visit the city on Sunday, but were forced to reverse their plans just hours later.

“After further discussion with community leaders, we have decided to postpone Sunday’s trip as to not impact the city’s resources,” noted Clinton’s communications director Jennifer Palmieri in a carefully worded statement released late Friday night.

Charlotte Mayor Jennifer Roberts, a Democrat who has endorsed Hillary Clinton for president, urged the Democratic nominee to postpone her scheduled visit on Sunday in an interview on CNN.

She indicated that both presidential candidates were considering a visit to Charlotte, although Clinton was the only candidate who had announced her plans.

“If there would be a way to delay those visits in terms of giving us a chance to get our city back to order and back to a state of normalcy that would probably be ideal,” Roberts said in an interview with CNN’s Erin Burnett on Friday night.

Although Donald Trump was also considering a visit to Charlotte after the first presidential debate, his campaign also abandoned their plans.

Roberts said she appreciated that the presidential candidates were concerned about the city, but said an early visit would stress the city’s resources.

“At this point we do have very stressed resources for security,” she said. “They are working around the clock.”

Clinton planned visit would have taken place the same day that Charlotte will be hosting an NFL football game, as the Minnesota Vikings play the Panthers. The event will likely be the focal point for additional protests.

The Clinton campaign indicated in their statement that Hillary will visit Charlotte the following Sunday.

 

Trump reacted to the news on Twitter, ridiculing the candidate for not contacting the community first."
100033,1002,Politico: GOP Senators ‘Succumb’ to Donald Trump on Trade,http://www.breitbart.com/2016-presidential-race/2016/09/24/politico-gop-senators-succumb-trump-trade/,2,"Establishment Republican senators up for reelection have “succumbed” to Donald Trump’s America-first trade platform, Politico reports.
The report notes that after years of championing multi-national trade deals, Republican senators who are facing contentious reelections are now rhetorically “sprint[ing] away” from their previous support of President Obama’s Trans-Pacific Partnership agreement.

Opposing the Trans-Pacific Partnership has been a central platform of Trump’s presidential campaign.

Politico writes, “The GOP’s unshakable faith in free trade has been decidedly broken in the year of Trump — with everyone from a former U.S. trade representative, Rob Portman of Ohio, to free-market devotee Marco Rubio of Florida striking a much different tone.”

By “free trade,” the report is referring to what trade experts, such as Nucor Steel Chairman Daniel DiMicco, have described as “unilateral trade disarmament and enablement of foreign mercantilism.”

“[T]he Republican sprint away from the TPP is a remarkable policy reversal for a party that has traditionally championed itself as the party of free trade,” Politico writes.

Indeed, just last year, Republican Senate leaders issued an internal messaging memo to all GOP senators, an exclusive copy of which was obtained and published by Breitbart News. The memo urged GOP senators to meet with business groups during the August recess to tout the GOP’s vote to fast-track Obama’s TPP.

Politico further notes that for several of the senators now rhetorically distancing themselves from the TPP, this represents a complete reversal from their prior statements.

The report states that in April of 2015, Marco Rubio “wrote an op-ed in The Wall Street Journal and urged passage of TPP.” Rubio then delivered the sixtieth and deciding vote to fast-track the TPP. No deal placed on fast-track has ever been blocked, which is why, at the time, Sen. Jeff Sessions suggested that voting to give Obama fast-track authority was essentially a proxy vote for TPP. In an interview with Politico, Rubio appears to now be refusing to take a position on the multinational trade deal that he previously voted to fast-track. However, Rubio did tell Politico that he supports TPP as a concept.

“TPP as a concept is something I support. I’d love to have a free trade agreement with the Asia-Pacific region. But it has to be the right deal,” Rubio said.

Politico notes that other senators, such as Sen. Ron Johnson from Wisconsin, have “simply declined to answer questions about their TPP position.”

“Wisconsin Sen. Ron Johnson has yet to take a stance on TPP and declined in an interview to say whether he even has any concerns,” Politico writes.

Politico notes that with Trump as the party’s standard bearer, “establishment-minded Republicans” up for reelection have been forced to walk a “tightrope” between trying to appeal to Republican voters–who are skeptical of so-called “free trade”–and appease Republican donors and organizations like the Chamber of Commerce and Club for Growth that lobby for more global trade:

The upended politics of trade offer a major conundrum for establishment-minded Republicans running for reelection this year, particularly in Rust Belt states that could help determine control of the Senate next year. Perhaps more than any other issue, trade has illustrated the tightrope GOP candidates have to walk in trying to appeal to Trump-fueled voters while not abandoning the GOP’s core economic principles.

Polling data shows Republican voters are among the most skeptical of so-called “free trade” deals, more so than Democrats. According to Pew, only a vanishing 11 percent of Republican voters believe that so-called “free-trade” will raise wages. By a nearly 5-to-1 margin, Republican voters believe that so-called “free trade” depresses wages, rather than increases wages, and by a greater than 3-to-1 margin, Republican voters believe that “free trade” will kill jobs, not create them."
100034,1002,Jeff Sessions Pushes Back Against Hillary Clinton’s ‘Radical’ Suggestion of a Global Right to Immigrate,http://www.breitbart.com/2016-presidential-race/2016/09/24/jeff-sessions-pushes-back-clintons-radical-suggestion-global-right-immigrate/,2,"Alabama Senator Jeff Sessions pushed back against Hillary Clinton campaign’s “radical” suggestion that foreign nationals living in foreign countries have a global right to immigrate to the United States.
As Byron York first reported, earlier this week, Clinton’s campaign indicated that she believes the world has a global right to immigrate to the United States—a position that essentially dissolves the United States’ status as a sovereign nation.

York explained that on Monday, Donald Trump delivered a speech in which he declared, “We want people to come into our country, but they have to come in legally, through a process. … No one has a right to immigrate to this country.” 

As John Hinderaker noted, such a statement should be understood as a truism. However, via Twitter, Clinton’s campaign responded directly to Trump’s statement and indicated that she “disagreed” with it: Sessions explained that with this tweet, “Hillary Clinton’s campaign revealed the true extent of her radical views on immigration—which apparently are that anyone has the right to demand entry into the United States.”

“In a telling admission, Hillary Clinton’s campaign indicated it disagrees with the fundamental premise the world does not have a right to immigrate to the United States,” Sessions wrote in a Friday statement.

“Hillary Clinton’s policies are as radical as they are unprecedented,” Sessions explained. “We must restore legality to our immigration system to ensure it serves the interests of all Americans, including lawful immigrants. This election may be our last chance to do so.”

Sessions warned that Clinton’s “radical position, if enacted into policy, would result in an unmitigated fiscal disaster for the American people.”

According to Dr. George Borjas’ analysis of recent findings in a report by the National Academy of Sciences, “The national economic gains that accrue from immigration come directly at the expense of wages from those most adversely impacted by immigration—to the tune of roughly $500 billion every year,” Sessions wrote, adding:

Among those hardest hit are minorities and recent immigrants. The large immigrant flows tend to arrive in existing immigrant communities, thus, those communities suffer the greatest wage declines. This means that the dreams for economic prosperity of even recent immigrants are dashed, all because of an insatiable demand for ever more lower-skilled, lower-wage labor.

“For far too long, our immigration system has served the interests of the open-borders advocates—corporate interests who benefit from lower wages that result from greater labor flows,” Sessions wrote.

John Hinderaker echoed Sessions’ sentiment and said that “in a sensible world, Hillary’s apparent belief that foreigners have a ‘right’ to emigrate to the United States would disqualify her from the presidency.”

Hinderaker noted:

 In the first place, [Clinton] is simply wrong as a legal matter. … The ability to control who enters a country is a fundamental attribute of sovereignty. It is appalling that Mrs. Clinton fails to understand this basic fact. As a practical matter, a pure open borders policy, as implied by the claim that foreigners have a “right to immigrate to this country,” would be a disaster. Of the world’s 7.4 billion people, at least three billion would be infinitely better off if they were living in the U.S. How many of those three billion–a conservative estimate–is Hillary prepared to accommodate?

Hinderaker added, “Hillary Clinton, with her vast wealth and phalanx of armed guards, may be insulated from the consequences of unprecedented immigration, both legal and illegal. But the rest of us are not.”"
100035,1003,Trump The Arsonist Plays Firefighter,http://www.huffingtonpost.com/richard-j-rosendall/trump-the-arsonist-plays-_b_12084024.html?utm_hp_ref=politics,2,"Michelle Obama said on September 16, “The presidency doesn’t change who you are, it reveals who you are. The same thing is true of a presidential campaign.” Donald Trump demonstrated the truth of this the same day.

Without explanation or apology, Trump dropped his birther lie against President Obama, and told two more lies: that Hillary Clinton started birtherism, and that he had ended it in 2011. He angered the media in the process by playing them to promote his luxury hotel.

Trump’s heavy-handedness may finally end the false equivalence with which the media have portrayed the major party nominees. The thin case against Hillary (her email server, decades of GOP smears, her every cough being treated like an operatic death scene) pales beside Trump’s nonstop lies and provocations, as his dealmaking pales beside her public service.

Trump’s botched pivot away from birtherism did not dispel the nativist bigots he has riled up, who would sooner pull down our republic than accept the full enfranchisement of women and people of color. Friday evening, repeating his lie that Clinton wants to disarm all Americans, he said of her Secret Service detail, “Take their guns away” and “Let’s see what happens to her.” The previous weekend, Kentucky Governor Matt Bevin threatened bloodshed if Clinton wins. These men who talk about terrorists should look in a mirror.

Who made Trump the arbiter of a candidate’s legitimacy? His slanders and fabrications assume a privilege of passing judgment that disproportionately targets minorities and women. The outrage of African Americans at his attacks on Obama is well expressed by my friend Robert Naylor Jr., a leadership and diversity consultant:

What Mr. Trump has shown during and prior to his campaign is much worse than dog-whistle politics. It’s part of a long-standing, deep-seated effort to denigrate and delegitimize African Americans who don’t fit negative racial stereotypes and who rise to positions of prominence and authority. This underbelly of racism that still exists in our country suggests that African Americans can only achieve through the benevolence of whites, reduced standards, special treatment, cheating, or some combination of those things. One thing I often say to young African American men is that nothing frightens and agitates the racists more than an educated, intelligent, sophisticated black man.
It is hard to observe Trump’s selfishness, recklessness, meanness, compulsive lying, murky foreign ties, and ignorant blather about grave matters without wondering how otherwise decent people can support him. It only makes sense as a destructive impulse borne of bitterness and resentment. Instead of uplift, he offers boasting and bile.

It’s not just on him. The zeal with which Republicans pursue voting restrictions and revile even the mildest gun regulations suggests abandonment of the social compact that makes our diverse people a nation. Fear and ignorance function as a wrecking ball.

The reality-challenged assassins encouraged by Trump’s call to disarm Clinton’s security detail would be shooting at a cartoon villain, just as Cleveland officer Timothy Loehmann was shooting at a stereotype when he killed 12-year-old Tamir Rice in 2014.

Too often white Americans act grievously wounded when criticized, while we take discrimination against others in stride. We are too much like Molière’s Imaginary Invalid for people convinced of our national greatness, hyperventilating over any suggestion that America’s original sin lives on in other guises a hundred fifty years after the Civil War. Thus we deny the white supremacist mindset hiding in plain sight in “stand your ground” and voter ID laws. We tout our Enlightenment values while looking away as our neighbors denounce a planned mosque or harass a woman wearing hijab.

We will discover on November 8 if we have degraded into a silly people swayed by empty promises and brazen ignorance. This summer was the hottest on record; when Trump dismisses climate change as a Chinese hoax, he appeals to our decadence. Any greatness we inherited came from facing challenges, not avoiding them.

Electing a president whom Colin Powell calls “an international pariah” might please those who like nothing better than “sticking it” to friends and enemies alike. Shall America model itself on Trump by being pathologically thin-skinned, stiffing our creditors, and evading responsibility? With such a leader, who needs enemies?

100036,1003,Police Endorsement Of Trump Shows Black Lives Don’t Matter,http://www.huffingtonpost.com/melissa-bartick/police-endorsement-of-tru_b_12154694.html?utm_hp_ref=politics,2,"Whether or not they choose to admit it, there is clearly a breakdown of trust between police and the African American community, and that distrust has spread to the rest of America. We have seen police chiefs refuse to release potentially damning videos to the public (Keith L. Scott, Tamir Rice, Laquan McDonald), tamper with evidence (Laquan McDonald), we’ve seen police plant evidence then collude to cover it up (Walter Scott), we’ve watched as police stood by and said nothing when one of their colleagues performed an illegal chokehold that proved fatal (Eric Garner). We’ve repeatedly watched police render no medical assistance after they’ve mortally injured someone, leaving citizens to die like animals (Michael Brown, Terence Crutcher, Tamir Rice, Kajieme Powell, among many others). Yet police unions continue to be the harshest critics of police reform.

When one group of Americans is brutalized, there is no “justice for all.” Every American is at risk.

But last straw came when the Fraternal Order of Police chose to endorse Donald Trump for President. The FOP didn’t have to endorse any candidate. And yet, in the wake of all the compelling evidence showing racial profiling, in the wake of the 2015 study showing that unarmed blacks are 3.5 times more likely than unarmed whites to be the shot by police, in the wake of the July 2016 report by the Center for Policing Equity showing that “black residents were more likely than white residents to be targeted for use of force,” in the wake of all the high profile police shootings and resultant protests and riots, the nation’s largest police union, comprising roughly 40% of the country’s sworn officers, endorsed an openly racist candidate for President. In their September 16 press release, they backed Trump with such enthusiasm that they used three exclamation points!!!

And Donald Trump is not just any racist candidate. He recruited alt-right, white nationalist Steve Bannon as the CEO of his campaign. Trump is endorsed by numerous white supremacists, Klansman and neo-Nazis who recognize his sometimes coded racist language for what it is. For example, lamenting that America is no longer “a 92% white/European nation,” Rocky Suhayda of the American Nazi Party wrote in September 2015. “We have a wonderful OPPORTUNITY here folks, that may never come again, at the RIGHT time... Donald Trump’s campaign statements, if nothing else, have SHOWN that ‘our views’ are NOT so ‘unpopular’ as the Political Correctness crowd have told everyone they are!” He is consistently supported by only 0-1% of the African American population in the polls.

What does this tell us about how much the police care about African Americans? The nation’s largest police union is basically saying to Black America, “Your lives don’t, in fact, matter at all. Black blood does not matter. We give you the collective middle finger.” Well, Black America, you have lots of allies who are standing up with you, and we are demanding police reform because America is better than this.

Compounding his racism, Trump has made comments making his contempt for due process known. He supports mass incarceration at a time when there is bipartisan support to dismantle it, supports militarization of the police departments, and supports stop-and frisk. This sets the stage for more and more Tulsas, Charlottes, Charlestons, Clevelands, New Yorks, Milwaukees, Baltimores, St. Pauls, Chicagos, and Fergusons. More protests, more riots, until perhaps there is no one left to protest. If that sounds like an exaggeration, consider that one in four US women already has a relative currently in prison, the vast majority of whom are people of color.

Sadly, the FOP’s endorsement denigrates those good cops who bravely put their lives on the line everyday to do the right thing, and those cops who want to improve their profession and support police reform.

Police reform is a national emergency that needs to be addressed before it continues to tear our nation apart. Clearly there is something wrong with the way police officers are trained. “Warrior policing” is emphasized instead of de-escalation techniques, and cops are not taught enough how to recognize their own implicit biases and check them (biases all of us Americans hold, myself included). America imprisons more people per capita than every other country in the world. We hold 25% of the world’s prison population, even though we don’t even have anywhere near the high crime rates.

It saddens me that instead of trying to improve the way policing is done, rebuilding trust with the communities they are sworn to protect and serve, we see police departments dig in their heels to fight police reform at the expense of people’s lives and our nation’s unity.

Seared into our collective consciousness is the image of hundreds of cops turning their backs on New York Mayor Bill deBlasio in January 2015 as he delivered a moving eulogy for a slain police officer. Why? Because deBlasio had previously questioned the department’s racially discriminatory stop-and-frisk policy and publicly admitted that he had had “The Talk” with his black teenage son—the same talk ubiquitous in households of black boys —- about how to survive an encounter with the police.

Yes, these truths make police and many white people uncomfortable. But we, as a nation, cannot turn our backs. We must rise above, do the hard work of truth and reconciliation, examine our own implicit biases, and heal our wounds. We must become a nation that is genuinely a place of Liberty and Justice For All. We are better than this."
100037,1003,An Economy that Grows Anger,http://www.huffingtonpost.com/paul-j-croce/an-economy-that-grows-ang_b_12173172.html?utm_hp_ref=politics,2,"This election season has revealed a lot of anger in the electorate directed against establishment thinking and establishment figures in each party. Ted Cruz defied the Republican establishment for not living up to traditional values. Donald Trump continues to defy the Republican establishment for not being tough enough on immigration and trade deals. Bernie Sanders still calls for a revolution against the establishments in both parties for not standing up to corporate interests. Hillary Clinton is in the unenviable position of defending the status quo with credentials as an adept institutional player. She is the Washington insider standing against the anti-establishment storm.
And then there were two. The home stretch pits Trump and Clinton against each other with each summoning the highest disapproval ratings of any major party candidates in history. More anger, now about the choices, with many voters lining up against Clinton on trustworthiness and against Trump on character. Our current political scene operates with a Hollywood-type “anger management” approach to outbursts of anger. While Trump hopes to ride the wave of anger to victory, Clinton presents the calm alternative, with promises to manage the maddening issues. It’s a campaign between Stoking the Outrage and The Empathy of the Well-Connected.
Meanwhile, there is little attention to why so many people are angry in a country that seems to have so much going for it. The US enjoys almost unrivaled general prosperity compared to most nations; the unemployment rate is relatively low; inflation has been moderate on average. But this portrait from numbers belies lurking structural problems. 
The economy provides abundant ways for the wealthy to become wealthier, while the working class hangs on with frequent underemployment and many citizens too discouraged to enter the statistical count of joblessness. The bipartisan anger against Wells Fargo CEO John Stumpf showed the depth of outrage over the sense of entitlement among the rich and powerful. Entry into the cutting-edge of the economy requires years of education, which is becoming so expensive that it reinforces the feeling that it takes money (or enormous debt) to make money. And the relatively low retail prices that consumers do enjoy often come with outsourced jobs, which bring short-term price gains but long-term community erosion; meanwhile, prices on things that cannot be outsources, not just education, but also housing and health care, continued increase dramatically. 
The anger emerges less from outbursts over immediate suffering than from perceptions that opportunities are slipping away. The reason for the low candidate approval ratings is that this looks like an election between a sensible and well-informed Democrat defending a crazy system and a sometimes crazy-sounding Republican who brashly calls for changes as yet undisclosed. 
Beneath all these structural issues is a commitment to constant growth, growth that cannot be sustained in the long run without some new smart choices. In the face of consensus over extravagant growth, the candidates are caught in a wrestling match over claims to the best ways to achieve great growth; and they spend even more time pointing out the faults that keep their constituency from getting its piece of the growth pie. 
They are like crabs in an unsustainable boiling pot with each one trying to stop the other one from getting out using its favored path. But each way out has to go through the boil: the values path blames the nation’s straying from traditional morality; the toughness path blames leaders for not being aggressive enough in staking America’s claim to supremacy; progressives blame corporations for seizing more power even as citizens crave their goods; mainstream Republicans blame the government for inhibiting the ability of business to prosper even if at the expense of natural or community well-being. 
Meanwhile, the pot of constant growth keeps boiling away, with more growth the sole measure of a better life. Some growth is good, but as with anything, it has its excesses. The goal should be healthy growth. In the language of economics, growth is healthy as long as the benefits exceed the costs, but when the generation of goods and services becomes massive, the costs far outstrip the benefits. So excessive growth can be unhealthy. In fact, in medicine, it’s called cancer.
We now have parties that agree on extravagant growth and agree to overlook its major problems. Clinton calls for taxes and laws to pay for programs that will stimulate growth in domestic jobs and maintain protections for workers. Trump suggests that a wall keeping out Mexican immigrants and his tough negotiations on trade deals will make the economy “great again.” Meanwhile, constant growth will deliver its paybacks in the cost of government programs coping with its side effects, the pressure on companies to engage in harmful practices to keep profits flowing, and the tendencies to extract prosperity from powerless people or landscapes. 
If we didn’t crave as much growth, there would be little need for the candidates’ policy proposals to cope with its problems. Politics could turn to its prime goal of stimulating creativity and cooperation to sustain well-being and prevent assaults on its health. The pioneer economic theorist John Stuart Mill observed that with less growth, there would be “as much room for improving the Art of Living and much more likelihood of its being improved.”
A media celebrity recently said, “being paid more than you’re actually worth is the American Dream.” That’s an expression from the high wave of extravagant growth, and when expressed by a celebrity, it shows our aspirations. This outlook sets a model for all of us smaller fry to try to live up to that overabundant standard. And there is plenty of media attention to stars whose commodity is fame and who circulate in a whole different economy of luxury and privilege. 
The nation’s first Republican President presented a different picture of the American Dream based on getting an honest day’s pay for an honest day’s work. Abraham Lincoln recognized that people will rise and fall to different stations in life, but those differences in status should emerge, he hoped, based on equal opportunity and individual merit rather than special privilege. This vision of democratic social life requires a government that insures fair play for all, and it calls for individuals to bring ingenuity and planning to their efforts to make their own living or become economic players in their communities or beyond. 
Lincoln expressed this vision at a time when many other Americans sought to achieve the American Dream by extracting their income from the work of others. While Lincoln presented a model for healthy growth, slaveholders sought unhealthy growth through slavery. Today, media celebrity is promoting unhealthy growth through extravagance. 
Americans agree that the presidential choices are not perfect, but in that contest as in the down-ticket races, citizens would do well to support candidates who support the health of the economy and society, not just constant growth.

100038,1004,Gennifer Flowers Agrees To Join Trump At First Presidential Debate,http://talkingpointsmemo.com/livewire/trump-gennifer-flowers-at-debate-mark-cuban/,2,"After Hillary Clinton's campaign seated notorious Donald Trump troll Mark Cuban in the front row of the first presidential debate, Trump fired back by threatening to invite Gennifer Flowers, who accepted.

""If dopey Mark Cuban of failed Benefactor fame wants to sit in the front row, perhaps I will put Jennifer (sic) Flowers right alongside of him!"" the GOP nominee tweeted Saturday.

Shortly afterwards, Trump deleted the tweet and posted one with the correct spelling of Flowers' name. An assistant to Flowers later confirmed to BuzzFeed News that she accepted Trump's invitation.

""Ms. Flowers has agreed to join Donald at the debate,"" she said.

On Friday, Cuban announced that he had front row seats to the debate and made it clear that he was rooting for Clinton. Cuban declared that he was ready to see a ""humbling at Hofstra"" University, where the debate will be held. An anonymous aide later told CNN that the Clinton campaign was behind getting Cuban the ticket, saying: ""He has the best seat we have access to.""

Cuban, rumored in June to be one of the names on Trump's list of vice presidential picks, is also the leading skeptic when it comes to the GOP nominee's claims about his wealth.

Earlier in September, Cuban offered to donate $10 million to a charity of Trump's choice—or to Trump himself—to conduct an interview about policy during which the GOP nominee would not be allowed to mention the Clintons.

A Trump campaign ad released on Tuesday drew on archival footage of the Clintons being interviewed about Flowers, featuring a shot from the 1992 episode of ""60 Minutes"" where Bill Clinton denied having an extramarital affair with Flowers. Years later, Clinton acknowledged that he had a sexual encounter with her."
100039,1004,New York Times Endorses Hillary Clinton For President,http://talkingpointsmemo.com/livewire/new-york-times-endorses-clinton,2,"The New York Times' editorial board endorsed Hillary Clinton for president on Saturday.

""Our endorsement is rooted in respect for her intellect, experience, toughness and courage over a career of almost continuous public service, often as the first or only woman in the arena,"" the Times wrote.

The editorial board slammed Trump as a candidate who ""discloses nothing concrete about himself or his plans while promising the moon and offering the stars on layaway,"" in contrast to Clinton, who the board cited as having ""a record of service and a raft of pragmatic ideas.""

Calling Clinton ""one of the most tenacious politicians of her generation,"" the Times cited her positions on women's rights, immigration reform, and foreign relations as examples of her experience.

""Americans born since 9/11 have had to grow up fast, and they deserve a grown-up president,"" the board concluded. ""A lifetime’s commitment to solving problems in the real world qualifies Hillary Clinton for this job."""
100040,1004,Clinton Postpones Trip To Charlotte,http://talkingpointsmemo.com/livewire/clinton-trump-postpone-trips-to-charlotte/,2,"In a statement released Friday evening, Hillary Clinton's campaign announced that the Democratic nominee is postponing a visit to Charlotte, North Carolina, originally scheduled for Sunday.

""We have decided to postpone Sunday's trip as not to impact the City's resources,"" communications director Jennifer Palmieri wrote in the statement. ""She will plan to visit Charlotte next Sunday.""

 Two officials from Donald Trump's campaign told CNN late Friday that they were no longer planning to visit Charlotte next week after the first presidential debate.

This didn't stop the GOP nominee from taking to Twitter the same day to criticize Clinton for the announcement, although he incorrectly identified the date the Clinton campaign originally named for the visit: In an interview with CNN anchor Erin Burnett earlier Friday, Charlotte Mayor Jennifer Roberts (D) asked both candidates to delay plans to visit the city.

""I would encourage them to come at a later date. We really appreciate their support,"" Roberts said. ""We hope that they could figure a way to come a little bit later.""

Protestors took to the streets in Charlotte on Friday for the fourth straight night of protests over the fatal police shooting of Keith Lamont Scott on Tuesday afternoon.

A suspect was arrested Friday morning in connection with the fatal shooting of Justin Carr, a protestor who was shot on Wednesday night when protests turned violent and later died of his injuries, according to police.

100041,1006,Cruz: I have forgiven Trump for his personal attacks,http://hotair.com/archives/2016/09/24/cruz-forgiven-trump-personal-attacks/,2,"Did Ted Cruz betray the conservative movement, or just engage in some realpolitik in order to keep it from being completely eclipsed for the next four years? KTRK’s Tom Abrahams got an exclusive interview with the Republican presidential runner-up after Cruz’ endorsement of Donald Trump to get an explanation. Cruz says he’s put aside personal insults directed toward his family to focus on the good of the country, but that may be a tough sell among those who considered him a leader in the GOP’s resistance to Trump.

First question — did Cruz get any concessions out of his switch? Nope, Cruz tells Abrahams (via The Blaze): “There were no deals,” he said. “We had been engaged in conversations. You know it’s been a decision as I said I’ve been thinking about and praying about for weeks and months, discussing it with my family, and I made the decision today and announced it Friday. …

“Listen,” he said. “(In) politics, there’s always criticism. If no one is throwing rocks at you, you’re not doing much of anything. I’ve discussed it with both Heidi (Cruz) and my dad. I love my wife. I love my dad. Both of them have forgiven Donald. I have forgiven him. This is not personal. This is not about our family. It’s about the country. ” …

“We have [two] choices,” he said. “We have Hillary or Donald. Now when this race started I had another choice in mind. I campaigned very hard. Tried to make that case. Out of 17 republican candidates, we beat 15 of them, but we didn’t beat 16 of them and at this point Donald is the republican nominee. At this point it is a choice, a binary choice between Donald Trump and Hillary Clinton and my conscience leads me to conclude that a Hillary Clinton presidency would do enormous damage to the court, to the bill of rights, to the constitution, to our freedom, to our jobs. And that’s why I am going to be voting for the Republican nominee.” The problem with all of these calculations, at least for those who trusted Cruz, is that all of these calculations existed in May, and in July at the convention, too. Trump has never apologized for the personal insults, which even Cruz acknowledges doesn’t justify sitting on his hands, but also hasn’t exactly embraced the conservative policy agenda. (See Allahpundit’s post yesterday for more on that.) The only changes that could have prompted this are that Trump has re-emphasized his Supreme Court picks and now included Mike Lee as a potential selection (which Lee has already rejected), and that Trump has become a competitive candidate.

It’s the latter that’s probably playing most into this calculation. As long as Trump was doomed to lose in a landslide, it behooved Cruz to keep his distance, making himself pristine — well, mostly pristine, if people ignore the months-long schmoozing between Cruz and Trump during the primaries — for après Trump le deluge. If it becomes a close race and Cruz didn’t participate in helping to defeat Hillary Clinton, then suddenly the post-Trump field looks a lot different. Nor is Cruz alone in this calculation, which is why his endorsement sent shock waves through the NeverTrump movement. The rest of the significant anti-Trump Republicans had Cruz as a kind of shield, but now that he’s put the personal insults aside and endorsed Trump, they’re going to face a lot more pressure to get over their ideological opposition and act pragmatically.

That is, of course, highly ironic — since pragmatic conservatism is exactly what cost some of the other Republican presidential hopefuls their shot at the nomination. Maybe pragmatism will make a comeback in the 2020 cycle, but that won’t help the iconoclastic ideologue Cruz much if it does. It’s a double act against interests.

Chris Cillizza gave Cruz his “Worst Week in Washington” award for the Friday afternoon endorsement dump: Cruz is no dummy and had to know, given his checkered history with Trump, that an endorsement of the Republican nominee might not sit well with lots and lots of Republicans. For Cruz, the gamble is that by publicly declaring both his support for and doubts about Trump, he can please both the most loyal supporters of the nominee and the #NeverTrump movement — thus preserving his viability as a presidential candidate in 2020 or 2024.

Maaaaaybe. In truth, Cruz had backed himself into a corner; on one side were his attacks on Trump and on the other stood his ambition to run for president again. And everyone knows that when you are backed into a corner you roll over and play dead. Wait, no. But you get the idea.

Cruz, for endorsing a candidate you clearly loathe (and who clearly loathes you), you had the Worst Week in Washington. Congrats, or something.
To quote Cillizza … maaaaaybe. Four years is a long time in politics. Cruz has two years to rebound enough to get re-elected to the Senate, and then we can see whether he’s learned anything from the body blows he took in this cycle. Don’t count him out yet.

Update: Jeff’s taking the glass-nearly-empty approach: Inconceivable! On the other hand, Cruz did end up throwing in the towel without much to show for it, so …"
100042,1006,RNC: We feel like we have a solid ground game operation for Trump,http://hotair.com/archives/2016/09/24/rnc-we-feel-like-we-have-a-solid-ground-game-operation-for-trump/,2,"We’ve all seen the headlines plastered across the news media. Where’s the ground game? Donald Trump’s ground game has been reported wn be mostly non-existent, with rather disconcerting reports of a 12-year-old pretty much running operations in Jefferson County, Colorado—a key county in the state—and the Trump campaign having only one field office in all of Florida. Trump needs to win both Florida and Ohio to get to 270. While the polls have been tightening, with some showing the Republican nominee ahead of Hillary Clinton in the states that he needs to win, there’s a question about turnout. With what seems to be skeleton crews running these operations, there is a feeling of unease—and rightfully so. Yet, Townhall spoke with senior officials at the Republican National Committee about the 2016 ground game operation—to show that it’s actually quite a robust machine that’s been getting ready for this election for the past three years.

In 2015, there was a strong internal review at the RNC about laying the groundwork for the 2016 election. The RNC’s machinery did very well in 2014, with the GOP retaking the Senate, nabbing two-thirds of the governorships, 66/99 state legislatures, and the most elected state lawmakers since 1920. Oh, and the largest House majority since Herbert Hoover. This is just abject slaughter, with donkeys littered everywhere across a wide swath of races ranging from state house representative to U.S. Senator. This is another key component to their ground operation, but let’s take a 30,000-foot view first.

Here’s what the two RNC officials told us. They knew that by 2016, a change needed to happen. Post-2012, the same ground game that Republicans have deployed in the past was dead; that plan aptly described by conservative commentator George Will as winning the South, the Midwest, the West, and spending the equivalent of the GDP of Brazil to win Ohio. Obama changed all that.

Another senior official worked for Romney in Nevada in 2012, and saw the effectiveness of what the president did through community organizing in his re-elect effort. They did a deep-dive into what Organizing for Action did, combed through old manuals, and even perused old blog posts from the Obama team that dated back to his 2008 campaign to essentially try and reach parity with the Democrats in their ground game operations. It’s not that Republicans were bad, it’s that they let the 2004 Bush re-elect remain static, which in turn let that apparatus atrophy with time. It goes back to the old axiom of American politics: there are no permanent victories. So, they went back into the basics.

Voter Registration – the RNC wanted to revitalize their voter registration efforts since you can put states on the map and take states off.
Persuasion – We all have debated endlessly about how the GOP has a messaging problem. The 2012 election made that explicitly clear. There was no room for more Todd Akins blowing up the spot. In short, the GOP knew they had to change the way they talked and approached voters. One of the things they’ve done is shift away from phone calls. In the past the RNC used to have massive phone banks, where legions of volunteers would make as many calls as possible. With landlines becoming more obsolete, it’s harder to reach voters, so they shifted 90 percent of their voter outreach to door knocking and utilizing community organizing practices. About 95 percent of the data obtained through neighborhood canvassing is gathered through digital walk apps; they’ve ditched the clipboards. With most of their data is being obtained on smart phones, the RNC now has the ability to get a sense of what is driving voter conversations on the ground and rapidly retool any messaging needed to be more effective in outreach. Also, ditching paper means that _ of the staff doesn’t have to take time analyzing the sheets and entering the data, cannibalizing the most precious resource in politics: time.
Turnout – Democrats walk with swagger over their turnout operations, but the Republican Party is just as good. You need to look no further than the midterm elections to see the results. The problem for national years is that the GOP didn’t juice up their voter registration efforts and they didn’t really take the time to get to know the voters in the areas that decide elections. It was sort of like a carnival mindset. The D.C. operative would arrive, set up victory offices, and then leave. There was no projection from the national party that they cherished and valued every vote and the local activists who helped them in the various communities that dot the country. These are the people who know how to win in these areas, they now the point of the lance in these efforts. Concerning doors, the RNC said their numbers have dwarfed what they did in 2012. As for registration, there are scores of new Republicans. There has been a massive spike in the August numbers, and they’ve seen increases for each succeeding week since then.
Wait—aren’t voter registration drives a massive waste of time? I mean, these people weren’t registered to vote in the first place; what makes you think they’ll be reliable voters in November. These people simply don’t care. Well, that’s not necessarily true.

The RNC noted that research shows that a newly registered Republican will vote 70-75 percent of the time. They also view it within the paradigm of the selective service. Moreover, we’re a country that moves constantly. Voter registration drives allow transplanted active Republican voters to re-register, re-enroll, and cast their ballot for the party come Election Day.

Another senior official chimed in to say that they saw the value in voter registration with Obama’s efforts in 2012. Yet, what about the spike in GOP registration—aren’t these just conservative Reagan Democrats who have been voting Republican for years who are now changing their voter registration?

Both senior officials added that Donald Trump brings a whole other level of enthusiasm, which we all saw during the primaries. That enthusiasm has driven a new pool of voters that have registered who might have sat out in the past few cycles, though they did admit that there are Democrats who have voted Republican, like in Western Pennsylvania, that have decided to switch party affiliations. Yet, the numbers are weighed more towards new voters.

So, what about the campaign office issue? Well, it turns out that it might not matter all that much—and they’re certainly not worried about it. It’s all about reaching voters and offices don’t do that. Second, offices usually involve phone banking, which the RNC has actively moved away from this cycle. In the end, it would be a waste of money. This year, the GOP is looking for places where Americans congregate, like public libraries, churches, and high schools, while using the local infrastructure to build upon the inroads created by the local parties. To them, the Clinton campaign seems to be running a very 2004-based campaign strategy with their emphasis on field offices. Yet, the notion of building on the existing local party network, the investment in people, and reaching those people personally is the focus of this multi-year project.

One thing they did admit was that they often got on the ground way too late. The old plan was to run a six-month spring to the finish. With Clinton, that team seems to be following the same format, one of the officials said that a million man-hours went by before Team Hillary began assembling their ground operation. The GOP has been on the ground since 2013—and they haven’t left.

Concerning the early voting strategy, all eyes are on North Carolina for now. The ballots have gone out, with the data operation and the field operation. The RNC claims that their crew in the Tar Heel State has been collecting absentee request forms at rallies and through door knocks, especially when it comes to low propensity Trump supporters. They started collecting these requests this summer (when legal), as well as Florida, which has been going strong. It came back to a discussion about getting the data.

Since 2013, the data-collecting wing of the RNC’s operation needed a revamp, they had a test program that would apply individual voter scores and saw success. They rolled it out in early 2014 and were used to get updated voter information throughout the summer for that cycle’s’ senate races. It gauged a voter score based on 0-100 concerning turnout, voting tendencies (do they lean Republican, Democratic, or veer towards the Independent camp), and who they are likely to support.

The RNC officials said that they update the database frequently during the 2014 midterms. A test to the accuracy of this system came with the North Carolina Senate race between Republican challenger Thom Tillis and incumbent Democratic Sen. Kay Hagan. They projected that Tillis would win by a margin of 1.3 percent; he ended up winning by 1.5 percent. At the time, the RNC stuck their necks out and assured the now-senator that he would win his election, which did happen. From 2014 onward, this database has been built upon ever since.

In July of 2015, the RNC gave itself a baseline, set their voter scores, and went about calibrating their voter database to have the best information to take on the Clinton machine. By December 2015-January of 2016, the decision was made to refresh it monthly, compile and find trends in the data throughout February, March, and April—pretty much up until now. These folks are feeling pretty good about the insight they have regarding he likelihood of turnout and support for Trump. Each month allows the RNC to better gauge their voting universe pre-Election Day

They added that each time they do an update; they get a projected snapshot and a clear picture of where the race is right now. More importantly, they know exactly where their voter deficits are pre-Election Day. It also shows gives them a target area for where absentee ballot requests can be made and where they should go.

With individuals that are less likely to turnout to vote, this database allows the field teams to find them. As for the current projections, RNC officials say that the direction looks good, with a lot of their findings matching what’s being reported in the latest string of public polling. Is their model also finding secret Trump voters? Yes—with 3.7 billion voter projections each month that takes into account the support level for presidential, Senate, and congressional named ballots. I think the Trump campaign is overestimating the size of this silent voting bloc, but they exist. And they’re large enough to scare Democratic pollsters, who have a feeling that voters in their own samples are lying to them about their support for Clinton. Hey, this whole cycle has been dotted by extreme volatility, yet the RNC’s 1,100 staff spread throughout the country seem confident that they have their ground game operation in a good place to help their entire slate come November. Let’s see if their projections are just as accurate as the ones they gave Tillis and the rest of the GOP slate in 2014."
100043,1006,Obama used pseudonym to e-mail Hillary on secret server,http://hotair.com/archives/2016/09/24/obama-used-pseudonym-e-mail-hillary-secret-server/,2,"Remember when Barack Obama professed ignorance of Hillary Clinton’s use of a secret e-mail system during her tenure as Secretary of State? The President could not have been more unequivocal last October, when he told 60 Minutes reporter Steve Kroft that he had no knowledge of it at all: KROFT: Did you know about Hillary Clinton’s use of private… private email server —

OBAMA: No.

KROFT: — while she was secretary of state?

OBAMA: No. Like most Obama statements, this one came with an expiration date. New releases from the FBI investigation show that Obama communicated with Hillary over her clintonemail.com server, clearly making his statement to Kroft a lie. In fact, it even surprised Huma Abedin, who wondered aloud when the FBI asked about it how those communications couldn’t have been classified: President Barack Obama used a pseudonym in email communications with Hillary Clinton and others, according to FBI records made public Friday. …

In an April 5, 2016 interview with the FBI, Abedin was shown an email exchange between Clinton and Obama, but the longtime Clinton aide did not recognize the name of the sender.

“Once informed that the sender’s name is believed to be pseudonym used by the president, Abedin exclaimed: ‘How is this not classified?'” the report says. “Abedin then expressed her amazement at the president’s use of a pseudonym and asked if she could have a copy of the email.”
The White House has tried to keep its distance from the scandal, but this might make that a little more difficult. It’s clear that the FBI has tried to help out in that regard, too. This came out late yesterday, long after the Friday news cycle had closed. It’s the second Friday-night document dump in a row for the FBI in this investigation, making their political aim clear — to minimize this as much as possible.

The FBI and the White House have a lot of explaining to do now, but don’t expect them to do it willingly. Obama will no doubt waste little time in invoking executive privilege when Congress starts demanding answers, perhaps with some justification — as it pertains to the content of the communications. Their very existence, however, shows that Obama offered bald-faced lies on national television to Kroft and to voters, and that’s not covered by executive privilege.

Update: Did Hillary use a State Department account for a back-up? No, she used Gmail:

Hillary Clinton created a previously undisclosed email account to communicate when her private server system was down, documents made public by the FBI Friday show.

Monica Hanley, a former Clinton aide, told FBI investigators that Clinton likely created the second private account — a “gmail.com” address — to send messages when her server crashed in 2011 during a trip to Croatia.

An FBI report made public earlier this month showed Clinton and her staff had been warned repeatedly about using private accounts while overseas. What’s more, Clinton and her staff have repeatedly said the former secretary of state used just one personal address.
It’s amazing that the FBI managed to expose so many of the claims from Hillary and the White House as drizzly effluvium … and yet still found no intent to break the law. Hmmmmm."

She’s a crazy, crazy, crazy lefty.

And if Hillary Clinton wins in November, Warren will be influential in deciding who is part of grandma’s cabinet – and I’m not talking about Capt. Morgan.

Yikes. From Heat Street:

When Elizabeth Warren agreed to serve as one of Hillary Clinton’s primary surrogates, it left some progressives scratching their heads. After all, what could Elizabeth Warren, whose policies more closely align with Bernie Sanders’s than the designated nominee’s, get out of a Hillary Clinton alliance? It turns out that Elizabeth Warren’s deal with the Clinton campaign gives her more control than progressives could have reasonably expected.

According to the Wall Street Journal, Warren has been working overtime behind the scenes, using her alliances with left-leaning special interest groups and non-profits to scout out potential progressive new hires for a Clinton administration. In a recent speech to the Center for American Progress, she touted her plan to make sure no Wall Street cronies or moderate Democrats get key assignments. “When we talk about personnel, we don’t mean advisers who just pay lip service to Hillary’s bold agenda, coupled with a sigh, a knowing glance, and the twiddling of thumbs until it’s time for the next swing through the revolving door, serving government and then going back to the very same industries they regulate,” she said. I think ol’ Cherokee Liz is going to find out that she wasted a lot of time.

Hillary is poised to lose.

People associated with her campaign are even bigger losers for supporting a woman they know would be bad for the nation."

100046,1007,Multiple Cases of Deceased Men and Women Found Voting in Colorado,http://www.youngcons.com/multiple-cases-of-deceased-men-and-women-found-voting-in-colorado/,2,"“Anything 4 Power.”

Forget catchy presidential slogans.

That should just be the sole slogan allowable for all politicians running for office – at any level.

How do dead people wind up voting years after they have died in every election, yet Democrats still do everything they can to make it seem like voter fraud rarely occurs?

SMH.

From CBS Denver: DENVER (CBS4) – A CBS4 investigation has found multiple cases of dead men and women voting in Colorado months and in some cases years after their deaths, a revelation that calls into question safeguards designed to prevent such occurrences.

“We do believe there were several instances of potential vote fraud that occurred,” said Colorado Secretary of State Wayne Williams after reviewing the CBS4 findings. “It shows there is the potential for fraud.” The cases of dead men and women casting ballots ranged from El Paso County in southern Colorado to Denver and Jefferson County. CBS4 discovered the fraudulent voting by comparing databases of voting histories in Colorado against a federal death database.

The CBS4 investigation has triggered criminal investigations in El Paso and Jefferson counties along with a broad investigation by the Colorado Secretary of State’s office. “It’s not a perfect system. There are some gaps,” acknowledged Williams.

One of the most glaring cases was that of Sara Sosa in Colorado Springs. She died on Oct. 14, 2009. However, CBS4 uncovered voting records that showed ballots cast for Sosa in 2010, 2011, 2012 and 2013. Her husband, Miguel, died on Sept. 26, 2008. But CBS4 unearthed records showing that a vote was cast in his name the next year, 2009.

“That’s illegal,” said El Paso County Clerk and Recorder Chuck Broerman, who called the CBS4 findings “very serious.”

“I was shocked and surprised at this,” said Broerman. “This cannot happen. We cannot have this here or anyplace in our country. Our democracy depends on it. People have spilled their blood for the values and underpinnings and beliefs of this country.” Since Colorado is a very liberal state, wouldn’t you be interested in knowing who the deceased are voting for?

I know I am.

What are the odds all signs point to Democrats?

Here’s your answer… "
100047,1008,"Two Candidates, One Shot at Turning the Economy and the Nation",http://www.americanthinker.com/articles/2016/09/two_candidates_one_shot_at_turning_the_economy_and_the_nation.html,2,"When thinking about critical issues defining this November’s presidential election, most Americans identify foreign policy concerns, growing Islamist terror threats, and Supreme Court appointments as being the high stakes issues. And while most consider jobs and the economy equally important, very few realize just how precarious the U.S. financial condition really is. 

In a recent campaign speech, Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump stated that Fed chief Janet Yellen should be “ashamed of herself for what she was doing to Americans” and for creating a “false stock market.” As has so often been the case, Trump’s direct manner of speaking brought on immediate criticism by the establishment and its surrogates in the media. But Trump was factually correct about his charge that the economy has been distorted by the Fed’s Zero Interest Rate Policy (ZIRP), which has penalized savers, encouraged debt expansion, and driven the stock market to an artificially high level. In addition to ZIRP, the Fed’s money printing and bond-buying programs carried out during the last seven and a half years have served to bail out and mask President Obama’s failed economic policies. 

A zero interest rate policy not only can’t promote wealth creation, it impedes it by distorting the pricing of credit and creating uncertainty that dampens economic activity. The result has been the somewhat arbitrary and unnatural shifting around of wealth, penalizing savers and rewarding debtors -- such as companies who borrow to fund stock buybacks to raise the per share earnings and the stock price, rather than borrowing to finance business expansion and new jobs.

The world’s biggest borrower is the U.S. government, which on Obama’s watch has borrowed to finance deficits averaging $913 billion annually. To grasp the extent of America’s present dire financial condition, just consider that during all the years leading up to 2008, the highest single year U.S. deficit was $459 billion, about half of the annual average deficit during the nearly eight years of Obama rule. Among G20 countries, the U.S. debt to GDP is now 104.5% -- the third worst, exceeded only by Italy and Japan. By the time he leaves office, Obama will have presided over a government that added just about as much debt in eight years as was accumulated in the first 225 years of U.S. history.

The shame of the Federal Reserve goes far beyond artificially elevating the stock market, bailing out a Democratic president presiding over the worst economic recovery since the Great Depression, and paving the way for his successor, Hillary Clinton, to get elected. It goes to the heart of what ails the country: the inability of the governing elite class to address honestly the facts about economic reality, and in particular to explain the nation’s insolvency trajectory and consequential collapse -- a catastrophe that would dwarf the previous financial crisis of 2008 and all prior recessions and depressions.

Neither governments nor central banks create or add to national wealth because they don’t produce much of anything of substance that people willingly pay for -- with the exception of a very few categories, such as national defense, which drives military contractor output. Almost all the wealth, encapsulated in the nearly $4 trillion annual national budget administered by the U.S. federal government is obtained from taxing productive people and private sector companies or by issuing debt and borrowing money.

Since U.S. GDP has historically grown about 3.25 to 3.5 percent annually, the anemic sub-1.75 percent average annual growth during nearly eight years of Obama demonstrates the simple fact that government has been more the problem than the solution to what ails the economy.

The Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, commonly called ObamaCare, and the Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act, commonly called Dodd-Frank, were the two showcase pieces of legislation in the first Obama term (that advanced the socialization of nearly 30% of U.S. GDP manifest in the health care and financial service sectors of the economy). Both introduced enormously costly distortions to the economy, while failing to solve the problems that they purported to address. Health care costs have skyrocketed, government-run insurance exchanges have failed and many companies won’t grow their full-time employee headcount beyond 50 to avoid costs imposed by ObamaCare. Banks have consolidated, raised fees to the consumer, while the largest are bigger than ever, and certainly too big to fail.

The politically correct war against fossil fuels and pipelines to safely transport oil and gas has hurt the U.S. economy in other significant ways, both in job creation and the opportunity cost of deferred energy independence, lost exports and a diminished trade deficit. 

The dramatic increases in regulation by unelected and unaccountable government bureaucrats now saddle the U.S. economy with an annual cost burden of some $2 trillion. When this regulatory cost is added to the $3.9 trillion annual government expenditures, the actual cost of the federal government in the U.S. is closer to 33% of GDP rather than the 22% figure that is generally understood. Further, when costs of state and local taxes and regulatory requirements are cranked in, it becomes even more apparent that subpar growth will likely continue and become as permanent a feature in the U.S. as it has been in Japan and Europe for the last two and a half decades. That is of course, unless dramatic changes are undertaken. 

Looking under the hoods of the presidential candidates’ respective economic platforms makes it clear that Donald Trump understands what makes for job creation and economic growth. Hillary Clinton is at best a status quo, if morally challenged, tax and spend politician who lacks an appreciation of incentives for economic growth. She is also beholden to globalists and open borders advocates such as George Soros.

The key points of Clinton’s “National Infrastructure Plan” which are integral to her stated economic growth platform start with an $80 billion program of new spending and redistribution of wealth in three areas with no certainty of measurable job creation. Additionally, she calls for bailing out $35 billion in student loans annually and subsidizing states to guarantee tuition.

Clinton’s idea of growth is not about allowing markets to set prices, but rather expanding price controls, both in healthcare and throughout the economy in labor costs. Her stated intentions to continue the war against coal and raise the national minimum wage to $15/hour are but two policies that will put a lot of people out of work.

Her tax policies add new complexity and compliance costs. They are also all punitive -- such as raising estate taxes and imposing an “exit” tax on any company undertaking an “inversion” to reduce the burden of the 35% U.S. corporate tax rate -- the highest corporate tax rate in the world -- which is what drives inversions to begin with, and which Clinton leaves in place. That Clinton would maintain the least competitive corporate tax rate in the world reveals a conviction fundamentally at odds with job creation and economic growth.

Where the Clinton platform addresses regulation at all, it is about enlarging regulations, such as those pertaining to fracking and fossil fuel development, and expanding provisions in both ObamaCare and Dodd-Frank.

At best, under a Clinton presidency, the Obama path to national insolvency stays on course. At worst, and probably more likely, a Clinton presidency accelerates that trajectory for the simple reason that with heightened systemic risk from record debt accumulation, and with a growing amount of new debt being issued to service the old debt, the end game horizon approaches more rapidly. It’s a bit like making the minimum interest payments on maxed-out credit cards with money borrowed on yet another credit card. That doesn’t last very long.

In contrast, Donald Trump’s economic policy platform, would unleash dramatic new economic activity by cutting corporate taxes to 15%, and to 10% on repatriated funds earned by corporations overseas -- funds that have already been taxed by the countries in which those funds were earned.

Trump describes the cornerstone of his platform as “the biggest tax revolution since Reagan.” It focuses on tax simplification -- including the reduction of exemptions and in the number of tax brackets from 7 to 3, with rates reduced to 12, 25 and 33 percent. Trump would also eliminate the estate tax, noting that wealth in estates has already been taxed when earned, often at the highest rates. In short, Trump’s tax plans assure that more money stays in the private sector, which stimulates growth and drives new tax revenues. Trump’s tax policy advisors assert that the combination of economic growth from lower tax rate incentives and the elimination of deductions and loopholes will be revenue positive fairly quickly -- that is, bringing in more money to the federal treasury.

Just as significant as his tax policies are Trump’s positions on regulatory reform -- all of which are targeted at keeping jobs and wealth in America. He starts with repealing and replacing Obamacare. Next he sets his sites on dramatic GDP growth by lifting the restrictive regulations on all sources of American energy production.

In his recent Detroit address on domestic policy Trump pledged that he would “remove the anchor dragging us down,” by cancelling overreaching regulatory executive orders and issuing a temporary moratorium on new agency regulations. Further, all agency regulations that either do not improve public safety or needlessly kill jobs would be rescinded. Lifting even a fraction of a $2 trillion regulatory burden on the U.S. economy would catalyze significant new jobs and tax revenues.

In summary, Americans not only have to consider each candidates’ likely Supreme Court appointments, foreign policy positions, and resolve to defeat Islamist terrorism. Voters also need to understand the imperative of supporting the presidential candidate with new ideas and approaches to dramatically revitalize growth, job creation, and increase the tax base. This is the critical factor in changing the current trajectory toward insolvency and collapse.  

In the home stretch leading up to November 8, candidate Trump might even go further in targeting middle and lower middle class constituencies that are not overly ideological, but may have traditionally voted Democrat. A growing number of these people are likely to be open to the “Make America Great Again” message -- after eight years of shrinking wages and job prospects.

It may turn out that the pool of commonsense people likely to vote is larger than previously assumed. It isn’t that hard, after all, to understand why voting for economic growth is far less risky than continuing the path of codependence on a profligate and disingenuous government that couldn’t bail itself or anyone else out when the next debt bubble bursts.

100048,1008,How Trump Wins the Debates,http://www.americanthinker.com/articles/2016/09/how_trump_wins_the_debates.html,2,"Americans will be watching the presidential debates closely – not for policies or ideas, but for images and demeanor.  This creates a clear opening for Donald Trump.  Hillary has hidden behind flacks and party hacks and pandering and controlled media.  Trump has behaved exactly the opposite way, speaking for himself, attacking party machines, and acting often unscripted.

No one who watches the debates is really going to be interested in what Hillary says or does.  Even her supporters can turn on the mute button when she is answering questions.  In the last quarter-century, Hillary has never said anything new or original, and her strategy is to waddle behind the Obama presidency and hope no one pays much attention to her.

Everyone who watches the debates is going to be interested in Trump.  Is he going to say something outrageous?  Is he going to somehow “offend” some group?  Is he going to say something really dumb?  Clearly Hillary hopes so, but dreaming that Trump is dumb or does not understand media or cannot learn is a brainless strategy.

Trump has already learned how to command media attention while still doing really smart things like sharing the stage with Mexico’s president and visiting disaster scenes and going to blighted black areas with Dr. Carson – and, having supported police when they were clearly right, questioning what may be poor officer judgment in the Tulsa shooting.

Trump also is a much nicer person than he has been portrayed by the leftist establishment media.  People who actually know Trump like him, and when even your ex-wife has good things to say about you, that is saying quite a bit.  Donald Trump, comfortable in front of the camera, can and ought to protect a pleasant and relaxed persona during the debates.  He ought to recall that Ronald Reagan was smeared as an angry nut until Americans saw who he really was in the 1980 debates and came to really like who Reagan was as a person.

Hillary, of course, is as nasty and dishonest and spoiled as any political figure in American political history.  Not only is that image firmly fixed, but the image reflects reality.  Her screeching voice, her arrogant indifference to others, her crude lust for power, and every other unappealing aspect of her nature, which is to say every aspect of her nature, ooze from every pore.

Beyond all that, Hillary is clearly physically feeble, and if she has to sit down or if she wobbles on the stage or sweats like Nixon in 1960 or drinks too much water, then that will become the story of her appearance in the debates. 

Hillary is short, too.  People judge leaders by height even if they pretend not to do so.   Not only is the height difference between Trump and Hillary greater than between the major party presidential candidates in the last two hundred years, but Hillary, if elected, would be shorter than any president in more than two hundred years.  Moreover, in the era of television presidential politics, every president elected except Jimmy Carter was about six feet tall. 

If Hillary was elected, she would be the fattest president since William Howard Taft, the shortest president since James Madison, and the second oldest president in American history.  These very visible factors will quietly blend into the evaluation voters will make of her, whatever she says during the debates, especially as voters also try to figure out if she is really healthy or if she is lying about that, as she lies about almost everything.

Trump, in contrast, exudes energy and health, and while he is even older than Hillary and while he is chubby, too, the way he carries himself bespeaks a different sort of person from Mrs. William Jefferson Clinton. 

What all this means is that Hillary enters the debate with a profound optics problem, an inalterable appearance of meanness and dishonesty, and she will rely, almost entirely, upon staying on her plump, wobbly feet, mouthing dreary cant and waiting for Trump to do something stupid.  If he is smart (and he is smart), Trump will be confident, civil, strong, and clear...and if he does that, he will win.

100049,1008,Mainstream Conservatives and the Alt-Right,http://www.americanthinker.com/articles/2016/09/mainstream_conservatives_and_the_altright.html,2,"Recently, Jonah Goldberg and Hugh Hewitt debated how conservatives should respond to the rise of the so-called “alternative right.” The “alternative right,” is a disorganized movement centered on message boards, blogs, and social media. Based on their social media postings, blogs, and podcasts, it would be fair to call the alternative right a bigoted anti-Semitic movement.

If your favorite podcast is “The Daily Shoah,” and your favorite blog calls itself “The Daily Stormer,” it is a safe bet that you belong to a bigoted and anti-Semitic movement. There exist, as with any movement, alt-right moderates and alt-right fellow travelers, but the core of the movement is racist, anti-Semitic, and generally vile.

Those that dispute this characterization can look here for a fuller explanation.

If the alt-right were simply confined to people like David Duke and Andrew Anglin, it would be easy for normal conservatives to distance themselves from it. Unfortunately, there exists what could be called a “moderate alt-right,” along with a larger universe of fellow travelers, sympathizers, and panderers.

This broader universe of moderate alt-righters, sympathizers, and fellow travelers, has developed a fairly sophisticated critique of mainstream conservatism, a critique conservatives can ill afford to ignore.

Probably, the best articulation of this critique comes from Jared Taylor's “Open Letter to Cuckservatives.” In order to give readers a full and accurate understanding of Taylor's views, I have quoted what I see to be the key passages of his letter.

“American conservatism can conserve nothing if it cannot conserve the nation’s founding stock. I’ll put it bluntly: Nothing you love will survive without white people.”

“Do you stand for limited government and a balanced budget? Count your black and Hispanic allies. Do you admire Thomas Jefferson? He was a slave-holder who will end up on the dung heap with the Confederate flag. Do you care about stable families and the rights of the unborn? Look up illegitimacy, divorce, and abortion rates for blacks and Hispanics. Do you cherish the stillness at dawn in Bryce Canyon? When the park service manages to get blacks and Hispanics to go camping they play boom-boxes until 1:00 a.m. Was Ronald Reagan your hero? He would not win a majority of today’s electorate.”

“Outreach doesn’t work. You can’t talk someone into loving what you love. Faith, patriotism, duty, and honor come from deeply cultural, religious, and ancestral sources you can’t reach.”

“You tell yourself that the things you love about America -- and I love them, too -- are rooted in certain principles. That is your greatest mistake. They are rooted in certain people. That is why Germans, Swedes, Irishmen, and Hungarians could come and contribute to the America you love. Do you really believe that a future Afro-Hispanic-Caribbean-Asiatic America will be anything like the America your ancestors built?”

Fundamentally, Taylor believes that the America we know and love can only be maintained by people of European descent’

Jared Taylor is fundamentally wrong. As I will discuss later, American culture and American institutions can survive non-white immigration, but he isn't totally off track, and in order to properly respond to Taylor conservatives have to acknowledge what he gets right.

1. America is a branch of Anglo-European civilization. Our constitution emerged from a particular tradition, it was not derived from pure reason. Veneration of the founding fathers and the constitution must be tempered with a recognition that the values embodied in that document are not universally held around the world.

2. The relationship of an American to his nation is not purely contractual. Nations are held together by a shared sense of identity and patriotism, not simply by a set of laws.

3. Large scale immigration makes it more difficult to maintain a common identity, because it results in Americans having less in common.

4. Multiculturalism aggravates these problems by emphasizing, encouraging and celebrating these differences. Diversity is nice, but it needs to be balanced by the things that allow us to maintain a common identity.

Where Taylor goes wrong – very wrong, in fact – is in his unhealthy fixation on race. Taylor is correct that most of what we love about America was created by white people; he is wrong to believe that only white people can sustain American civilization.

Interestingly, Taylor’s hypothesis has already ben tested. In 1959, Congress admitted to the union a state that was overwhelmingly non-white. Has that state transformed into a third-world hell hole? A dictatorship? No.

By all measures Hawaii is doing pretty well. Hawaii's residents enjoy the eighth-highest median income of any state in the Union, according to 2014 figures. Meanwhile, West Virginia which is almost exclusively white has the second lowest median house hold income in the United States. If you believe the key to keeping America great is keeping America white, it's hard to explain why Hawaii is thriving and West Virginia is not.

Non-Hispanic whites compose roughly 40% of New Mexico's population, with the rest being a mixture of Hispanics and American Indians. New Mexico isn't rich, (43rd in median income), but it isn't a “third-world hell hole.”

A similar argument could be made for California, which has the third-highest median income.

None of this obligates America to accept immigrants from anywhere -- this author tends to sympathize with the moderate restrictionist position as articulated by people like Mark Krikorian -- but we also have no reason to panic, and lose hope for the future. Which is the message one gets from Jared Taylor.

The toxic combination of mass immigration and unbridled multiculturalism is bad for America, but it doesn't have to be fatal. A reduction in the raw numbers of immigrants along with an emphasis on a common American identity, will resolve many of our problems. If Anglo-American institution can survive on a pacific archipelago populated by Polynesians and East-Asians, they will survive the current wave of immigration.

Cruz for saying he “will vote for the Republican nominee, Donald Trump.”

The headline is stupid. Cruz’s tepid endorsement of Trump by no means suggests that he is “friends once more” with the obnoxious tycoon. Rather, as Cruz explained, though he has “areas of significant disagreement” with Trump, he cannot stand the idea of Hillary Clinton becoming president.

The NeverTrump crowd seems even more unhappy with Cruz than the Post. Didn’t Cruz say he’s “not in the habit of supporting people who attack my wife and attack my father”?

Yes he did. But Cruz finds the idea of a Hillary Clinton presidency unacceptable. Thus, he’s willing to vote to stop her even though it means voting. as he ordinarily wouldn’t do, for a candidate who insulted members of the Cruz family.

Cruz ought not be criticized for this reasonable decision. Indeed, it might be easier to criticize him if he let his anger over Trump’s insults to family members override his view that Hillary Clinton must not become president. However, I wouldn’t criticize Cruz either for voting for Trump or voting for neither candidate. Both options are defensible.

Cruz’s decision to announce that he’ll vote for Trump may well be based in part on an assessment of his political interests. Post reporter Katie Zezima reports that Cruz is under pressure form donors to back Trump and that the prospect of a primary challenge in 2018 may increase if he does not.

Cruz ought to be criticized for allowing political calculation to influence his decision to vote for Trump and his public announcement of that decision. Why shouldn’t Cruz — why shouldn’t any Republican — try to minimize the personal political fallout created because the GOP took (temporary?) leave of its senses and nominated Trump?

Will Cruz’s “endorsement” help Trump? I think so. Many conservatives are struggling, as Cruz was, to decide whether to vote for Trump. Many of those struggling have a high regard for Cruz. More than a few are likely to take their cue from the stalwart conservative Senator.

I believe it’s precisely because the endorsement helps Trump that both the Washington Post and the NeverTrumpers are so unhappy with Cruz’s decision."

The Washington Examiner spotted this hilarious item from an interview of a Platte River Networks employee who referred in 2014 to “the Hilary coverup operation.” The difference being, of course, that that was just a cartoon, while the Platte River email is reality. Somehow, though, the Washington Post doesn’t have the same enthusiasm for going after Hillary’s security breaches that it showed when it was bringing down a Republican president."
100052,1009,SCANDAL MANAGEMENT WITH THE FBI,http://www.powerlineblog.com/archives/2016/09/scandal-management-with-the-fbi.php,2,"Like everything touched by the Clintons, the FBI has now been compromised and slimed. We saw it in FBI Director James Comey’s absurd statement announcing Hillary Clinton’s get-out-of-jail-free pass. We saw it in the FBI’s holiday weekend document dump of 302 interviews in the case. We saw it again again late yesterday afternoon with more of the same.

These Friday afternoon document dumps come straight from the scandal management playbook perfected under the (Bill) Clinton administration. They remind us, in case any reminder was necessary, of how much we have to look forward to in the event the Clintons return to the White House. I nevertheless find it shocking that the FBI itself has now adopted the routine, acting as a party with much to be ashamed of.

With some 190 pages of interview notes to digest, the work isn’t done yet. Politico’s Josh Gerstein and Nolan McCaskill take a peek here. PJ Media’s Debra Heine cuts to the chase here.

Yesterday also brought the news that Cheryl Mills and at least four other participants in the investigation received limited immunity for coughing up evidence of one kind or another. Politico’s Gerstein and Nick Gass cover that revelation here.

National Review’s Andrew McCarthy is the man from whom I want to hear on the immunity. Andy served long and honorably as an Assistant United States Attorney in the office of the United States Attorney for the Southern District of New York. Indeed, in better days he served in that capacity alongside Comey. Prosecuting the blind sheikh for the 1993 World Trade Center bombing, Andy came away with the brilliant, still relevant memoir Willful Blindness.

Now Andy asks why Mills et al. were granted immunity. The first in a promised series of posts, it includes a long analysis that concludes with the damning if unsurprising observation: “It appears the Obama Justice Department’s goal was not to make a prosecutable case, but to make it appear that Hillary Clinton was ‘exonerated’ after a thorough FBI investigation.”

As I say, Clintons==>Corruption==>Slime. Comey and the FBI are just the latest and perhaps most enraging casualties."
100053,1001,Trump's outright lies in oneweek—31—a generous undercount,http://www.dailykos.com/stories/2016/9/25/1574103/-Trump-s-outright-lies-in-one-week-31-a-generous-undercount,3,"The New York Times has clearly turned a corner on its Donald Trump coverage, now fully embracing the word ""lie"" to describe the geyser of falsehoods that gush from him. Between Sept.15-21, its reporters counted what the paper called his ""Week of Whoppers"" and found 31 biggies. But that was clearly a generous undercount.

This total excludes dozens more: Untruths that appeared to be mere hyperbole or humor, or delivered purely for effect, or what could generously be called rounding errors. Mr. Trump’s campaign, which dismissed this compilation as “silly,” offered responses on every point, but in none of the following instances did the responses support his assertions.
Among the 31 that made the cut, Trump most frequently lied about his Iraq War position (five times) and mischaracterized Hillary Clinton's (and President Obama's) immigration policies (four times). Here's one example:

He said Mrs. Clinton is calling for “total amnesty in the first 100 days,” including “a virtual end to immigration enforcement” and for unauthorized immigrants to receive Social Security and Medicare.
In other words, Trump’s desperate need to be right (about the war) and his efforts to rally racists and xenophobes to his side dominate his lie-fests. 

Next up: The Times should try counting how many truths Trump actually tells in any given speech. If you take away his outright lies, his exaggerations and hyperbole, and his policy pronouncements that are clearly impossible to accomplish (i.e. deporting 11 million undocumented immigrants), my suspicion is that his lies would consistently outnumber his truths in any given speech.

UPDATE: The Trump lie-o-meter continues"

Now his campaign is making a desperate bid to make sure debate moderators don't fact-check Donnie's deceits on the fly. Here's campaign manager Kellyanne Conway pushing back against the idea Sunday on “This Week”:

“I really don’t appreciate the campaigns thinking it is the job of the media to go and be these virtual fact-checkers,” Kellyanne Conway said, in an apparent attempted jab at the Clinton campaign. 
She also declared that Matt Lauer did a ""great job"" at the Commander in Chief Forum—a sure sign Lauer did a crappy job if you needed more proof.

Meanwhile, Mike Pence took a stab at working the refs in advance of the debate by floating his own lie about CNN anchor Candy Crowley's correction of Mitt Romney in a 2012 debate:

“Well, I think we all had this experience a few years ago of Mitt Romney being interrupted and being challenged on an assertion he made,” Pence said.  “I believe it was about the tragedy in Benghazi, and it turned out the moderator was wrong.”
Sorry, Mike, Crowley was not wrong. Pence went on to assure CBS’s John Dickerson Sunday that during Monday’s debate Trump would “absolutely...speak the truth to the American people.” Uh-huh."

The article begins by identifying the Mercers, long-time backers of Ted Cruz who now run a pro-Trump super PAC, as the “one key bridge” between the former rivals. The story claims “the Mercers played a role behind the scenes encouraging a detente.”

In a statement to the Washington Post, the Mercers signaled support for Cruz’s decision and explained why they believe this election is so critical:

For the first time in many decades, American voters have the chance to turn their backs on the political elite, an elite both Democrat and Republican, that has chosen as its leader Hillary Clinton, a dedicated foe of both the First and Second Amendments and the most dishonest, corrupt, and incompetent politician ever to seek the American presidency. Even such great Americans as Mitt Romney and George Bush have stooped to endorse Mrs. Clinton rather than risk electing a president who follows the will of the people. We have long supported Senator Ted Cruz. He has waged a fearless battle against the elite throughout his career. We are delighted that he is joining us and a growing army of Americans in support of Donald J. Trump’s candidacy for the presidency of the United States of America.

Following the statement, the Post included this parenthetical fact-check:

(Neither Romney nor either of the Bush presidents — George H.W. Bush and George W. Bush — has endorsed Clinton. A family friend said George H.W. Bush plans to vote for Clinton, but his aides have not publicly confirmed that.)

The Post, which is owned by globalist tech billionaire Jeff Bezos, felt it necessary to declare that neither the Bushes nor Romney have formally “endorsed” Hillary Clinton. This is a defensive posture by the Post and a dishonest one at that.

Mitt Romney has actively fought Donald Trump, starting with staging a widely publicized comeback speech specifically to attack Donald Trump. If only he had opposed Barack Obama with the same vigor! The 2012 GOP nominee has also actively encouraged third-partiers to campaign against Trump, mocked Trump’s family, and held a “NeverTrump gathering,” to name a few things.

The last two Republican presidents have been conspicuously absent from the national dialogue during this election cycle, with the exception of the prominent rumor that George H.W. Bush will be voting for Hillary Clinton. His aides have not publicly denied it.

It’s obvious to any observer of American politics with common sense that for past presidents and nominees of the Republican Party to not support the GOP’s chosen candidate is tantamount to endorsing Hillary Clinton. Only the smug, deluded, and left-wing disagree with this.

But no one accused the establishment of having common sense.

While Romney, the Bushes, and the media play word games, the Executive and Judicial Branches hang in the balance.

What is perhaps most noteworthy about the article is not what the “Bezos Post” chose to fact-check, it’s what they chose not to fact-check. The Mercers state unequivocally that Hillary Clinton is “a dedicated foe of both the First and Second Amendments and the most dishonest, corrupt, and incompetent politician ever to seek the American presidency.”

So, not only is Clinton the least qualified candidate ever to seek the highest office in the land, but she is also, according to the statement, anti-U.S. Constitution.

These claims did not merit a Washington Post footnote (differing on the semantics of the word “endorsement” did).

Thus, by employing the Post’s own standard of when to include a clarifying parenthetical, it is safe to assume they affirm the fact that Hillary Clinton is “the most dishonest, corrupt, and incompetent politician ever to seek the American presidency.”

We couldn’t agree more."

“Mr. Trump agreed that the military assistance provided to Israel and missile defense cooperation with Israel are an excellent investment for America. Mr. Trump said that under a Trump administration, there will be extraordinary strategic, technological, military and intelligence cooperation between the two countries,” the campaign said in a statement. “Mr. Trump recognized Israel as a vital partner of the United States in the global war against radical Islamic terrorism.”

Trump and Netanyahu also discussed Israel’s border security and the methods it uses to repel and expel invaders, particularly its border fence.

A Donald Trump administration would also “accept the long-standing Congressional mandate to recognize Jerusalem as the undivided capital of the State of Israel,” the statement read."
100057,1002,Farage: ‘Hillary Clinton Is an Outdated Twentieth Century Candidate’,http://www.breitbart.com/london/2016/09/25/nigel-farage-hillary-clinton-twentieth-century-candidate/,3,"Hillary Clinton is a “twentieth-century candidate” who stands for “failed ideas”, Nigel Farage has said, adding “if you want change, you vote for Trump”.
Speaking to Breitbart London’s editor in chief Raheem Kassam, the Member of the European Parliament (MEP) and former UKIP leader Nigel Farage said:

“Hillary Clinton is a twentieth century candidate standing on twentieth century ideas that are now outdated because they haven’t worked and they have failed.

“She is the continuity candidate so if you want things to stay exactly as they are with big business and big politics inside the Washington Beltway running your lives then you vote for Hillary.

“But if you want change, you vote for Trump.”



He continued: “There are enough people who are unhappy about the direction that America is going in, dissatisfied with the growing inequality between rich and poor, and concerned about safety, security, and terrorism.

“For all of those reasons I think Trump has momentum and I now think he will win.”

Remarking on why he strongly believes that Mr. Trump will win the election, Mr. Farage said: “I think that the new campaign team that he’s got around him – including Breitbart’s own Steve Bannon – have got him into the right place. I think he’s shown not just discipline in his messages, he also looks more relaxed. There have been some lighter movements.”

Reflecting on his own career in British politics, the man known as “Mr. Brexit” said: “I’ve been prepared to kick back hard against an establishment that have coalesced around a view of the world that wasn’t mine and wasn’t the view of the silent majority.

“So I’ve fought hard and I’ve punched hard. Anyone who has seen my speeches in the European parliament know that.

“But I think it’s equally important to show that there is a human side to you. That you’re real and you shouldn’t be afraid to smile or have a bit of a laugh. I think you should just be yourself.

“That’s one reason why Trump’s turned things around. He’s shown a lighter side”

Anticipating that Ms. Clinton will be combative towards Mr. Trump during the first presidential debate on Monday the 26th of September, Mr. Farage advised the Republican nominee to keep on message and ignore any “digs and jibes” from Ms. Clinton.

“Provided he doesn’t stoop to her level,” said Mr. Farage, “and he just talks directly to what’s going to be a massive audience on Monday night. He’ll do very ,very well.”

Asked what advice he would give Mr. Trump, the man who delivered the Leave vote in the UK-EU referendum said: “Your job, Mr. Trump, if you want to win this presidential election, is to represent the little people.

“Your job is to represent the people who don’t work for the giant multinationals, for the people that aren’t rich, the law-abiding people who work and pay their taxes, and bring up their kids.”"
100058,1003,DONALD TRUMP:REPRESENTATIVE AMERICAN,http://www.huffingtonpost.com/eli-zaretsky/donald-trumprepresentativ_b_12185834.html?utm_hp_ref=politics,3,"Donald Trump: Representative American

According to the official narrative of this Presidential campaign, there are two Americas. One, while certainly flawed, is nonetheless essentially broad-minded, reasonable and tolerant. The other has a racist, anti-immigrant and misogynist core, broadened by resentful, unemployed industrial workers. Just as there are two Americas, so there are two candidates. One is a typical politician; she trims the facts but is ultimately well meaning. The other is a flagrant liar, braggadocio, someone who flaunts his genital equipment, has no respect for women or racial minorities, and could easily turn America into a police state.

To understand the construction of this narrative, consider the relation of religion and magic in medieval Europe. Then, too, there were two worlds. When an un-credentialed popular healer cast a spell over a sick cow, that was magic, but when the Catholic Priest sprinkled holy water, that was religion. Over time, not only did the distinction between magic and religion become blurred, but also increasing numbers of people began to pay attention to the fact that it was the Catholic Church that was always drawing the line between magic and religion. These people were protestors or Protestants and they launched a reform movement, the Reformation. In my view, we need a new reformation, not to restore true religion, but to challenge the invidious, hierarchical, self-serving authority of those who are constructing the narrative of this campaign. 

I am not denying that Donald Trump is an egregious, unappealing person, who would be dangerous as President. I intend to vote for Hillary Clinton, as I believe is now obligatory to say. But I cannot stop with that affirmation. I also want to register my protest at the institutions and powers that provide the dominant narrative: the New York Times, the Obama/Clinton circle that runs the Democratic Party, the financial powers who call almost all of the shots, the foreign policy establishment that has put the US at war with so many people throughout the world, the Nobel-Prize economists who found not only Trump but also Sanders beyond the pale, the experts who live and die by the market and its surrogate and finest expression, the media.

To be specific: the reason I find the line between Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump more porous and shifting than others do rests on how I see Trump. To me, his essential character is that of a salesman. His real mark is telling us that things he is selling are HUGE, BEAUTIFUL, GREAT, UNBELIEVABLE and so forth. True he presses various racial and sexual buttons when he does this, but that is the nature of salesmanship in America. That is our culture.

Consider that the sitting President ran in 2008 promising a new direction, away from Bush’s “War on Terror.” Of course, after he took office, the talking heads all told us that we were foolish for believing his promises— “suckers” is the ad-man’s term— as if we had purchased the Brooklyn Bridge. Consider the so-called “defense” establishment, who claim not to torture, just “enhanced interrogation.” Consider that every ad we see— for cars, for cereal, for medicines— is based on exaggeration and false promises. Consider our unending need for entertainment, stimuli, excitement, for something new, the essential lack of seriousness of our culture, the commercialization of our intellectual life and our universities.

So please do not point a finger at Donald Trump, and demand, “where did he come from”? Vote against him, of course, but recognize that he is one of us. We have built a culture, which both domestically and internationally, rests if not on lies then on shallow distortions, exaggerations, faux-expertise and dishonest claims to authority, for ultimately that is what a market culture is. Ask not from whence Donald Trump arises. He comes from us."
100059,1003,What Should Replace the Republican Party?,http://www.huffingtonpost.com/john-c-wathey/what-should-replace-the-r_b_12177930.html?utm_hp_ref=politics,3,"Once the venerable party of Lincoln, the Republicans split off from the Whigs in 1854 to oppose slavery, and for a century stood for fiscal restraint, free enterprise and principled conservatism. Their demise probably began with Richard Nixon’s “southern strategy“ of 1968 — the deliberate pandering to white racist Democrats of the southern states — but Barry Goldwater’s nomination four years earlier had also been a harbinger of doom. Now, as Tom Friedman has pointed out, the party is an empty shell of its former self, the rusting hulk of a Rube Goldberg contraption slapped together to garner the support of Christian fundamentalists, the gun lobby, the Tea Party, global warming deniers, birthers and other right-wing conspiracy theory nuts. In hindsight, the nomination of Donald Trump seems the inevitable climax of this recent and sad history.

Whether Trump wins or loses in November, the political party he hijacked is dead. Most of its traditional constituency — thoughtful conservatives who care about solving real problems through compromise — have been purged. They need a new political home, as do other disaffected citizens, but what form might that take? What should it be called? What big ideas should it advocate? What principles should guide it?

Science as a Way of Solving Problems

I have no law degree or experience in government. I’m not a historian. My background is in science and biology, which may seem irrelevant to these questions. But science is by far the most successful method humans have devised for finding truth and solving problems. It opened our eyes to the vast size and age of our universe, doubled our lifespans and took us to the moon. Could the principles at the core of the scientific method — honesty, humility and a ruthless insistence on discarding ideas that conflict with empirical evidence — guide a political party? And could we make better use of scientific insights from nature in the way we manage human affairs? I think so, and a party that championed this approach could win support from thinking people across the political spectrum.

Don’t get me wrong. I’m not advocating the resurrection of the Technocracy Movement of the 1930s. I’m not even suggesting that political leaders should have degrees in science or engineering, though that might help. Instead I’m suggesting that our way of choosing social policies should, as much as possible, follow the scientific method. Science is not merely a body of knowledge about how nature works. Above all it is a method for finding truth and solving problems, one that mimics biological evolution in the way it explores the vast space of possible solutions. A lovely solution found by evolution. Image credit: Wikimedia: Elaine R. Wilson

We see similar dynamics in free-market economic systems. We have not, however, seen much of it in politics, where slavish adherence to intuitively appealing ideologies generates an impoverished menu of options: cutting entitlement spending versus higher taxes on the rich; a single-payer healthcare system versus private health insurance; private school vouchers versus greater pay for teachers in public schools. In these and other problem domains, ideology has blinded us to that vast space of possible solutions.

Mathematician, poet and philosopher Jacob Bronowski made essentially the same point sixty-five years ago in The Common Sense of Science. At a time when the threat of global nuclear war darkened our collective mood, he wrote: [S]cience is the acceptance of what works and the rejection of what does not. That needs more courage than we might think.
It needs more courage than we have ever found when we have faced our worldly problems. This is how society has lost touch with science: because it has hesitated to judge itself by the same impersonal code of what works and what does not. We have clung to Adam Smith and Burke, or we have agitated for Plato and Aquinas, through wars and famine, through rising and falling birth-rates, and through libraries of learned argument. And in the end, our eyes have always wandered from the birth-rate to the argument: from the birth-rate to what we have wanted to believe... Here is our ultimate hope of saving ourselves from extinction. We must learn to understand that the content of all knowledge is empirical; that its test is whether it works; and we must learn to act on that understanding in the world as well as in the laboratory.
[p. 152, Harvard University Press 1967 edition] What Would Scientific Politics Look Like?

If this fantasy could be realized in a new political party, it would be a striking break from the past. Like an electron in its quantum mechanical realm, this new party could not be localized with certainty to any one place on the political spectrum. That fact alone might increase its appeal in a time of unprecedented political gridlock, obstruction and frustration. Its big unifying principle would be its method of solving problems. Of course good old-fashioned political haggling, deal-making and voting would still be needed in Congress to decide which problems to tackle and, more importantly, to choose criteria by which we will judge the success or failure of alternative solutions. But having made those decisions, open-minded experimentation with multiple solutions in parallel would be the immediate goal, rather than a single solution dictated by ideology.

For many problems, especially economic ones, it might be best not to specify any tentative solutions, but instead to shape economic incentives and let the free market explore the solution space. This is what Germany did to increase its use of renewable energy and decrease its contribution to global warming. Anyone could make real money — enough to make the effort worthwhile — by installing solar panels and selling their excess electricity to the grid. This required a subsidy paid by residential customers of the electrical utility, so the cost of electricity increased for those who didn’t put up solar panels. But even those people responded to the price incentive: they found ways to use less electricity. Timber framed house with an array of photovoltaic panels in Buschhoven near Bonn, Germany.

A similar approach could help with the coming crisis in Medicare solvency. Medicare might survive if wasteful and unnecessary procedures could be reduced, and this might happen naturally if patients and healthcare providers had the right incentives. Suppose, for example, that there were some formula for limiting the total Medicare benefits that each person could receive over his or her life. Both patients and doctors would have an incentive to use that limited resource wisely, but only if the system had complete price transparency. The cost of every medical procedure, device and drug would need to be known up front by all concerned, and patients would need to have the freedom to do comparative shopping. In such a system, real costs could be weighed along with medical risks and benefits — something that is impossible in our current healthcare system.

But what formula should be used for limiting benefits? Should exceptions be allowed for certain medical conditions? Should the limit be age-dependent, such that people above a specified age lose coverage for heroic and expensive life-saving procedures? How should the formula be related to the balance in the Medicare trust fund? These are difficult questions, but experimentation is the way to answer them, and it would help to have a political party that embraces this empirical and exploratory approach.

Lessons From Nature

And when that party sets its political priorities, it should also embrace our scientific understanding of reality. The acknowledgement of and response to global warming is an obvious example, but there are less obvious and more important lessons we can take from nature. One is the observation that organisms normally live in dynamic equilibrium with their environment. “Equilibrium, not Growth” may not be a catchy slogan for a bumper sticker, but it is the hallmark of an enduring species, and we ignore it at our peril. We have increased Earth’s carrying capacity for humans by decreasing it for other species, a shortsighted strategy that leads to mass extinction. We are currently on track for a global population of about 11 billion humans on Earth by the end of this century, a number that is unsustainable if these billions are to have even a modestly comfortable standard of living. Stabilizing our numbers and preserving biodiversity should be high priorities for a party that takes its lessons from nature.

What should this party be called? Tom Friedman suggested “New Republican Party,” but that suggests too small a departure from the party of Trump, or even of Lincoln. Of course “Scientific Party” comes to mind, but this sounds too much like familiar and dubious attempts to imbue wholly undeserving movements with the credibility of science, merely by tacking on the label — Mary Baker Eddy’s “Christian Science,” for example, or L. Ron Hubbard’s “Scientology.” But since this is my fantasy, I’ll offer my current favorite choice for a name: the “Pragmatic Party.” It has a nice ring to it and seems to express the essence of the idea.

Prospects for a Pragmatic Party

Whether this fantasy will ever be realized remains to be seen. I admit it seems far-fetched in a country where about 40 percent of adults believe in young-earth creationism. Yet there is hope in our younger generation, who are far more accepting of scientific reality. Ironically the Trump phenomenon offers some hope, too. Only a broken primary system could allow someone like Donald Trump to get this close to the presidency. Many people, conservatives among them, feel a strong and urgent need to fix this. A good Pragmatist would respond with a list of possible fixes. If the primary electorate is unrepresentative of the general electorate, then we need to make primaries look more like the general election. There are many possibilities. One of my favorites would be to eliminate primaries altogether by using ranked-choice voting. You may have even better ideas. Let’s experiment! John C.

100060,1003,Is Donald Like Ronald? We Ask RReagan And MMatalin To Compare The 1980 And 2016 Debates,http://www.huffingtonpost.com/mark-green/is-donald-like-ronald-we-_b_12188206.html?utm_hp_ref=politics,3,"Each panelist has inside experience with presidential debates moving the needle — how Reagan passed his ‘Commander-in-Chief’ orals and how Gore won on points but, sigh, lost politically. Since Trump, Clinton & Holt each benefits from a calm persona, the Host thinks this debate may be far more about policy than personality. Isn’t that a good thing?

Pre-Debate Scorecard. Ron thinks that one 1980 debate and this upcoming 2016 one are similar since “the challenger has an advantage with a sitting president [or prominent senator/SecofState] by appearing along side them in an equal way. Also, my father had a number of debates under his belt from the primaries while Carter didn’t — like the way Romney won the first debate with [a rusty] Obama. After it was over, we all thought he had done very well because he made no big mistakes. The next day, while Carter may have won on points and been regarded as ‘smarter’, that’s not how the public judges debates, rather on visual, tone, confidence.”

Mary sees one similarity between Donald and Ronald: “Reagan was so demonized by the left that he easily beat expectations — and Trump may also” on the vitally important “Commander-in-Chief” test. While Ron doesn’t disagree with the expectations point, “Trump doesn’t know anything and my father knew alot of things. Also, since Hillary knows her stuff so well, she may be a perfect foil to this shameless sociopath.”

Host: while Trump could win a Rally-Runoff because of his proven skills addressing an audience of 20,000, she’s spent maybe 99% of her life preparing for this debate while he’s spent, what, 1% on issues?

What’ll Holt do? Ron speculates that the “mood in the room” may now be to pursue Trump more aggressively since, after thousands of articles on her emails and the Clinton Foundation, “it’s time to start inquiring into recent disclosures about his finances” — taxes, ‘charity’, illegal $25,000 to AG Bondi. “And the way that Matt Lauer went into the tank for Trump did Holt no favors”...although the Host wonders whether the fail of NBC’s Today Show host makes it more likely that NBC’s Nightly News anchor will note obvious falsehoods. (E.g.: “Secretary Clinton, Mr. Trump’s comment just now that your campaign was also involved in the so-called birther movement has been debunked by all fact-checking organizations. You agree with them and hasn’t your opponent now moved beyond the issue of the president’s birth?”]

How will the twin terror attacks of last week and the two police shootings of black men this past weekend frame part of the debate? Does Trump have a political advantage on both since all he needs to is play on fear and say “be tough”? Mary says yes “because Democrats have been in charge of our national security for eight years and there’s no doubt there are more such terrorist acts and cells now and our intelligence is worse.” Host: perhaps but there’s certainly no doubt that thousands more died in Bush 43’s eight years because of 9/11 than anything under Obama.”

Ron.: “But if a voter wants a thoughtful president who waits until more is known before reacting or over-reacting, that favors Hillary.”

As for the two videoed gun deaths in Tulsa and Charlotte, why did one lead to days of rioting but not the other? We note that the film was quickly released in Tulsa and the officer who shot and killed the unarmed victim was indicted for second degree manslaughter while nothing like that happened for days in Charlotte.

Ron criticizes Trump for emphasizing the return of Stop-and-Frisk “which such a big success in New York City.” Says Reagan: “Not only didn’t it reduce crime there, it would again discriminate against black and brown youth. The problems go deeper that that. What’s going on in officers’ heads that leads them to use their guns so readily in these cases? This appears to be an issue more of blue than white or black.”

“What the hell do you have got to lose?” says Trump of minorities locked in failing inner-city communities? To which Ron responds “apparently their civil rights since stop and frisk was ruled unconstitutional in New York City.” Clinton focused afterwards on “institutional racism,” although GOP VP nominee Mike Pence took offence at using that term. Mary acknowledges only that “Some cops overreact when facing possible death. Black men are often harassed for no reason. And many black families complain that there aren’t enough police in their communities.”

So who will “win” the Debate? Because Clinton is heavily favored due to her history, Mary concludes that “if Trump doesn’t do something totally insane, people will say that she did as well as expected but so did Trump, which won’t move any of their voters.” Ron agrees: “Hillary’s already won the debate on points because of how much she knows and he doesn’t know anything. So it’s unlikely that the Debate will have much of an impact.”

Host: 100 million or so may watch — including some soft Trump and Clinton voters — and it really won’t affect the result or margin in November? This Monday night, some pundits will give in to temptation to say, “well he didn’t fall off his chair — he looks Commander-in-Chief- ish.” But the next morning most voters will know that they saw only one president on that stage. So my prediction: she’ll end the week ahead by 6 and stay ahead.”

Quick Takes: Wells Fargo fraud. DOT on Driver-less cars. Sklttles. 

Consensus! Sen Warren’s take-down of the Wells Fargo CEO was epic and spot-on since 5000 employees cheating customers by creating fake accounts to generate fees is, says Mary, “crony capitalism” at its worst. The Host adds that it’s actually more corporate crime at its worst and shows the need for the Consumer Finance Protection Bureau which congressional Republicans want to eliminate,

Both panelists wonder why we moving into the Driverless Car era since “no one asked for them or clamored for them”, in Ron’s words. “They will exist so people can go on-line to and from work. I can see them doing well as an Uber-type car that can pick up people.” Also, what about thousands of lives saved since they won’t drive while drunk or distracted?

As for Donald Trump Jr.’s analogy that, just as no one would eat a bowl of Skittles if three were poisoned, American shouldn’t let in Syrian refugees. Matalin thinks this a nothing-burger of a gaffe. Reagan thinks that DJT Jr is at the least “mathematically stupid” since the odds are closer to 1 in 3 billion you’ll be killed by a refugee. The Host says that “the odds of being killed by a Skittle is probably higher...and when it comers to the Strumph family, the apples don’t fall far.”"
100061,1006,Morning Consult: Trump finally pulls ahead of Clinton… barely,http://hotair.com/archives/2016/09/25/morning-consult-trump-finally-pulls-ahead-clinton-barely/,3,"Another week ticks away on the countdown clock and another round of polling from Morning Consult finds Donald Trump’s previously stalled momentum creeping back into motion. For the first time since the conventions at the end of July, this survey shows trump with a slight edge over Clinton among likely voters when all four of the measured candidates are offered as options.

Donald Trump leads Hillary Clinton by 1 percentage point among likely voters who were polled a few days ahead of the much-anticipated debate between the two presidential candidates. The debate will take place Monday evening.

The ratings for the televised match-up between the two candidates are expected to be at record highs. Two-thirds of registered voters say they expect to watch the debate, with 41 percent saying they are “very likely” to watch it.

In a nationwide poll of 1,712 likely voters taken Sept. 22 through Sept. 24, Trump was the choice for 39 percent of respondents, while Clinton was the choice for 38 percent. The difference between the two candidates is within the margin of error.
Here’s the track of the four way race over the past few weeks. If you take Johnson and Stein out of the equation Clinton edges back into the lead, 44-42. In the broader sample of registered voters Clinton holds a one point lead.

The mix of participants in the likely voter sample has once again taken a strange shift, but in an unexpected direction. You may recall that in last week’s survey, Hillary Clinton was hanging on to a one or two point lead for the second week in a row, but at that time the likely voter D/I/R split without leaners was 39/29/32. In this week’s crosstabs there’s been a dramatic shift. This time, again without leaners, the D/I/R is somehow 36/32/32. The Democratic advantage in the survey dropped from D+7 to D+4. And with that shift, Trump dropped one point from the previous week while Hillary went down by four. (The two third party candidates picked up one each to make up for part of that dip.) When you take the sample shift into account it almost looks as if there was no real movement at all.

In other words, taking MC’s running survey as a trend indicator, Trump has held on to the ground he made up after Clinton’s post-convention bump, but neither of them has broken out for any open field running yet. Tomorrow night will be their big opportunity to put some gas in the tank as we weather the first debate, and that’s the last topic I wanted to touch on from the survey. Right now we’re down to the point where the parties have largely retreated to their respective corners and the candidates are slugging it out for the independent and undecided voters. But those are precisely the people who are least likely to watch.

Independent voters have a less strong opinion about the debates, suggesting that the TV events be more important in terms of shoring up commitment from party affiliates than winning over undecided voters. Independents are less likely to watch Monday’s debate than either Republicans or Democrats; 54 percent of independents say they expect to watch, while 75 percent of Republicans and 70 percent of Democrats plan to tune in.

Twice as many independents (25 percent) say they are “not at all likely” to watch Monday’s debate than Republicans (13 percent) or Democrats (12 percent).
Tucking this poll away along with the rest of the national surveys, one thing is clear. The national race is a coin toss at this point. In the swing states, Trump his picking up a lot of lost territory, but he’s nowhere near being safely past 270 electoral votes. This thing is entirely up for grabs right now, and if you ever wished to live to see interesting times, soak it all in because this is it, baby."
100062,1006,And now the dead are eagerly voting in Colorado,http://hotair.com/archives/2016/09/25/now-dead-eagerly-voting-colorado/,3,"Keep in mind that opponents of voter ID laws or any other form of electoral integrity measures have repeatedly assured us that voter fraud never happens.

We recently looked at the results of a survey which shows that roughly half of the country believes that voter fraud is real and takes place on at least a somewhat regular basis. But even the authors of that poll were dumbfounded and prefaced their findings with all sorts of reminders about how there’s simply no evidence to support that idea. Tell that to the people of Colorado, who were the latest to learn that many of their dearly departed were still somehow participating in democracy with alarming regularity. (CBS 4, Denver)

A CBS4 investigation has found multiple cases of dead men and women voting in Colorado months and in some cases years after their deaths, a revelation that calls into question safeguards designed to prevent such occurrences.

“We do believe there were several instances of potential vote fraud that occurred,” said Colorado Secretary of State Wayne Williams after reviewing the CBS4 findings. “It shows there is the potential for fraud.”

The cases of dead men and women casting ballots ranged from El Paso County in southern Colorado to Denver and Jefferson County. CBS4 discovered the fraudulent voting by comparing databases of voting histories in Colorado against a federal death database.
Colorado’s Secretary of State (a Republican, by the way) still seemed to want to play this down, only admitting that there was the potential for voter fraud and that the system has some gaps. I suppose that’s natural, given that nobody wants something this embarrassing showing up on their watch, but it’s also another case of sheer denial of reality. The local news investigation highlights the case of Sara Sosa of Colorado Springs. The poor dear passed away in 2009, but continued to cast her ballot in 2010, 2011, 2012 and 2013. Now, Sara was married, so the first suspect might be her husband. Was he “keeping it in the family” and voting for her after she went to her eternal reward? Nope. Turns out that Mr. Sosa died in 2008 himself. And yet that didn’t stop him from voting the following year either.

And this wasn’t statewide. We’re only talking about an investigation into a couple of counties and they came up with dozens of dead voters. It’s on a smaller scale than our previous story of this type where the dead in one section of California were found to be voting in the hundreds, but it’s still troubling in the extreme. This is particularly true when you consider the 2002 election in Colorado’s 7th district where their representative to Congress was decided by 121 votes, as the reporter in this article notes.

So if we allow the media to ignore the California findings, this becomes yet another “isolated instance” of a few bad apples, right? Obviously not. I hate to keep beating a dead horse here (pun intended) but this goes back to what I’ve been trying to get across for years. Liberals get away with saying that voter fraud isn’t a problem based on the small number of confirmed, prosecuted instances on record. But the low numbers are a result of the fact that nobody is looking for it. When they do, they find it, and Colorado has simply proven that rule of thumb once again."
100063,1006,Dead heat: Clinton’s lead down to two points nationally and in Pennsylvania,http://hotair.com/archives/2016/09/25/dead-heat-clintons-lead-two-points-nationally-pennsylvania/,3,"Jazz already got to the new Morning Consult poll, but the conclusion there is the same as the conclusion here. Both nationally and in Trump’s most elusive battleground state, it’s anyone’s ballgame with the debates set to begin tomorrow.

There’s a common thread in the new national survey ABC/WaPo survey and the new Pennsylvania poll by Muhlenberg, too. In both cases, you see Republican holdouts finally swinging away from Gary Johnson and towards Trump. Both polls were conducted before Ted Cruz’s very belated endorsement, but I think Cruz’s timing is in sync with other Trump skeptics. As Election Day finally appears on the horizon, most GOPers are beginning to line up. Two weeks ago ABC/WaPo had the race 46/41 for Clinton, with Johnson pulling nine percent. Today, Hillary’s still stuck at 46 but Trump is up to 44 percent with Johnson dropping to five. The difference is Republican voters shifting away from the third-party candidate: “Two weeks ago, 22 percent of Republicans who didn’t back Trump in the primaries were going to vote for Johnson. Now it’s only 8 percent.”

Same deal in Pennsylvania, where Muhlenberg finds Hillary’s 40/32 lead of a week ago shrinking to 40/38 now. Where’d that extra six points for Trump come from? You know where:

“Partisans coming home to their nominee is an expected part of any campaign as you get into the closing days,” said Chris Nicholas, a GOP consultant based in Harrisburg. “What’s notable here is the very large shift and we’re not close to the final days.”

A demographic analysis showed a double-digit jump in Trump’s support among Republicans after Trump underperformed with that group previously. This week, 85 percent of likely GOP voters said they’d choose him over Clinton, compared with 71 percent in the prior survey.

While Johnson had appeared to peel away some Republicans from Trump, that effect diminished this week, Borick said. Johnson fell by 6 points in the four-way matchup, while Trump gained by the same figure.
Not only that, but more Trump voters in PA say they’re voting for him than against Hillary, which is unusual. All summer, “against Hillary” has typically scored higher among Trump backers than “for Trump” has. Something has changed, at least temporarily, to make the people supporting him feel more confident about him. The fact that he’s still polling in the high 30s in a state he badly needs to win isn’t great news, but given that Clinton has been stuck at 40 for two weeks, that says less about Trump’s weakness vis-a-vis Hillary than it does about the reality that there are lots of undecideds in Pennsylvania. More than 20 percent of the electorate is still in play with three debates to come.

Back to ABC/WaPo, though, where the splits among white voters by age and educational level are mind-boggling: Trump leads among white men without a college education by 59 farking points. That’s exactly the sort of world-beating margin he needs among his base to pull this off. And his margin might not be done growing. Check out this trendline: Romney won that group by 31 points in 2012. Trump’s path to victory has always required him to outperform Mitt among working-class white men and now he’s doing it, by historic margins. Which raises the question: How is he still behind? If he’s crushing it among white men without a college degree and winning white women without a college degree and college-educated white men by double digits, how can he be losing? The answer is Hillary’s advantage among college-educated women, which has grown over the last two weeks from a 10-point lead to a 25-point lead(!) now. That’s why she’s running this ad, to try to build on it. Her formula all summer was to pile up nonwhite votes as high as, or higher than, Trump’s wall of white working-class male votes and then have white college grads push her over the top. White female college grads are complying, but if traditional Republican voters continue to come home to Trump, her formula won’t work.

In fact, it might not work anyway. WaPo notes that, despite her huge advantage among nonwhites, Clinton’s getting a smaller share of Obama’s 2012 voters than Trump is getting among Romney’s voters. She needs the Obama coalition to come through, and they’re barely coming through right now. Not only that, but after months of hype about “undercover Trump voters” possibly not registering to vote, there are more Hillary supporters in the ABC/WaPo poll who say they’re not registered than there are Trump supporters. That’s not all that surprising given that minorities tend to register at lower rates than whites, but Hillary’s vaunted ground game was supposed to remedy that problem somewhat. If her ground game is dominating his, how do you explain this? It may be that some Trumpers are misreporting whether they’ve been contacted or not. A Twitter pal notes that no less than 45 percent of Trump fans claimed awhile back that they’d seen a Trump ad on TV recently — even though, at the time, Trump hadn’t run any general-election ads yet. On the other hand, who needs a ground game when you’ve got a big enthusiasm advantage? Trump’s been betting all along that the greater enthusiasm among his fans will motivate them to turn out even without the usual GOTV outreach from a traditional campaign and that that’ll win him the election. He’s losing that bet right now if today’s topline numbers are right, but just barely. A week from now, he might be winning it.

The only truly discouraging news for Trump in either poll, I think, is the fact that ABC/WaPo continues to find terrible (although somewhat improved) numbers for him on questions of basic qualifications. Fifty-three percent of registered voters say he’s not qualified to be president, 55 percent say he doesn’t know world affairs well enough to serve effectively, and 58 percent say he lacks the temperament to serve effectively. Outside of his core base of white working-class men, just 43 percent say he’s qualified for the office. If you think Clinton’s going to win, that’s probably why — when push comes to shove, swing voters won’t trust the job to someone whom they fear isn’t able to do it. But then … that’s what the debates are for, right? Tomorrow is Trump’s chance to show the country that he knows his stuff and there’s really nothing Clinton can do to stop him. If he answers seriously and cogently and puts a dent in those “unqualified” numbers in the next round of polls, he’s the new favorite in November. Simple as that."
100064,1007,Trump Surging in Liberal Colorado and Maine,http://www.youngcons.com/trump-surging-in-liberal-colorado-and-maine/,3,"Donald Trump is polling so well right now across the country that Hillary Clinton has given up on battleground Ohio altogether.

He’s winning in Florida, as well.

If he pulls both the Buckeye and the Sunshine states, Trump wins the race – no doubt.

What’s crazy is that he’s even surging in two extremely liberal states, Colorado and Maine.


Is Trump doing well because people like him, or because they can finally see Hillary would be the absolute worst choice?

Doesn’t matter, does it?


From Breitbart:

Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump is gaining ground in Colorado and Maine on Hillary Clinton, according to polls released on the eve of the first presidential debate. In Maine’s first congressional district, Clinton leads Trump 50 percent to 28 percent. But in Maine’s second congressional district, Trump leads Clinton 48 percent to 34 percent. Only 59 percent polled said they had “definitely” decided who they’re voting for as president. The poll’s margin of error statewide is plus or minus four percent. In the critical swing state of Colorado, Clinton is eking out a tiny lead of only one and a half percent over Trump in RealClearPolitic’s polling average in a four-way race, 40.8 percent to 39.3 percent.

…

A Washington Post/ABC News poll found the two candidates locked in a virtual tie as the first debate approaches, while the L.A. Times Daily Tracking poll has Trump four points ahead of Clinton.

Hey, Barack.

What are you going to do knowing even liberal America is turning against your policies?

Legacy tarnished further.

How sad.

After all, if Trump wins it means Obama failed. "

Donald Trump is now leading nationwide in many polls.

You can be certain the billionaire will push his numbers early and often, while making Clinton look like a complete fool all along the way.

The L.A. Times Daily Tracking poll shows that Donald Trump is pulling ahead of Hillary Clinton again, now leading her by 4.1 points.

Trump is now at 46.4 percent while Clinton is at 42.3 percent, indicated that he is regaining his lead after he started trending downward. Trump was actually up by nearly seven points last Monday in this poll.


This poll is taken daily, with 3,000 citizens taking the time to answer who they’ll vote for.

100066,1007,Hillary Campaign Attempting to Influence How Moderators Handle Debates,http://www.youngcons.com/hillary-campaign-attempting-to-influence-how-moderators-handle-debates/,3,"Would you be surprised if I said Hillary Clinton is attempting to get the moderators firmly on her side during the debate?

Of course not.

Shouldn’t be too hard, though, if that’s what she aimed to do.

The majority of them are already going to be voting for her in November, anyways.


From Breitbart:

The Hillary Clinton campaign is making a last-minute effort to influence how moderators handle the presidential debates.


The first debate Monday puts NBC News’ Lester Holt front and center as Donald Trump and Hillary Clinton square off for the first time. Team Clinton wants Holt to intercede in the debate–and often.

“This is the role of the moderator … to call out those lies, and do it in real time,” Clinton communications director Jennifer Palmieri told reporters on a conference call. “To not do that is to give Donald Trump a very unfair advantage. Any candidate who tells this many lies clearly can’t win the debate on the merits.” “His level of lying is unprecedented in American politics,” Palmieri said of Trump.

Fox News’ Chris Wallace, who is moderating the final debate in Las Vegas, already said that his role is not to be a fact-checker.


But Lester Holt could be problematic. Holt is already drawing scrutiny from conservatives fearing a “Candy Crowley” moment that could swing the debate.

Moderators aren’t supposed to be fact-checkers. They’re supposed to, wait for it, moderate the debate.

I’d agree that a moderator has to be able to push back and not allow a candidate to get away with BS, but it has to be equal.

Both candidates are going to say things that need to be dealt with by Lester Holt, but he can’t let his biases control him one way or the other.

He has to be impartial.

Hillary Clinton trying to tell debate moderators Trump will be lying and they need to be ready to interrupt is about as low as it gets. Oh, also, Holt is a registered Republican, so hopefully he has the courage to stand up to Hillary and let her do the debating. We all remember the disaster in the 2012 debate when Mitt Romney got screwed by Candy Crowley. Candy came out a few days after the debate admitting she was wrong, but that means nothing. The damage was done. What matters is what happens during the debate when millions more Americans are paying attention, Hillary clearly understands this and is getting desperate."
100067,1008,"A Sporting Event Where Only One Team Obeys the Rules


",http://www.americanthinker.com/articles/2016/09/a_sporting_event_where_only_one_team_obeys_the_rules.html,3,"From childhood, we have had ingrained in us that in order for interactions between people to work, especially competitive interactions, everyone has to “follow the rules”. The reason we have rules is that we have people, and people are sometimes dishonest cheats. The rules are put in place to prevent the dishonest cheats from winning unfairly, because they are despicable thieves who would steal what rightfully belongs to someone else.

Nobody likes a cheat, except perhaps other cheats or those who stand to share in what the cheater steals from the honest participant. That is, nobody with an ounce of integrity, understanding the inevitability of chaos if half of all participants in an event are permitted to cheat, would agree to participate. Therefore, any system which is premised upon rules requires that independent arbiters, acting without bias and favoritism, intercede to enforce the rules so that each contest is determined by merit, rather than fraud and intimidation. This is called “integrity”.

Unfortunately, when the referees belong to the same organization, or “team”, as the half of the participants in an event who cheat, the system is no longer effective. Indeed, when the half that cheats has become so comfortable with cheating and lying and stealing that they have no reason or intention to stop, because there is no cost to them as long as their cronies remain in charge, the risk is that the rule-followers will never again know what it is like to have an event in which they have any hope or chance of not only competing, but sometimes winning.

After eight years of the most blatant and obvious corruption, we watch current events as if we have a splinter in our eye. An entire political party is so morally bankrupt that it no longer feels any need to hold its members to any rules at all. And yet, it controls the enforcement of the rulebook, and zealously enforces those rules against anyone who doesn’t belong to their lawless team. They do this smugly and self-righteously, as if it is their right and privilege to screw millions of people who follow the rules and believe that a society can only survive it its rules are followed by all, and enforced equally against all.

This is the only kind of fairness that the Constitution contemplated, because it is the only kind that man can control. One man cannot control whether another man with free will makes choices that will prove successful. We are not born owing what we will someday earn to morons who are too careless or brainwashed to make wise choices. As if to stand the theory of evolution on its head, Democrats exist to show us that Darwin was wrong. People do not evolve. They do not improve or adapt to better function in the ecosystem. No matter how much time goes by, humans will always have among them the cheats, the thieves, and the losers. We will always have among us the humans whose nature is dark and evil, those who are incapable or unwilling to place their self-interest behind the concept of a greater good. The world is their oyster, and they intend to steal every pearl they see.

At present, the Democratic party and its membership, particularly in positions of authority and in media, is participating in events as actors unbounded by any rule or law. The IRS commissioner still uses the IRS to target conservatives. The Obama administration is literally turning illegal aliens into citizens to unlawfully alter the outcome of the upcoming election, as Democrats have always done. They are rewarding criminals with early release from prison and restored voting rights simply to tip the scales. They are flooding our country with Muslim Syrians, whose culture is antithetical to ours, knowing the inevitable outcome will be an eventual conflict between those who believe in forcefully imposing Islamic theocracy and those few who still know and believe in the American Constitution. They are making secret alliances with our enemies, or merely surrendering to them out of abject cowardice or belief in common principles. They protect terrorists, who are the ultimate rule-breakers, while demonizing Americans, who cannot figure out what they may have done wrong, having done nothing but exist.

No matter which side of the aisle you are on, it is undeniable that any system that is premised upon rules will fail and break apart when one side gleefully cheats with impunity, but the other side is punished. You would not tolerate this if it was your own child’s sporting event, or one in which you had agreed to compete. You would not peacefully watch a professional event if one team got to do whatever it wanted, while the other team was policed by the cheats. Such an event would unnaturally reward vice and criminality, while punishing integrity.

At present, the Democratic party is the most successful example of a criminal enterprise that we have in this country. The Mafia was never as large and powerful as the Democratic party, but they were at least more honest. They never swore an oath to uphold the law and not enrich themselves with the property of others. There was no public trust betrayed. They pretended to be businessmen, but not to be public servants in order to gain control over the treasury and the arbitrary enforcement of laws against only their enemies.

The last eight years have been about building the brand, honing and perfecting the fraud, constructing the perfect machine with which to destroy what is left of a system of laws, rights and duties. The left believes in none of those concepts, or they would abide by them. They believe the lie of their own superiority and deformed morality. Hillary Clinton believes that disagreement with her is deplorable and irredeemable. She will rule as a tyrant, as spiteful and vengeful as any before her who was slowed by her enemies. Her objective is to utterly destroy the last vestiges of honor and integrity that made this country exceptional.  

One thing is certain. We cannot construct a new framework with the Left or its amoral members, just as we would not form a business or marriage or friendship with someone we know we can never trust or respect. Besides, they will try to revive the solutions of Leftist history before they will allow us freedom, from them and for ourselves.

100068,1008,Is Hillary Clinton Losing the 2016 Election?,http://www.americanthinker.com/articles/2016/09/is_hillary_clinton_losing_the_2016_election.html,3,"The anxiety is palatable.  The question will not be made audible, but it remains: is she losing this election?  Is it really slipping away?  To put it in the words of Hillary Clinton:  ""Why am I not winning by 50 points?""

1. Epistemological poisoning.  The depth of public outrage has been the consistent misunderstanding of all pundits trying to explain the current election.  Why is the public so mad?  Why do people seem to love Trump so much?  Those charged with telling us the truth – journalists, the federal government, politicians, academia, Hollywood, and the Church – do not.  The epistemological organs of our nation favor an illiberal anti-American view of the world, epitomized by the Jonathan Grubers and condescending Hollywood stars, that mocks the average American.

Sadly, even the Republican Party thinks this way about the average American, and for that, the public burned down the RNC.  While Democrats laughed, they never thought the populist fires could touch their perfect candidate.  That was the boundless hubris of a reactionary community emboldened by the echo chamber of leftist politics emanating from American institutions taken over by Jacobins.

Americans were tired of drinking the poison, so they shattered the epistemological world painfully constructed by the left.  This is not Plato's Blue Republic; it's a democracy where people can show up and vote.

2. Democrats started losing in 2010.  Democrats forget that they won last time on the basis of a change agent named Barack Obama.  He promised to fundamentally transform America.  We were so messed up after President Bush – according to Obama and his followers – that we needed this complete political overhaul.  In fact, the more experienced and established Hillary Clinton lost rather incredibly to this unknown advocate of hope and change.  She was the insider, and he was the outsider.  McCain was the insider, and Obama was the less experienced outsider.

But by 2010, the Democratic eternal dynasty of politics was already falling apart.  The Congress and almost every elected office in America began moving sharply right.  Presently, the nation has not had so many elected Republicans since the 1920s.  That was the Tea Party and the building outrage since Obamacare.

Democrats and the elite fooled themselves with the win they scored over Romney in 2012.  President Obama received millions fewer votes in 2012 than 2008, and the shine and appeal of the unknown was gone.  Obama was largely just another politician.  Republicans continued to gain more and more congressional control in 2014.  This surge has been ongoing for the Republicans since 2010.

Was Hillary ever as popular or as persuasive as Barack Obama?  The honest answer was always no.  The hope and change of Obama is the reciprocal cry of flyover country as they mob Donald Trump.  Hillary Clinton was foolish never even to try to triangulate against President Obama.  She left the promise of change wide open and tied herself hopelessly to the establishment and status quo. 

3. Lies, lies, lies.  Of course, trust of politicians is abysmally low, but Hillary and Bill Clinton represented a unique manifestation of how political deception could work and be made profitable.  Bernie Sanders warned about this, as did other parts of the true left, but it could never be taken too seriously.

If the truth were told, it was never Hillary's problem – it was the armies of people who lied for her.  She said a video caused Benghazi.  She helped put a filmmaker in jail to for his freedom of speech criticizing the prophet Muhammad.  But all of it was fine and rearranged to be made politically truthful.  The ""fact-checkers"" say she never argued in 2008 that Obama was born outside the U.S., cleverly avoiding the reality that her campaign handlers did.  Bill Clinton can say Trump is racist for saying he will make America great again, though that is exactly what Clinton said to get elected in 1992.

Partisans are frustrated that Trump is not being held to a high account of honesty like Hillary, but they miss the public's point.  Trump is not a politician, and they view his lies as an attempt to escape a government that finds us all guilty of crimes, from the environment to taxes to hate speech and even bad thoughts.  Trump is a wrecking ball that will, at least in their eyes, take down the elite world of deception and suppression – or so they hope.

There are dozens of other miscues that can be added to the mix: the peculiar belief that one can campaign while rarely holding press conferences, the odd communications about her health, the anemic audiences at rallies.  In the end, the reality that populism is always a potentially winning American political argument, and was precisely why she lost to Obama in 2008, never came to be accepted as a real threat to the 2016 campaign.  The laughter at poor Jeb Bush flailing away at a caricature that was Donald Trump never allowed the Clinton team to recognize the echo chamber they were in for months.  Outspending the millionaire Trump never really seemed to matter.

It all seemed so real: the convention bounce, the self-injuries of Trump, and the largely reassuring media voices.  History will show the signs – and that America typically gets the President she deserves.

100069,1008,Trump Sees the Jihadist Trojan Horse,http://www.americanthinker.com/articles/2016/09/trump_sees_the_jihadist_trojan_horse_.html,3,"Ever wonder why there are so many Muslims and Muslim countries in the world? Over the millennia many countries were conquered, but didn't remain Persian or Greek or Roman as the case may be. You see, the countries conquered in the name of Islam, became and remained Islamic. For example Pakistan, part of India, and Malaysia both were Hindu; Turkey, Iraq, Syria, Egypt and N. Africa were Christian; Afghanistan was Buddhist. They are all Islamic now.

This transformation was not by chance but by design. All these countries were conquered by force then shorn of their wealth and many of their women. Then the Muslim conquerors introduced Sharia and continued fighting the local inhabitants. The inhabitants were either forced to convert or accorded Dhimmi status. As time went on all cultures submitted and eventually became Islamic.

The advance of Islam was finally reversed in Spain and stopped at the Gates of Vienna in 1642. Thereafter the power of Islam went into decline but other than Spain, it never lost its hold on the people it conquered.  This decline was reversed in the Twentieth Century when Arabs became wealthy as a result of their vast oil reserves. This wealth was then deployed to conquer the west, not by Violent Jihad, but by Stealth Jihad.

This design was referred to as The Islamic Doctrine. It consists of Koran (14%) which stipulates that “there is no god but ALLAH and Mohammed is his messenger”, Sira, Mohammed’s biography (26%) and Hadiths, traditions, (60%). There are two different Korans combined into one, the Mecca Koran and the Medina Koran.

Dr. Moorthy Muthuswamy writes,

About sixty-one percent of the contents of the Koran are found to speak ill of the unbelievers or call for their violent conquest; at best only 2.6 percent of the verses of the Koran are noted to show goodwill toward humanity. About seventy-five percent of Muhammad’s biography (Sira) consists of jihad waged on unbelievers.

Mohammed started as a religious preacher in Mecca. It was during this period that the Koran 2:256 stipulated. “There is no compulsion in religion” and 109:1 stipulated “You have your religion I have mine.” Ultimately he was chased out of Mecca and migrated with his followers to Medina.

Then began the Jihad period.  From then on people were forced to convert under pain of death or were forced to live as Dhimmis (second class citizens) and pay (Jizya) for the privilege of living there.  

This Jihad continued until there was no more discord.

Koran 2:193. “Fight them (Kafirs) until there is no more discord and the religion of Allah reigns absolute but if they submit, then only fight those who do wrong.”

Thus it continues until everyone in the territory has submitted to Islam, accepts Dhimmi status and pays Jizya.

Quotes from the Qur'an and Hadith on war, violence, infidels, and unbelievers may be found here. For example:

Ayhat 8:12, “I shall cast terror into the hearts of those who are bent on denying the truth; strike, then, their necks, [O believers,] and strike off every one of their finger-tips!""

Sura 9:5,29,41. “Slay the idolators [non-Muslims] wherever ye find them, and take them captive, and besiege them, and prepare for them each ambush. Fight against such of those who have been given the Scripture as believe not in Allah nor the last Day…. Go forth, light-armed and heavy-armed, and strive with your wealth and your lives in the way of Allah! “

This inconsistency in the Koran is resolved by the doctrine of abrogation, wherein the Medina principles abrogate the Mecca principles.

Migration intends to overtake the host country through this doctrine. It is driven by Islam’s proscription against assimilation, and its will to dominate.

51% of the Koran concerns itself with the Kafir. It is a political doctrine not a religious one. There is no golden rule. Kafirs are to be subjugated. Muslims are to dominate.

Dr Bill Warner summarizes this as follows:

Migration is part of the doctrine of jihad. Migration is so important that the Islamic calendar is based upon the Hijra, Mohammed’s migration from Mecca to Medina. Why? Because it was migration that lead to the creation of jihad in Medina. And it was jihad that made Islam triumphant.

In the past Muslims tended to stay in Islamic countries. Today, the new politics is to migrate to Kafir lands and immerse themselves in local politics. This is the jihad of money, writing and speech. Their politics is to bring the Sharia to Kafir culture. An example is using Islamic money is to build departments in universities that will support Sharia and never criticize Islam.

To understand how they do it, read 4 Stages of Islamic Conquest.

Unfortunately this migration is encouraged by globalist leaders such as Chancellor Merkel and President Obama. And of course, Hillary Clinton aspires to be one of them.

Professor Belhaj explains elites “encourage migration and accommodate Islam”, and described the harmony between Muslim migrants and neoliberalism as “structural, and not accidental”.  “Migration is useful for the neo-liberal model of the borderless, minimal, global society…”

The Muslim Brotherhood met in 1991 and produced a document which set out its strategic goals for North America. The document was entered as evidence in the 2008 Holyland Terror Funding Trial. It contained among other things, the following paragraphs:

Enablement of Islam in North America, meaning: establishing an effective and a stable Islamic Movement led by the Muslim Brotherhood which adopts Muslims’ causes domestically and globally, and which works to expand the observant Muslim base, aims at unifying and directing Muslims’ efforts, presents Islam as a civilization alternative, and supports the global Islamic State wherever it is.

...the Movement must plan and struggle to obtain ""the keys"" and the tools of this process in carry out [sic] this grand mission as a 'Civilization Jihadist' responsibility.

The process of settlement is a ‘Civilization-Jihadist Process’ with all the word means. The Ikhwan [Muslim Brotherhood] must understand that their work in America is a kind of grand jihad in eliminating and destroying the Western civilization from within and ‘sabotaging’ its miserable house by their hands and the hands of the believers…

[W]e must possess a mastery of the art of “coalitions,” the art of “absorption” and the principles of “cooperation.”

Pres Obama and Secretary Clinton, upon taking office, embraced the Muslim Brotherhood and worked with them to depose Mubarak and Assad. Luckily General al Sisi reversed their victory in Egypt and Assad, with the help of Iran and Russia, thwarted their plans in Syria.

In “Why is Obama in Bed with the Muslim Brotherhood?” I wrote “The alliance between the Obama administration and the Muslim Brotherhood is the cornerstone of Obama’s New Middle East policy.”

Capt. Joseph R. John, USN (Ret), the Chairman of Combat Veterans for Congress PAC, wrote in June 2016:

Members of the Muslim Brotherhood, CAIR, and MPAC have sinister goals that are not in support of the US Constitution or The Bill of Rights.  They have become a very dangerous “Fifth Column” in the United States, appointed by Obama to very high and sensitive positions in the US Government agencies. 

For nearly 8 years Obama has been filling the Washington bureaucracy including DHS, the CIA, DOD, the National Security Council, the White House, the State Department, every US Intelligence Agency, and the US Armed Forces with thousands of members of the CAIR, MPAC, the Muslim Brotherhood, and other Muslim Brotherhood front groups.

In June of this year Donald Trump recognized the danger of Muslim migration and said, “This could be the all-time great Trojan horse.” And so it is but the US elites refuse to recognize it.

On August 15/16 he gave a speech on immigration and terrorism in which he clarified;

A Trump Administration will establish a clear principle that will govern all decisions pertaining to immigration: we should only admit into this country those who share our values and respect our people.

In the Cold War, we had an ideological screening test. The time is overdue to develop a new screening test for the threats we face today.

In addition to screening out all members or sympathizers of terrorist groups, we must also screen out any who have hostile attitudes towards our country or its principles – or who believe that Sharia law should supplant American law.

Those who do not believe in our Constitution, or who support bigotry and hatred, will not be admitted for immigration into the country.

So you can see, rather that limiting his policy to weeding out terrorists, he advocates weeding out Jihadists who want to subjugate America to Islam. This is not racism. It is common sense.

Trump has been stressing that Hillary Clinton wants to let in 550% more refugees than the 10,000 Obama let in. In response I wrote “Don’t be duped about Muslim migration to the US”  in which I pointed out that the problem is much bigger and that no distinction should be made between refugees and immigrants.

According to a report highlighted by Megyn Kelly,

According to the Report, Obama has issued over 832,000 green cards to Muslim majority countries in his first 6 years of his presidency. In addition, 482,000 Muslims overstayed their visas and are not being sent back. These Muslims support Sharia  to an astonishing degree. In Afghanistan 99%, in Iraq 91% and in Pakistan 70%. When in the US 70% vote Democrat.

And now Obama is intending to allow in another 1 million Muslims.

Jewish Americans are very supportive of allowing such numbers into the US. They argue either we have a duty to do so or that Jews should be more welcoming given the history of America banning Jewish immigration in the thirties and forties. But this analogy doesn’t hold up at all. Jews were no threat to Americans personally and to their values, whereas the Muslims are both. Furthermore Muslims are very anti-Semitic and very anti-Israel. The Muslims have many other countries they could go to. The Jews had no other country willing to take them in.  Jews are, in effect, welcoming their enemies into the country.

As for a duty to allow Muslim immigration or any immigration, there is none.

We need Donald Trump.

100070,1009,GLENN KESSLER ILLUSTRATES WHY MODERATORS SHOULDN’T “FACT CHECK”,http://www.powerlineblog.com/archives/2016/09/glenn-kessler-illustrates-why-moderators-shouldnt-fact-check.php,3,"In advance of Monday night’s debate, Hillary Clinton’s cheerleaders in the media have been encouraging moderator Lester Holt to contradict, during the debate, candidates whose assertions of fact they disagree with. Glenn Kessler, the liberal “fact-checker” for the Washington Post, even compiled a list of assertions he says don’t withstand fact-checking, the vast majority of which are by Donald Trump. He urges the moderator to “clip and save.”

It is wholly inappropriate for a moderator to argue with a candidate about facts, and Kessler’s piece illustrates one of the main reasons why. In his list of allegedly false facts articulated by Trump, Kessler includes this one:

The rise of ISIS is the direct result of policy decisions made by Obama and Clinton.

“This is false,” Kessler declares:

The Islamic terrorist group emerged as a direct result of the U.S. invasion of Iraq.

Thus, Kessler, who, wants moderators to use his list, is encouraging Lester Holt to debate Donald Trump about what caused the rise of ISIS — the policies of Obama and Clinton or the U.S. invasion of Iraq. Any fair-minded person will realize that this is not a moderator’s proper role.

Moreover, Kessler, the fact-checker, doesn’t seem even to understand the difference between a factual question, a matter of opinion, and a mixed question of fact and opinion.

Statements about causation — e.g., what policy produced what result — tend not to be pure questions of fact. Complex phenomena usually have multiple causes and/or things that plausibly can said to be a cause. What politicians and their friends in the media (and litigators) call “the cause” (or “the direct result,” to use Kessler’s phrase) inevitably will be whatever is in their interest (or the interest of their client) to blame.

As a liberal, Kessler wants to blame the invasion of Iraq for the rise of ISIS. As an opponent of Clinton, Trump wants to blame Obama administration policy. Neither is lying or inventing facts. They are using selective facts to support opinions that serve their interest. At worst, they are spinning.

Keep in mind, too, that assigning a causal relationship between a policy and a result usually requires speculation about what would have occurred absent the policy. Such speculation is more a matter of opinion than of fact.

Would ISIS not have emerged in the absence of the U.S. invasion of Iraq many years earlier? I don’t know, and neither does Kessler. But, as a partisan liberal, it’s in his interest to advance the claim that, but for our invasion of Iraq, there would be no ISIS, and that therefore its emergence is “the direct result” of the invasion.

That’s Kessler’s right. But he shouldn’t be asking the moderator of a presidential debate to advance this partisan position on Monday night.

Even if Kessler’s speculation about the effect of the Iraq invasion is correct, moreover, it is still not inconsistent with assigning responsibility for the rise of ISIS to Obama and Clinton. Whatever is true of the Iraq war, it may well be that ISIS would not have emerged as we know it — i.e., would not have risen to the point of being a serious menace — but for the policies of Obama and Clinton.

In other words, it’s possible that the rise of ISIS depended on both the invasion of Iraq and the subsequent policies of the Obama administration in Iraq (where we removed our troops) and Syria (where we were, in the view of many, too passive). Kessler appears to dismiss this possibility, as one would expect a partisan to do.

There are other reasons why moderators should not purport to “fact check” assertions made by candidates while the debate is in progress. Obviously, it allows the moderator’s bias to enter the proceedings, as Kessler’s claims about the rise of ISIS demonstrate.

But even in the absence of bias, moderator fact-checking is a recipe for mischief. The moderator, however he may view himself, is not omniscient. Rather, he knows only some facts.

Let’s say Candidate A asserts a false fact, the moderator knows the fact to be false, and he corrects Candidate A, thereby making him look bad. Now, let’s say Candidate B asserts a false fact, the moderator doesn’t know the fact to be false, and therefore doesn’t correct the candidate.

Candidate B has received an obvious and undeserved boost from the moderator. It should be the goal of the moderator to boost neither candidate.

My final point is that contemporaneous fact-checking by the moderator isn’t necessary. If a candidate misstates an important fact during the debate, the other candidate will probably call him or her on it. If a particular voter finds the dispute important, he or she will likely find out which candidate was right. An army of fact-checkers is available to assist the voter in this endeavor.

Even if the candidate who misstates a fact isn’t corrected by his or her opponent, the same army of fact-checkers will have its say once the debate is over. Voters who consider fact-checking valuable and reliable will consult the fact-checkers.

Unfortunately, the fact-checking army consists mostly of liberal partisans like Glenn Kessler. Even so, the post debate fact-checking likely will be more reliable and comprehensive than in-debate fact-checking performed by a moderator who has no time to check his own view of the facts and is busy enough trying to moderate the debate.

Despite the mischief associated with in-debate fact-checking by a moderator, I expect we’ll see some of it on Monday. Indeed, I expect we’ll see some of it because of the mischief it can cause."
100071,1009,THERE’S SOMETHING ABOUT HILLARY’S HEALTH,http://www.powerlineblog.com/archives/2016/09/theres-something-about-hillarys-health.php,3,"Readers who have been following the saga of Hillary’s dubious health will remember that Dr. Lisa Bardack is Clinton’s personal physician. At Tom Lifson’s American Thinker site, Jay Michaels gives Dr. Bardack’s letters testifying to Hillary’s good health the kind of close reading that Leo Strauss brought to Plato’s dialogues. Michaels’s post comes with the suitably literary heading “Dr. Lisa Bardack’s Faustian bargain.”

Pursuing a theme we have articulated here several times, Michaels observes: “Unfortunately, Hillary Clinton corrupts everyone who serves her.” (The same observation applies of course to Bill Clinton. They are well matched in that respect.) I don’t have any expertise to bring to bear on Michaels’s post, and I find some of it questionable, but the whole (long) thing is of interest.

100072,1009,THE ECONOMY IN PICTURES,http://www.powerlineblog.com/archives/2016/09/the-economy-in-pictures.php,3,"Paul helpfully noted here Friday the Josh Barro article about why the economic recovery under Obama has been the weakest on record. (Shorter Barro” “It’s the Obama, stupid!”) The good folks at The Daily Shot offer some interesting charts that help visualize the story.

Usually after a recession the housing sector contributes significantly to an economic rebound. This did not happen after the crash of ’08, and as you can see from the first figure below, but the housing sector may be ticking downward just now.  Maybe we built too many houses during the bubble, but even Jerry Brown out here in CA thinks we’re not building enough housing. Meanwhile, manufacturing of capital goods is looking anemic right now after a typical post-recession rebound back around 2010: And repeat after me: The Federal Reserve does not control interest rates. The Federal Reserve does not control interest rates. Repeat as many times as necessary until you understand that the market determines interest rates. The Fed only controls the shortest term interest rates between banks. As the next figure shows, the market is already pushing up interest rates. And almost unnoticed at last week’s Fed announcement that it was standing pat on its short term rates was the fact that the Fed is lowering its economic growth forecasts: Hmm. Starting to look like the next president is going to face a recession. But maybe an American version of Brexit will “trump” all of this (heh—irony deliberate). Someone caught this nice juxtaposition of what the Certified Smart People said about Brexit:"

CNN’s Wolf Blitzer asked Priebus how Trump had prepared for Monday night’s face-off at Hofstra University in Long Island.
“Studying, preparing, going through hypotheticals and what scenarios might come up, but he's very comfortable,” the RNC chair replied. “He did a great job in our primary debates. He's also been through, what, 14 seasons, season finales. He will be prepared. He's always showed up for the big dance, and he will be prepared and he'll be ready to go tonight.”
He's been through 14 taped season finales of a ridiculous reality television show, says Reince, and he sure wiped the floor with all the incompetent not-racist-enoughs we propped up against him in the food fights that passed for our own ridiculous debate nights. That's good enough, right? He'll be fine.

Donald Trump being ready for the presidency because of his status as reality television show star  has long been a long-running joke. It's now being deployed as a serious argument by the head of the Republican National Committee as a reason why the belligerent know-nothing oaf that ascended to the top of their party is not, in fact, the cartoonish insult of self-governance that anyone who is not themselves an idiot or an anarchist believes it to be.

He filmed a reality show, you see. And if they were able to edit together something usable from that, surely he deserves to stand up there and be considered presidential material. What the hell else would we base these things on, if not on who had the best reality shows?

At any point, the Republican Party could have said ""enough."" They could have drawn a line and said beyond this point, we cannot go. They didn't. They wouldn't. And there's apparently nothing left that would inspire such an action—the jokes are real now. This is what they're going with."
100074,1001,Trump's numerous Russia connections put in media Gulag,http://www.dailykos.com/stories/2016/9/26/1574423/-Trump-s-numerous-Russia-connections-put-in-media-Gulag#read-more,4,"Donald Trump has a problem remembering the man he listed as a foreign policy adviser.

Donald Trump, a man who once boasted having “the world's greatest memory,” has suddenly forgotten the role that was to be played by a controversial businessman he named to help guide his foreign policy. ...

Back in March, in a recorded meeting with The Washington Post editorial board, Trump named Page as one of five members of his foreign policy team. …

In July he was spotted at a Moscow law school giving a speech, and Yahoo News reported Friday that during the same trip, Page may have also held private meetings with senior Russian officials. 
That speech that Page gave was one praising Putin while criticizing U.S. foreign policy, and the meetings with Russian officials apparently included offering up slices of Ukraine.

This is just the latest in a string of connections that include Trump’s call for Russia to interfere with the U.S. election, Trump’s frequent praise of Vladimir Putin, Trump’s business connections to Russian oligarchs, Trump’s altering the Republican platform to a position more favorable to Russia … and all that’s aside from Trump’s hiring of a campaign director who was previously directly employed to do Moscow’s bidding. 

You’d think it would be something of a media firestorm. But it’s barely a flicker.

43 days remain until the election. Click here to make sure you're registered to vote. And while you're at it, make sure your family and friends are registered too.

On Friday, investigative reporter Michael Isikoff dropped a bombshell story: U.S. officials are investigating secret meetings between a Trump campaign advisor and Russian officials suspected of trying to influence the presidential election. …

Representatives from the Trump campaign_—_Vice Presidential Nominee Mike Pence, campaign manager Kellyanne Conway, adviser Lt. Gen. Michael Flynn_—_appeared on all five major Sunday shows
Everyone—everyone—got asked about Gennifer Flowers. Only one got asked about Carter Page.

Conway denied that Page was part of the campaign.
And that was the end of it.

Former Gen. Michael Flynn, who has also made multiple visits to Russia and lavished praised on Russia’s state-owned media, didn’t get a single question about Isikoff’s report during his Meet The Press appearance. The rest of Trump’s Sunday morning crew also got a pass.

Another question that appears to be off the table: Trump’s taxes. How much money is actually flowing back and forth between Donald Trump and Russian sources? We don’t know. We can’t know. Because Trump not only refuses to show his taxes (as every other presidential candidate has done for decades), he also won't detail his millions in overseas connections."
100075,1001,Will Donald Trump's lies go unchecked at debate?,http://www.dailykos.com/stories/2016/9/26/1574386/-Will-Donald-Trump-s-lies-go-unchecked-at-debate,4,"Fact-checking Donald Trump was one of the big stories of the pre-debate weekend, but will it be one of the big stories of the debate itself? The Trump campaign is, unsurprisingly, agitating against any fact-checking by moderator Lester Holt. Campaign manager Kellyanne Conway said on ABC’s This Week that:

“I really don’t appreciate the campaigns thinking it is the job of the media to go and be these virtual fact-checkers and that these debate moderators should some how do their bidding.”
Yeah, media, enough with the fact-checking. Just report whatever Donald Trump says, as he says it, with no context or corrections. Literal stenography, that’s your job. And you, debate moderator Lester Holt. If Trump elects to claim during the debate that he has been campaigning as the pro-immigration candidate all along, you are not to do the bidding of the Clinton campaign by pointing out that this is a lie.

You have to wonder what effect it will have on Holt that Trump’s bluster in the lead-up to the debate has included the claim that he would be biased against Trump because he’s a Democrat—when Holt is in fact a Republican. But never fear. This wasn’t a lie, Conway explained, because Trump didn’t actually know Holt was a Republican when claiming he was a Democrat. If the Trump campaign is extending this logic—that you can say anything as long as you don’t definitively know it’s not true—to policy, that explains an awful lot. Willful ignorance is an affirmative defense!

For their part, the Clinton campaign is just hoping Hillary Clinton doesn’t have to spend the entire debate being a one-woman fact-checking team.

“We’re really focused on this opportunity that Hillary has to speak directly to the voters on the issues,” [campaign manager Robby] Mook said in an interview Monday morning. “But we are concerned that Donald Trump may lie, he may throw misinformation out there, and that Hillary will have to spend all of her time trying to correct the record rather than talking about the things she wants to accomplish.”
Among all the things we don’t know about this debate, one thing we do know is that if Trump realizes he won’t be fact-checked by the moderator, he will lie like a warehouse of rugs. It’s up to Lester Holt how that will go."
100076,1002,Analysis: Donald Trump Would Win Election Today Based on Current Polling,http://www.breitbart.com/big-government/2016/09/26/analysis-donald-trump-would-win-election-today-based-current-polling/,4,"NEW YORK CITY, New York — As the first presidential debate looms later Monday evening just an hour from here on Long Island at Hofstra University, a Breitbart News analysis of current polling in the presidential election shows that Donald J. Trump—the Republican nominee for president—would win the election if it were held Monday and the polls are correct.
It takes 270 electoral votes to win the election. With the exception of two states—Maine and Nebraska—the winner of a state wins that state’s electoral votes on Election Day in the general election.

The reliably red Republican states—Alaska, Idaho, Utah, Montana, North Dakota, South Dakota, Wyoming, Nebraska, Kansas, Oklahoma, Texas, Louisiana, Arkansas, Missouri, Indiana, Mississippi, Kentucky, Alabama, Tennessee, West Virginia, and South Carolina—are all expected to easily vote for Trump for president. That totals 164 electoral votes.

Despite initial polling scares during the darkest days of Trump’s campaign in also reliably red Georgia and Arizona, both of those states—per recent polling—have seemingly moved solidly into the Trump column. That’s another 27 electoral votes, for a total of 191 electoral votes with the other red states.

From there, add in Florida with 29 electoral votes. Most recent polling out of Florida—with a couple rare exceptions—has shown Trump with a slight or modest lead. One outlier poll from Monmouth drags the RealClearPolitics polling average in the four-way race between Trump, Democratic nominee Hillary Rodham Clinton, Green Party nominee Jill Stein, and Libertarian Gary Johnson down to a 0.1 percent Trump advantage in the Sunshine state. But the billionaire real estate mogul leads in four out of the last seven surveys, and the only other two where Clinton has any lead it is inside the margin of error. Trump has had a comfortable cushion in Florida since Labor Day, and in the last poll conducted partially before it, he tied Clinton. Assuming Trump can lock down Florida and its 29 electoral votes that he will need to win the White House, and add that to the rest he already has, he then hits 220 electoral votes.

Move from there out to Nevada and Iowa for a total of 12 more electoral votes—six per each state. In the three-way race in Nevada—Stein is not on the ballot in the Silver State—Trump has led in every poll in September, according to RealClearPolitics. During the course of the month, the man whose name is emblazoned across the top of a golden building just off Las Vegas Boulevard has steadily increased his lead from just a point in the first September poll by NBC News, The Wall Street Journal, and Marist, to two points in a Monmouth poll a week later, to three points in the latest two surveys from Fox News and KTNV/Rasmussen. His polling average is a 2.3 percent advantage over Clinton. It is so bad for Clinton in Nevada right now that even Politico ran a headline saying the state is giving Democrats “heartburn.” Iowa is the battleground state where Trump is most comfortable right now. Trump has had a comfortable lead in all three Iowa polls this month—from Emerson, Monmouth, and Quinnipiac—and the RealClearPolitics polling average currently gives Trump a 6.3 percent advantage in the Hawkeye State walking into the debate. Fit Iowa and Nevada in the Trump column and he is up to 232 electoral votes.

Next up is Maine’s Second Congressional District. Maine is one of those two funky states that splits its electoral votes by congressional district—Nebraska, which is solidly in Trump’s column, is the other—and Trump is polling significantly ahead of Clinton there. The only three public surveys done in Maine’s second district—all of which were done in September—give Trump massive leads outside their margins of error. The first, by Emerson, showed Trump with a five-point lead over Clinton at the beginning of the month in a four-way race. A second poll from Colby College/SurveyUSA done mostly after Labor Day gave Trump a ten-point lead, and that finding was confirmed by a later poll from MPRC—a progressive group—that had Trump up 11 points in Maine’s Second District. He was also trending upward statewide, and in the RealClearPolitics average statewide only trails Clinton by 3.8 points. But for now, let’s just give Trump the place that’s firmly in his column—the Second District—and that is just one electoral vote. With that picture, he is at 233 total electoral votes.

North Carolina, another state where Stein is not on the ballot, has seen Trump trend upwards in polling during September. There has not been, according to RealClearPolitics, a single poll conducted entirely in September that has shown Clinton leading in the Tar Heel State. Trump has been leading, or the two were tied, in every three-way race poll since a Quinnipiac poll conducted partially in August and partially in September was released. RealClearPolitics has Trump’s polling average at a 1.8 percent advantage over Clinton in North Carolina, but his most recent poll—from Fox News—put him at a five-point lead there. If Trump locks down North Carolina’s 15 electoral votes on top of everything aforementioned, that puts him at 248 total and in striking distance of the presidency.

This brings us to the all-important state of Ohio. The Buckeye State is another where Clinton has not seen a lead in a public poll since the beginning of September in a CBS News/YouGov poll conducted from September 7 to September 9 that showed her up seven points. That outlier poll, the only one from Ohio this month showing her ahead in the four-way race, drags the polling average for Trump down to a two-point Trump advantage. Every other Ohio poll this month has shown Trump up, including separate Bloomberg, CNN, and Fox News polls that show Trump up five points each. The Suffolk University poll mid-month shows Trump up three, and the new Breitbart News Network/Gravis Marketing survey just out on Sunday evening shows Trump holding onto the lead, up a point on Clinton. CNN’s Jeff Zeleny on Sunday noted that Hillary Clinton has essentially given up on Ohio, saying, “So long, Ohio: It’s been 20 days since Hillary Clinton stepped foot into this classic battleground state, and she’s not expected to visit it again in the month of September.” He said that while Hillary Clinton’s campaign is still spending money there, “Ohio, the mother of all battleground states, is not in her wheelhouse anymore.” If Trump locks up Ohio’s 18 electoral votes, and adds them to everything else, he is at 266 electoral votes. That means he would be one state away from the presidency. From where is it going to come? New Hampshire, Trump’s first primary state win with four electoral votes? Virginia, the Old Dominion from where his opponent’s running mate hails, with 13 electoral votes? Michigan, a blue collar state where American workers are seeing core companies part of their history like Ford move huge chunks of their to business to Mexico, with its 16 electoral votes? Wisconsin, where a bevy of recent surveys have shown a tightened race and from where the Republican National Committee (RNC) chairman and Speaker of the House hail—along with being a stronghold of his former rival-finally-turned-supporter Sen. Ted Cruz (R-TX)—and its ten electoral votes? Or Colorado, ironically the original birthplace of the so-called “Never Trump” movement, which has been, perhaps more than Wisconsin, a thorn in Trump’s side, with its nine electoral votes?

For now, it appears the answer is first and foremost Colorado. The most recent Breitbart News Network/Gravis Marketing survey from Colorado shows Trump up four points over Clinton in the four-way race. The results—with the exception of a mini-surge by Stein, who seems to be taking Johnson’s supporters away—mirror similar polling from Boston’s Emerson College earlier in the month. A CNN poll out Monday morning also confirms a Trump lead in Colorado, as it has him up a point over Clinton. That means two polls from Colorado this month have Trump up by four points, while two other polls—from CBS News/YouGov and Quinnipiac—have Clinton up one and two points respectively, negligible leads inside those surveys’ margins of error. The only reason why Clinton currently leads in the RealClearPolitics polling average in the state—a meaningless lead of 0.2 percent in the spread—is an outlier poll from a couple weeks ago done by Rocky Mountain PBS that showed Clinton up 7 points.

If Trump secures Colorado’s 9 electoral votes, along with everything else considered, he would win at least 275 electoral votes—without even considering Pennsylvania, Wisconsin, Michigan, Virginia, New Hampshire, or even other places where he has been seen trending upwards in polls like New Mexico—on November 8. That’s the ballgame. Of course, this depends on what happens in the four debates. The first presidential one is Monday evening in Hempstead, New York, while next week will see the vice presidential debate in Virginia, and the following two presidential debates, in St. Louis and in Las Vegas, will occur in the next few weeks. The course of public events also play a factor, of course. But the race is Trump’s to lose at this point, if the polls in the battleground states are accurate."
100077,1002,Wire: Donald Trump Ahead of Hillary Clinton in Electoral College,http://www.breitbart.com/2016-presidential-race/2016/09/26/wire-donald-trump-ahead-hillary-clinton-electoral-college/,4,"WASHINGTON, Sept. 26 (UPI) — Donald Trump would earn enough votes to win the presidency in the Electoral College based on UPI/CVoter’s state tracking poll released Monday.
Trump would amass 292 votes and Clinton would get 246 with 270 needed to secure the oval office.

But the candidates’ leads are narrow enough — 5 percent or less — in 12 states to classify them as swing states, meaning 156 electoral votes could be up for grabs.

If the battleground states are not counted, the race would be tied 191-191.

Just two of those swing states could shift to give Clinton easily enough Electoral College votes to win — for example Pennsylvania with 20 votes and Virginia with 13. In this case, Clinton would prevail 272-266.

Each candidate leads in six of the 12 battleground states.

Trump leads in Florida (1.8 percent), Iowa (2 percent), North Carolina (2.5 percent), Ohio (1 percent), Pennsylvania (1.3 percent) and Virginia (3.4 percent).

Clinton is ahead in Colorado (3.5 percent), Michigan (4.4 percent), Minnesota (4.0 percent), Nevada (0.5 percent), New Hampshire (0.9 percent) and Wisconsin (3.4 percent).

Nationwide, Clinton’s biggest leads are in the District of Columbia (66.2 percent) and Hawaii (31.5 percent).

For Trump, his biggest advantages are in Utah (38.4 percent) and Wyoming (36 percent).

All states accept Nebraska and Maine award all of their votes to the winning candidate. Nebraska and Maine allocate two Electoral Votes to the popular vote winner, and then one each to the popular vote winner in each congressional district (two in Maine, three in Nebraska) in their state.

Since the congressional district breakdown wasn’t available, Trump was allocated all of Nebraska’s votes and Clinton earned all of Maine’s votes based on their overall polling in the states.

The poll was conducted Sept. 12-25 among likely voters. The poll is tracking 250 likely voters in each state every week, leading to a state representative sample size of 500 voters. In all, the poll covered about 25,000 samples over two weeks.

Because the poll is conducted online and individuals self-select to participate, a margin of error cannot be calculated. The poll has a credibility interval of 3 percentage points.

In the daily nationwide UPI/CVoter tracking poll released Monday, Clinton and Trump are in a virtual tie. The online poll shows Clinton with 47.81 percent, compared with Trump’s 47.14 percent, a difference of 0.67 percent."
100078,1002,The Clinton Campaign Elbows for an Advantage,http://www.breitbart.com/big-government/2016/09/26/clinton-campaign-elbows-advantage/,4,"Ahead of the first Presidential Debate approaches, the Clinton campaign is working the ref.
Clinton campaign head Robbie Mook tells reporters that NBC’s Lester Holt, the debate moderator, must fact check Donald Trump, as Mrs. Clinton might not have the stamina to both present her own vision of an America moving forward into the future by being stronger together AND respond to Trump’s challenges to her.

Ironically, it can be a little hard to fact check the Clintons.

They’ve been in politics for so long that, as conspiracy theorists often point out, an unusually large number of their past associates are no longer alive. And of course, many of the documents one might use to fact check them have been destroyed.

This election that would include Hillary’s emails and her phones. (And the people managing her emails are all now pleading the Fifth Amendment or asking for immunity from prosecution, so they are legally the equivalent of deleted documents). But it also includes archival government videos and transcripts, which we now know have had patches erased under President Obama, particularly videos and transcripts of briefings at Hillary’s State Department.

Even pre-internet the Clintons were destroying documents.

Bill Clinton’s National Security Adviser Sandy Berger (who passed away last December) was reprimanded for stuffing the original and only copies of documents related to 9/11 down his pants legs to remove them from the National Archives in 2003 and then, presumably, destroy them.

Reminiscent of Hillary Clinton’s “recklessness” with classified documents, Berger claimed he was just “sloppy.” Berger was fined $50,000, gave up his law license, and given two years probation. It’s probably good that Berger’s wife, Susan Berger, a Washington, D.C. real estate agent had helped the Clinton’s buy their $3 million D.C. home on Whitehaven Street in Embassy row (its backyard shares a property line with the Vice President’s mansion at Observatory Circle) in January of 2001 – before 9/11 and before her husband absconded with the 9/11 documents.

Mr. Berger was originally from Millerton, New York, in Duchess County, slightly farther from New York City than the Westchester town of Chappaqua where the Clinton’s own their two other multi-million dollar homes. One Clinton fact that can be checked is one of Hillary’s campaign promises when she ran for and was elected to Senate to represent New York state. She promised to bring 200,000 jobs to upstate New York but instead the region lost 26,500 jobs during her first Senate term.

Hillary’s failure to deliver jobs came up in her 2008 campaign for the White House. She pointed out she had induced one Indian technology company, Tata Consultancy, to open an office in Buffalo, New York. But when reporters investigated further, Tata had only hired 10 employees in Buffalo, and it could not say how many of them were U.S. citizens. Clinton has, however, held several Indian American community fundraisers, one of which produced $3 million for her 2008 presidential campaign.

This isn’t the first time Clinton has been on a now unpopular side of outsourcing jobs to Asia.

Mrs. Clinton, as a lawyer at the Rose Law Firm in Arkansas, was appointed to the Board of Directors of WalMart, partly because the CEO’s wife was campaigning for more women on the Board, and no doubt partly because the Board thought it would be useful for that woman to be the wife of the governor of the state where Walmart is headquartered on (the) board.

Hillary served on the Board of Directors from 1986 to 1992, only leaving when Bill Clinton decided to run for President. While Hillary was on the Board of Directors, WalMart dropped its official Buy American policy, widely criticized by Walmart critics on the left as merely marketing strategy, and began importing cheaper goods from Asia.

A source, gagged by non-disclosure agreements, who says he was in the room when the votes were taken, says Hillary Clinton was the swing vote in abandoning WalMart’s Buy American policy. Hillary has been collecting donations from WalMart executives and its PAC in all her races since.

However, if you’d like to see the minutes of the Board meetings where the vote was taken you can’t. They are as good as Bergered. WalMart doesn’t allow journalists or the public to see its corporate minutes.

So we won’t be seeing them during this election. Or at least, not unless WikiLeaks gets hold of them."
100079,1003,Trump And The Fight For The ‘Soul’ Of The GOP: Coded vs. Uncoded Bigotry,http://www.huffingtonpost.com/dr-milton-mankoff/does-the-gop-need-coded_b_12128840.html?utm_hp_ref=politics,4,"Donald Trump has been a path-breaking Republican nominee for President in so many ways. A flame-throwing billionaire celebrity for many decades, he did not need large sums of donor money to get name recognition and unlimited media exposure.

Trump also serially violated the so-called “11th Commandment” of Republican politics, hurling vicious attacks on his rivals’ appearance, stamina, and character more than their policies, which he generally didn’t seem to know or care about.

He even trashed the GOP’s faux version of history by declaring George W. Bush responsible for 9/11 because he was President at the time and, in a further low blow, called the 2003 Iraq invasion, which he falsely denied supporting, a “big, fat mistake” based on lies about WMDs. (The party’s major candidates have always maintained, despite alleged honest mistakes, we were winning the war until Obama prematurely brought the troops home. It was actually Bush who agreed to remove all U.S. troops.)

As if these crimes against his adopted party were not great enough, Trump has said nothing to indicate he was prepared to cut government spending, privatize Social Security, “reform” Medicare, or take steps to repeal Roe v. Wade.

Despite this odd behavior, Republican primary voters flocked to him, leaving the GOP establishment facing the grim realization that their base was not as enamored of laissez-faire economics, fundamentalist Christianity, and militarism as always assumed. Moreover, they seemed indifferent to their nominee’s probity: Trump has been sued numerous times by those he hired and consumers he likely defrauded and may have committed marital rape.

What did his supporters crave? Turns out, more than anything else, it’s “uncoded” white nationalism, xenophobia and misogyny. Donald Trump gave them that in spades. Code (aka dog-whistle) is political messaging that means one thing to the general population, but something else to a targeted sub-group. Republicans have employed it for fifty years: “states’ rights,” “law and order,” “family values,” “tax and spend Democrats,” and “neighborhood schools.” It was initially designed to discreetly court Southern whites, who had long maintained, and been indulged in the fiction, that Secession and Jim Crow were about “states’ rights,” not defending slavery and later restoring white supremacy. Lyndon Johnson’s assault on segregation gave the GOP a golden opportunity to turn the South red. Republicans then adapted code to appeal to Northern whites who opposed busing children to integrate schools, and Christian fundamentalists against abortion and gay rights.

Lee Atwater, perhaps the most successful campaign strategist Republicans have ever had, succinctly outlined the basic approach in an off-the-record 1981 interview with a political scientist, made available only after Atwater’s death in 1991.

Questioner: But the fact is, isn’t it, that Reagan does get to the Wallace voter and to the racist side of the Wallace voter by doing away with legal services, by cutting down on food stamps?
Atwater: You start out in 1954 by saying, “N-gger, n-gger, n-gger.” By 1968 you can’t say “n-gger” — that hurts you. Backfires. So you say stuff like forced busing, states’ rights and all that stuff. You’re getting so abstract now [that] you’re talking about cutting taxes, and all these things you’re talking about are totally economic things and a byproduct of them is [that] blacks get hurt worse than whites. And subconsciously maybe that is part of it. I’m not saying that. But I’m saying that if it is getting that abstract, and that coded, that we are doing away with the racial problem one way or the other. You follow me — because obviously sitting around saying, “We want to cut this,” is much more abstract than even the busing thing, and a hell of a lot more abstract than “N-gger, n-gger.”
Code has been used for so long that many of the oldest Republican politicians, if not disingenuous, have seemingly forgotten what it was; naive younger ones may believe it simply expresses conservative political philosophy, not bigotry.

So, to some of these people, the Trump campaign was quite a shock. A small minority have been unwilling to come on board or are still undecided. A handful of conservative pundits, notably George Will, David Brooks and William Kristol (though he brought us Sarah Palin) revile Trump, and George H.W. Bush, Mitt Romney, Jeb Bush and John Kasich are among the well-known Republicans who share this contempt. But the overwhelming majority of self-identified Republican voters now support the nominee.

What is the long-term significance of Trump’s campaign for the Republican party and code? If Trump wins, its use will probably decline and bigots will be even more energized. Unless he is pulling yet another scam, this time on voters who trusted his rhetoric, they will also be empowered to some extent. Trump himself is too ADHD to develop a comprehensive legislative agenda, use his Executive powers to institutionalize bigotry, or even vet appointees with that outlook. Perhaps he doesn’t even care about governing; only ruling. Regardless, he will be surrounded by aides and hangers-on who will do the “right” thing and have their own pernicious agendas.

On the other hand, if Trump loses, which still seems most likely, but hardly certain, there will be a crisis within the GOP political class. If the election is a nail-biter, there might be intra-party challenges of those whose endorsements of the “nominee” were without enthusiasm, as well as “traitors,” such as Kasich and Susan Collins, among others, who refuse to support him. Whether purges would succeed is unclear, because the donor class never warmed to Trump; poorly funded opposition to incumbents typically fail. In this case, code will co-exist with Trumpian prose and be deployed where required.

If Trump is routed, on the other hand, the GOP will still need to appeal to his base, but code has always sufficed. There is no strong evidence his open embrace of bigotry in the campaign for the nomination mobilized many “low-propensity” voters. Research indicates 88 percent of his supporters voted Republican in the 2012 general election. Moreover, even if Trump recruited a small proportion of new voters to the GOP ranks, he may have turned off as many who had been Republican stalwarts, and unintentionally mobilized first-time voters for Democrats. Lee Atwater approves this message."
100080,1003,"Starving The Beast: Trump, Taxes And The Politics Of Unanticipated Consequences",http://www.huffingtonpost.com/timothy-j-barnett/starving-the-beast-trump-_b_12188020.html?utm_hp_ref=politics,4,"The year was 1996. Republicans running for the U.S. Congress felt pressure from Ross Perot’s impressive campaign for the U.S. Presidency in 1992: an effort that garnered Perot 19% of the presidential vote. Now, instead of running as an independent candidate, Perot was running under the banner of the Reform Party: a third party that Perot hoped to turn into a national competitor. Feeling the competitive heat, Republican congressional candidates attempted to copy elements of the Perot campaign, but from their advantaged position within a major party. Young conservatives took up the chant for immigration constraints, job security for Americans in manufacturing industries, a balanced budget amendment, and the paying down of America’s national debt.

Channeling Perot in late 1999, Donald Trump attached himself to similar goals in forming a presidential exploratory committee. Doing things in a signature way, Trump proclaimed a centerpiece economic policy of paying off the national debt. Trump claimed that the debt of $5.7 trillion could be retired by means of a one-time tax of 14.25% on the assets of Americans with a net worth of at least ten million dollars (an idea that if delicately implemented might have saved the country from some of its economic inequality and the financial turmoil of 2008). Trump’s calculus was that once the national debt was retired, the $200 billion a year saved on interest payments could provide middle-income tax cuts while shoring up Social Security—a populist notion.

As the year 2000 arrived, some political cynics believed that Trump was trying to buy the U.S. presidency by potentially sacrificing several hundred million of his own wealth to his proposed one-time asset tax. Whether the Trump strategy revealed deep political integrity or shallow political ambition was up for debate. Regardless, Americans did not seem to understand the rationale of Trump’s proposed asset tax on the super-wealthy—an idea that stands in stark contrast to Trump’s fiscal policy notions today. Paradoxically and ironically, many Americans seemed to think it was a trick of some sort, or a miscalculation that would undermine the favorable effects of trickle-down economics, or perhaps an affront to the American tradition of unfettered economic liberty. Whatever the case, Trump’s bid failed to gain traction, resulting in his exploratory committee closing shop after a few months.

Starving or Feeding the Beast?

Backtracking to 1996, many of the Republican Reagan Revolutionaries who won congressional seats in the tidal wave election of November 1994—the election that ended forty years of Democratic control of the U.S. House—were feeling their oats as first-time incumbents. Following the example of Mark Neumann of Wisconsin, they plied their wares of balanced budget proposals, using charts and graphs Perot-style. Still feeling the sting of their near miss on a balanced budget amendment in 1995 (passed by a vote of 300 to 132 in the House but falling one vote shy in the Senate), they hoped to regain momentum on the plan in the 105th Congress. Then, a strange thing happened. Wise guys from conservative think tanks like the Heritage Foundation descended upon Capital Hill to convince Republican legislators to change course. By doing the opposite of balancing the budget—increasing spending in targeted areas while reducing federal taxes—government that had drifted Left could be deprived of revenue, thus “starving the beast” (a partisan play on words that caricatures Thomas Hobbes’ Leviathan).

As rumored in the Republican conference, the superiority of the “starve the beast” strategy was the magic of cutting Democratic programs while advancing largess for Republican interests. Why cut pork away from your own supporters? Why not reduce the footprint of federal government at your opponent’s expense? If politics is about power, and political right is less about light than the crafty use of might and fright (Machiavellianism), why not load costs on the opposition’s ledger while securing benefits for your own? If justice is not about fair opportunity and earned deservedness, then boundaries are non-existent: the public good is a matter of rhetoric and spin. Democrats could appreciate this logic as well as Republicans: it’s just that the blue team didn’t own Congress at the time.

“Starve the beast” never starved big government as intended. It undermined support for a balanced budget amendment, deflecting the energy to watered-down congressional legislation known as the Balanced Budget Act of 1997. That Act, like many other budgetary shenanigans, did little to impede the growth of the national debt from under $5.7 trillion dollars in 2000 to over $19.3 trillion today (a stunning 150% increase in national debt since 2000 after adjusting for inflation). An academic analysis of starve the beast strategies suggests that these grand schemes grow the beast rather than starve it—evidenced in the fact that six of the ten highest income counties in the U.S. (out of more than 3,000) surround the nation’s capital. Strategies of this stripe survive because of their rhetorical appeal and promise of asymmetrical winnings (i.e., exploitation).

Crude Oil and Unintended Consequences

The politics of unintended consequences is not unique to the United States. Consider the trouble OPEC’s elites are bringing upon themselves, at least according to some theorists. As one leading argument has it, when the new technology fracking boom made it possible for the U.S. to nearly double its domestic oil production between 2008 and 2015 (thus providing economic lift-off power for the Obama administration), the Saudis feared a sizeable loss of global market share. As the world’s largest and best financed low cost oil producer (both cash costs and capital costs) the Saudis believed they would emerge the winners from any protracted oil price war. Hence, they set upon a strategy of jaw-boning about production caps to keep the price of oil in the right price strata: high enough to supply sufficient revenues for the kingdom while low enough to “starve the beast” of new era oil production in North America. Hence, a dollar trading range for crude oil in the forties per barrel. It is here that unanticipated outcomes emerge.

Instead of the U.S. oil production collapsing, U.S. producers have found ways to enhance business efficiency, cut costs and eliminate waste. The huge cost advantage the Saudis enjoyed over the U.S. in the fall of 2014 is now rapidly narrowing. This applies not only to field oil extraction but offshore, too: deepwater and shallow water. Ironically, the longer OPEC and Russia dally around before cutting their production to secure higher global oil prices, the narrower their oil production cost advantage will become. Inadvertently, the Saudi strategy is forcing western producers to improve their game. Now, many American oil field discoveries that appeared only marginally worthwhile will be developed quite fully and profitably. While the Saudis were trying to starve future American oil production, they’re busy feeding it instead. By analogy, this is the politics of unanticipated consequences.

The Unmanageable Future of Democracy

Currently, both major political parties in America are shepherding crafty plans to benefit their side at the expense of the other. What neither side sees is that in trying to kill off the blue beast or harpoon the red beast, their protracted and intense internecine warfare is moving the country toward a politically unmanageable condition and away from the shared public good. Each side stoops to whatever political tricks or maneuvers will cloud the reputation or prospects of the other. The unanticipated but growing likelihood is that political legitimacy will be trampled well before 2030. Opinion leaders like capricious children are now confounding oppression with liberty, and conflictual rights with human rights. In the rising political cacophony, almost anything can happen. Can democracy be managed when ideological diversity is on steroids, mutuality is draining out, and trust in leaders is all but gone? What happens when people tire of working together to solve problems?"
100081,1003,Why ‘Stopping Trump’ Isn’t Enough,http://www.huffingtonpost.com/steven-g-brant/why-stopping-trump-isnt-e_b_12202546.html?utm_hp_ref=politics,4,"I am writing this to say that — while the election of Donald Trump would be a disaster for America and the world — preventing his election is NOT enough.

Yes, America’s political system is on fire right now. The truth is going up in smoke. While all politicians have shaded the truth from time to time, just about the only time Donald Trump tells the truth is when he says “My name is Donald Trump.” And even then, there’s the whole Drumpf-thing.

Legendary journalist Carl Bernstein made this “nonexistent truth” point extraordinarily clear, when he said on Sept 18th on CNN that Trump was getting away with a COVERUP of who he really is... and that the media must stop letting him do this! (Can you spell TrumpGate?) But there’s a larger point I want to make. Stopping Trump will put out the fire that a President Trump would consist of. We CANNOT have a President of the United States who is a pathological liar! But there is a much larger, anti-truth fire burning across the American socio-political landscape... one that’s been burning for decades, if you believe the research Al Gore did (and I do) when he wrote The Assault On Reason in 2007.

Whether Trump becomes president or not, we run the risk of this larger, anti-truth fire destroying the social fabric of our country.

They say that a problem well understood is a problem well on the way to being solved. Well, here’s an essay I wrote in 2010, in which I detailed the problem. I called this anti-truth challenge a virus back then, and urged President Obama to be the nation’s “truth doctor”. Maybe that will happen after he leaves office. Would certainly be a worthwhile thing for a former-president (and Star Trek fan, by the way) to do... because he could not just help people learn the truth about the Assault on Reason... he could help people learn the truth about How Much Better Society Can Actually Be. That’s where his love of Star Trek comes into play.

You see, while there is an “assault on reason” in which people like Trump try to convince us that “up is down” (global climate change was made up by the Chinese) and “good is evil” (America’s history of welcoming immigrants must stop); there is also a “coverup” (whether intended or accidental) of the truth about how much better our world could be if we fully implemented the improvements possible in society that have been figured out by the world’s leading sustainable science experts (such as McDonough - Braungart and Amory Lovins) and the world’s leading win-win based conflict resolution and innovation / collaboration experts (such as the Harvard Project on Negotiation and W. Edwards Deming).

What does this have to do with Star Trek? Well — if you combine the work of McDonough, Braungart, Lovins, Deming and an number of others (especially including Buckminster Fuller, whose pathbreaking work with Gerard Piel, the Founder of Scientific American, pretty much kicked off the sustainable development movement in the 1960s before the term “sustainable development” even existed) — you get the beginnings of a pretty clear and detailed road map to WORLD PEACE....

... the kind of world peace Star Trek shows us we can have in the future once we all learn to be excited about diversity instead of afraid of it... and once we figure out that it’s possible to feed, clothe, house, and educate everyone on Earth (eliminating scarcity, which is the root cause of war).

Here’s Buckminster Fuller talking about this option in a video that also shows astronaut Buzz Aldrin playing The World Game, which Bucky developed to help people learn to solve problems based on the assumption of abundance rather than scarcity... This is why I say stopping Trump isn’t enough. We’ve got to get the truth out about (a) the larger anti-truth fire that’s been burning a long time and (b) the HUGE TRUTH about how much better our world can be thanks to advances in the (hard) sustainability sciences and the (soft) conflict resolution sciences.

What a wonderful world it could be! And once enough people know just how wonderful.... that critical mass of humanity will demand they be given that world by their leaders!

We have the ability to create a world in which everyone can (as Mr. Spock would say) Live Long And Prosper. Let’s put out the fires that are burning. And then lets build a new world!"

""If somebody would call up Sean Hannity, before the war started, he and I used to have arguments about the war. I said it's a terrible and stupid thing, it's going destabilize the Middle East and that's exactly what it's done,"" Trump said during the debate.

As debate moderator Lester Holt tried to correct Trump's insistence that ""the record shows otherwise,"" Trump launched into a long diatribe about his record.

""Should not show otherwise. The record shows that I'm right,"" Trump said. ""When I did an interview with Howard Stern, very lightly, first time anyone has asked me that, I said lightly, I don't know, maybe, who knows, essentially. I then did an interview with Neil Cavuto. We talked about the economy, it's more important. I spoke to Sean Hannity which everybody refuses to call Sean Hannity. I had numerous conversations with Sean Hannity at Fox.""

Trump lamented that no reporters ever call Hannity to ask him about those conversations, but after the debate, Hannity granted Trump a one on one interview.

""Do you know how many times we had conversations about that? And you told me I was wrong in fairness. You did tell me over and over again I was wrong. And we had passion. But it was a respectful debate,"" Hannity said after the debate.

""It was respectful but I understood where you were coming from. I thought it would destabilize the middle east. I didn't know it would be managed so poorly. But I felt it was something that had to be discussed because I was against the war in Iraq,"" Trump responded.

We will see if any other reporters reach out to Hannity per Trump's suggestion. Stay tuned."
100083,1004,Trump Campaign Adviser Steps Down While Disputing Claims Of Russia Ties,http://talkingpointsmemo.com/livewire/carter-page-steps-down-from-campaign,4,"One of Donald Trump's foreign policy advisers said Monday he was stepping down from the campaign, while pushing back on allegations that he had engaged in private communications with top Russian officials.

Carter Page said in an interview with Washington Post columnist Josh Rogin that the claims were ""just complete garbage,” but nonetheless he had chosen to take a leave of absence from campaign become the accusations were causing a ""distraction.""

Page decision came on the heels of a report by Yahoo News Friday that U.S. intelligence officials were looking into whether he met privately with Kremlin-aligned Russian figures while on a trip to Moscow in July.

""There’s so little time between now and the election, this is in the best interests of the candidate. It’s so ridiculous I want to have it behind us,"" Page told the Washington Post.

Page was first publicly attached to the Trump campaign by Trump himself, in a March interview with the Washington Post, when the candidate listed Page among his foreign policy advisers. The campaign has since wavered on exactly how involved Page actually was in advising Trump. Trump spokeswoman Hope Hicks said last month that Page was an ""informal advisor"" who did not speak for the campaign, while spokesman Jason Miller said he had ""no role"" in the campaign when asked about him by Yahoo News last week.

According to Rogin's reporting, Page had never met with Trump one-on-one nor was he deeply involved in drafting speeches. However, Rogin described him as ""an early member of the team who was working with Sam Clovis,"" a policy adviser who joined the Trump campaign in 2015.

Page told the Washington Post that he didn't meet with any of the Russian figures -- including officials in the Kremlin and allies of Putin -- mentioned in reports about the U.S. probe into his Russian activities.

“It’s completely false and inconceivable that someone would even accuse me of that,” Page said. He said that while in Russia, he did meet briefly Russian Deputy Prime Minister Arkady Dvorkovich, but that the introduction was merely an exchange of pleasantries. Page also said that he made clear while he was in Russia that he was not there on behalf of the Trump campaign, and that when he sought approval for the trip from the campaign's senior staff, it was made clear that no campaign issues would be discussed.

Additionally, Page sent a letter Monday to FBI Director James Comey, requesting the agency to terminate any investigation into his Russian travels.

""As you may be aware, the source of these accusations is nothing more than completely false media reports,"" Page said in the letter. ""Yet for the record, I have not met this year with any sanctioned official in Russia despite the fact that there are no restrictions on U.S. persons speaking with such individuals."""
100084,1004,Trump Wants Credit For Not Bringing Up Bill Clinton's Sex Scandals In Debate,http://talkingpointsmemo.com/livewire/trump-clinton-sex-scandal,4,"Donald Trump claimed he stopped himself from saying something that he described as ""rough"" during Monday night's debate, which, judging from comments from him post-debate, were linked to former President Bill Clinton's sex scandals.

During a debate question about comments Trump has made about women, Trump began defending himself, and confessed to the audience that he had begun to say something ""extremely rough"" about the Clintons and then stopped himself.

""You want to know the truth, I was going to say something extremely rough to Hillary, to her family and I said to myself, I can't do it,"" Trump said. ""I just can't do it.""

While many speculated on what that could mean, Trump seemed to drop another breadcrumb, during an interview with Fox News' Sean Hannity after the debate, saying that he was going to bring up ""what's been going on in their life"" but stopped himself because of respect for Chelsea Clinton, who was in the room.

""I didn't want to say her husband was in the room along with her daughter, what I think is a very nice young lady and I didn't want to say what I was going to say about what's been going on in their life,"" he said. ""So I decided not to say it. I thought it would be very disrespectful to Chelsea and maybe to the family.""

Later, Yahoo News's Hunter Walker asked Trump if he thought about bringing up Clinton's sex scandals, and Trump confirmed that he thought about it and that he held back for Chelsea's sake.

""I was, but I decided not to out of respect for Chelsea,"" Trump said."

It's the clearest sign yet that when Trump says climate change is a ""hoax,"" he means to turn that assertion into a centerpiece of his environmental policy as president.

Trump has tapped Myron Ebell, a leading climate change denier, to lead his EPA transition, according to the Climate Wire and other outlets. Ebell is the director of the Center for Energy and Environment at the Competitive Enterprise Institute, a libertarian think tank funded by the Koch brothers and oil and gas companies. (The organization also orchestrated the latest legal challenge to the Affordable Care Act in 2015.) He also chairs the Cooler Heads Coalition, a group that questions ""global warming alarmism.""

In selecting Ebell, Trump is sending a clear signal that, if elected, he would drastically roll back progress in addressing climate change. Ebell has called President Barack Obama's Clean Power Plan ""illegal"" and the Paris Climate Accord a ""usurpation of the Senate's authority."" Any small increase in global temperatures, he has said, is ""nothing to worry about.""

In addition to Ebell, Trump has selected Mike McKenna, a lobbyist for the energy industry, to lead the transition at the Department of Energy. According to Politico, McKenna has ""ties to the industry-backed American Energy Alliance and Institute for Energy Research"" and ""lobbied for the Dow Chemical Company, Southern Company and Koch Companies Public Sector.""

There seems to be skepticism that Trump would actually implement some of his most outlandish proposals, from mass deportation of undocumented immigrants to walking away from NATO allies. But when it comes to making his belief that global warming is ""bullshit"" into national policy, Trump appears to be moving full-steam ahead."
100086,1005,What Did Donald Trump Say on the Iraq War and When Did He Say It?,http://www.motherjones.com/politics/2016/09/every-position-donald-trump-iraq,4,"Of all the myths of Donald Trump's presidential campaign, few are as enduring as his claim to have opposed the war in Iraq from its inception. Trump used his alleged opposition to the invasion as a bludgeon in the Republican primary, tearing down challengers such as Jeb Bush and positioning himself as a prescient foreign policy thinker. Since winning the nomination, he's repeatedly attacked Hillary Clinton for supporting the war. And he again insisted that he opposed the invasion during Monday's presidential debate.

The problem is that there's no evidence that Trump voiced his opposition to the war like he says he did; the only statements he gave prior to the invasion were supportive of it. And his own explanations of his position have in turn opened up even more contradictions in his record.

Here's a quick guide to Trump's various position on the war:

""I'm no warmonger. But the fact is, if we decide a strike against Iraq is necessary, it is madness not to carry the mission to its conclusion. When we don't, we have the worst of all worlds: Iraq remains a threat, and now has more incentive than ever to attack us."" (Trump's 2000 book, The America We Deserve)
""Yeah, I guess so; I wish the first time it was done correctly."" (Interview with Howard Stern, 2002)
""Either you attack or you don't attack."" (Interview with Neil Cavuto, 2003)
""Well, he has either got to do something or not do something, perhaps, because perhaps shouldn't be doing it yet and perhaps we should be waiting for the United Nations, you know. He's under a lot of pressure. He's—I think he's doing a very good job."" (Same interview)
""I think Wall Street's waiting to see what happens but even before the fact they're obviously taking it a little bit for granted and it looks like a tremendous success from a military standpoint and I think this is really nothing compared to what you're gonna see after the war is over."" (Fox News, one day into the 2003 invasion)
""Look at the war in Iraq and the mess that we're in. I would never have handled it that way. Does anybody really believe that Iraq is going to be a wonderful democracy where people are going to run down to the voting box and gently put in their ballot and the winner is happily going to step up to lead the county? C'mon. Two minutes after we leave, there's going to be a revolution, and the meanest, toughest, smartest, most vicious guy will take over. And he'll have weapons of mass destruction, which Saddam didn't have."" (Esquire, 2004)
""How do they get out? You know how they get out? They get out. That's how they get out. Declare victory and leave. Because I'll tell you, this country is just going to get further bogged down. They're in a civil war over there, Wolf. There's nothing that we're going to be able to do with a civil war. They are in a major civil war."" (CNN, 2007)
Trump's evolution on Iraq tracks closely with that of many Americans. As the Washington Post has pointed out, his public criticism of the invasion coincided with the broader shift in American public opinion on the war's conduct. But as he mounted his bid for the presidency, Trump began to tell a very different story—that of a lone truth-teller. Last September he said that his debate audience could find ""25 different stories"" on his opposition to the invasion of Iraq, and he introduced a new bit of drama that had not been disclosed previously: Trump's vocal criticism of the march to war in the press had so unnerved President George W. Bush that he sent a delegation to Trump Tower to calm him down.

""We should have never gone into Iraq,"" he told Fox News in 2015. ""I've said it loud and clear. I was visited by people from the White House asking me to sort of could I be silenced because I seem to get a disproportionate amount of publicity. I mean I was very strong: 'You're going to destabilize the Middle East.'""

At a Republican debate in February, he reiterated his position, bragging that his outspoken statements of dissent were particularly noteworthy because he was only a private citizen. ""I'm the only one on this stage that said, 'Do not go into Iraq, do not attack Iraq,'"" Trump said. ""Nobody else on this stage said that. And I said it loud and strong. And I was in the private sector. I wasn't a politician, fortunately. But I said it, and I said it loud and clear, 'You'll destabilize the Middle East.' That’s exactly what happened.""

But when he was confronted with his 2002 comments on Howard Stern (Stern: ""Are you for invading Iraq?"" Trump: ""Yeah, I guess"") later that month, Trump seemed at a loss. ""I really don’t even know what I mean because that was a long time ago and who knows what was in my head,"" he told Chuck Todd.

Trump continued to talk up his Iraq opposition on the stump, though, and by the time he was confronted with his 2002 comments again in May, by Fox News' Bret Baier, he had a (slightly) more fluid response. ""I'm talking to Howard Stern, weeks before, the first time anybody had ever asked,"" he said. ""And don't forget, I was a civilian. The first time anyone ever asked me about the war, about should we go in, because it was a question, are we going in? And I said very weakly, 'Well, blah, blah, blah, yes, I guess.'""

By June, Trump had locked up the nomination, but he still hadn't offered up any of the supposed two-dozen articles that he claimed would vindicate his claim of having opposed the war from the start. He told CNN's Jake Tapper that there were plenty of articles attesting to his criticism from 2004 and on (true) and said of the infamous Stern interview, ""even that, it wasn't like, 'oh yeah, we should go in.' It was a very, like, 'yeah, maybe.'""

Trump has still never produced an article or an interview from before the invasion that back up his claims of ""loud and clear"" criticism. And in recent months, surrogates have excused the absence of evidence by noting that Trump was just a simple businessman—so of course no one asked him. But in September, Trump threw yet another explanation into the mix. He did speak out—he just did it in private phone conversations with Sean Hannity.

""I spoke to other people and if you look also…speak to Sean Hannity, who's a terrific guy by the way, speak to him, and he and I used to have arguments about the Iraq War,"" he said to Fox News' Howard Kurtz. ""As, you know, Sean wanted—he believed in the Iraq War and, you know, that's—that's what his belief was. We used to have arguments about it, big arguments, and you could speak to Sean and that was before the war started.""

In an ideal world, at least one major-party candidate would have opposed the greatest American foreign policy disaster of the last half century. But as someone once said, you go to war with the army you have."
100087,1005,Donald Trump's Unreal Debate,http://www.motherjones.com/politics/2016/09/donald-trump-unreal-debate-hofstra-university,4,"One of the sharpest moments of the first debate between Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump came when the former secretary of state told him, ""I know you live in your own reality."" In fact, the 90-minute-long slugfest was a clash of realities. When Clinton pointed out that Trump believed climate change is a hoax perpetuated by the Chinese government, he said this was false. But it's actually what he had said. When moderator Lester Holt pressed Trump on his racist birther crusade, Trump again tried to pin birtherism on Clinton and said that he dropped the issue after President Barack Obama produced a long-form birth certificate. That wasn't true. Asked about race relations in the United States, Trump propounded on the need for ""law and order"" and declared the murder rate in New York City has gone up. No, not so.

This was a battle of two views of the world. In Trump's world, America is experiencing a historic crime wave and it ""loses on everything."" The nation's leaders have not done anything to fight terrorism. And he opposed the Iraq war from the beginning and ISIS began under Obama and Clinton because they pulled US troops out of Iraq. None of this is true. He also proclaimed, ""My strongest asset...is my temperament."" At best, that's' a—no pun intended—debatable point.

The major difference between Clinton's and Trump's worlds was put on display at the outset. In Clinton's opening question—responding to a question about the economy—she mentioned about a dozen policy proposals: investing in manufacturing, boosting clean energy programs, raising the minimum wage, equal pay for women, profit-sharing for employees, paid family leave, affordable child care, debt-free college education, ending corporate tax loopholes, increasing taxes on the wealthy, and more. Trump spent his opening moments railing against China and Mexico and decrying jobs ""being stolen from us."" It was Clinton the policy wonk promoting nifty ideas to make the nation stronger versus Trump the angry man blaming foreign enemies and vowing in strongman fashion that he will somehow get results.

These are two different ways to consider the nation's current predicaments and ponder possible solutions. And the fact that (so far) the electorate is closely divided between the two suggests a deep cleavage in the body politic: Trump voters are from Mars, and Clinton voters are from Venus. Immediately following the debate, CNN pundits (that's what was on the television screen at the media filing room where I was) pronounced the debate a win for Clinton, and instant focus groups backed them up. She was calm and knowledgeable; Trump could not control his excesses. (He defended having called Rosie O'Donnell a ""pig""! He practically admitted to not paying taxes. He explained stiffing contractors by saying they did crappy work. He falsely claimed that Clinton's 2008 campaign sent a reporter to Kenya to investigate Obama's birth. He conceded he exploited the housing market crash that triggered an economic collapse, noting, ""That's called business."") Clinton prevailing was a fair assessment, but the question is: does it matter? Trump is a candidate who vents. Facts don't matter to him. They may not matter to many who want to send an angry bully to Washington to beat up all those elitists there.

Before the debate, I spoke to a senior Trump surrogate who told me the Trump campaign was quite pleased with recent developments: ""His message, his themes are being heard. It's working. We're connecting. People are giving him due consideration. People are angry. He just needs to stick to these themes and messages."" And his themes are memes: law and order, bring our jobs back, she's low-stamina, make America great again. Do these transcend the nitty-gritty of the debate and the usual political discourse?

Clinton surrogates point out that despite whatever happens in this debate—and perhaps in subsequent face-offs—her campaign remains focused on organization: Virginia, Colorado, Pennsylvania, Ohio. The campaign's message to fellow Democrats has been: don't wet the bed, we're plodding ahead with the tough work of politics. In other words, it's not about memes, it's about boots on the ground (and online). So the debate performance, while important, would not be determinative. That's a fine theory.

Prior to the debate, I had an odd moment with retired Gen. Michael Flynn, Trump's top national security adviser and supporter. He was standing in the spin room in the media center. He said he had no time to chat, so I tossed him an easy and conventional question: what does Trump have to do this evening? Trump, he said, ""needs to show those people not paying attention who Donald Trump is."" And who is Trump? Trump ""resonates,"" Flynn said, because ""he comes across as a very honest guy against someone who is not honest.""

Trump as honest? Honest when he says he knows more about ISIS than the generals? Honest when he talks about....well, check out this list of recent Trump lies and whoppers. Of all the ways a surrogate can support Trump, declaring him honest is not serious. (And, yes, Clinton has told her own whoppers, but any reasonable fact-checking of this debate will find that Trump mugged the truth so much more than she did.)  I didn't quite know how to follow up Flynn's assertion. It was as if he had said the sky is purple. Does he truly believe Trump's top character trait is honesty? But this did bring home the point that life on Planet Trump looks quite different than life in the rest of the universe.

This election is not about which candidate has better policies or even better qualifications. It's about how voters see the world. Is the dress white and gold or blue and black? Clinton did appear to have a better night than Trump. But it also seems that much of what's going on in this campaign is not open to debate."
100088,1006,Debate wrap-up: Does a draw go to the challenger?,http://hotair.com/archives/2016/09/26/debate-wrap-draw-go-challenger/,4,"Donald Trump and Hillary Clinton met on the debate stage for the first time tonight … and neither one scored a knockout. Trump used the trade debate to dominate Hillary in the first thirty minutes, Hillary seized the momentum in the second thirty minutes, and the final third was a mixed bag. Hillary barely mentioned Vladimir Putin, and Trump never mentioned Benghazi. It was an evening of sharp banter and missed opportunities, but in the end, both candidates remained standing.

What does that mean? In our debate analysis below, I argue that it benefits Trump more. Supposedly Trump was going to have trouble keeping up with Hillary’s grasp of policy, and that was true at moments, but Trump didn’t get eclipsed enough to matter. Keeping pace with Hillary, and especially putting as much pressure as he managed in the first thirty minutes, puts him at the same level as Hillary in the eyes of voters. She needed to completely outclass Trump in order to make the point that he’s not up to the task of the presidency. Instead, she kept him in the ballgame, even with a bizarre last-minute attack about Trump’s treatment of a beauty-pageant contestant, an attack that fell flat a few months ago when Team Hillary tried launching it the last time.

How about Lester Holt? He’s getting pounded on Twitter, but he did a credible job for the most part. Holt got into an extended argument over Trump’s positions on the Iraq War, but otherwise stayed out of the mix except to attempt to enforce time limits. The questions provoked both candidates into personal exchanges. If Holt interrupted Trump more than Hillary, it’s only because Trump interrupted Hillary and ran over time limits more often. Those who worried about a Candy Crowley moment can breathe a sigh of relief; Holt didn’t change the trajectory of the debate, or the race.

Bottom line: I don’t expect to see a significant change in polling trajectory from this debate — and considering the current momentum, that’s good news for Trump. Team Hillary needed him to fall on his face, and they didn’t get that. That should have them worried, because in this case, the draw goes to the challenger rather than the quarter-century Washington champion."
100089,1006,Hillary’s Mook can’t answer why staffers referred to ‘Hillary Cover-up’ operation in emails,http://hotair.com/archives/2016/09/26/hillarys-mook-cant-answer-staffers-referred-hillary-cover-operation-emails/,4,"Friday’s FBI document dump (since when do federal investigators dump information on Fridays as if they were politicians) included a treasure trove of new information connected to the investigation of Hillary Clinton’s use of a non-secure, unauthorized, non-government email server to conduct government business while she was Secretary of State.

One of the more fascinating exchanges included staffers referring to something called the “Hillary Cover-up” operation, which the Washington Examiner explains involved the deletion of multiple emails around the same time congress was asking for the same emails to be retained:

Employees at Platte River Network, the firm tapped to manage Hillary Clinton’s emails in 2013, sent emails describing the ‘Hilary [sic] coverup [sic] operation’ after Clinton’s staff asked them to begin wiping emails in Dec. 2014.
On Sunday’s State of the Union on CNN, host Jake Tapper asked Clinton campaign manager Roby Mook to explain why staffers would refer to the opertion as a “cover-up plan.”  His answer is… well… it’s not an answer at all: JAKE TAPPER, CNN: There was a document dump on Friday where we learned from the FBI that an I.T. contractor managing Hillary Clinton’s private e-mail server made reference to the “Hillary coverup operation” in a work ticket.

He used that after an aide asked him to automatically delete emails after 60 days. This I.T. worker thought he was covering something up, no?

ROBBY MOOK: I’m glad you asked this question. A lot of this stuff is swirling around out the ether. It’s important to pull back and look at the facts.

The FBI did a comprehensive and deep investigation into this and at the conclusion of that, FBI Director Comey came out and said to the world that there was no case here. That they did not have evidence of wrongdoing on Hillary’s part.

TAPPER: So what’s the “Hillary cover-up operation” that the I.T. worker was referring to?

MOOK: This is the perfect example of what’s going on here. The Republicans in the House are selectively leaking documents for the purpose of making Hillary look bad. We asked FBI to release all information they shared with the Republicans so we can get the full picture.

Again I would trust the career professionals at the FBI and Justice Department who looked into this matter, concluded there was no case [more] than I would Republicans who are selectively leaking information.
See? There wasn’t a cover-up. And if there was a cover-up, it was the Repulican’s fault. Or something.\"
100090,1006,Which Donald Trump will show up tonight?,http://hotair.com/archives/2016/09/26/donald-trump-will-show-tonight/,4,"After all the years I’ve spent watching American politics and the ebb and flow of elections, I tend to turn a jaundiced eye toward over-hyped events such as tonight’s debate which everyone is describing as a make or break moment in the campaign. But that’s not the case today. We’ve reached a rare confluence of events which will, I believe, have the future of this race ready to shift drastically one way or the other. After one of the more contentious primaries we’ve ever seen and a summer of nasty trench warfare between the two major party candidates, along with GOP infighting which has still not entirely evaporated, this could truly be the show of shows. As we’ve covered here endlessly, the polls have closed in recent weeks to the point where the contest stands on a knife’s edge. Current estimates show that as many as 80% of registered voter will be tuning in, and many of them have not yet made up their minds or are open to changing sides.

One of the biggest questions of the day is whether or not Lester Holt, in his first attempt at moderating such a contest, will choose to be a referee or a judge. (CNN Money)

The Commission on Presidential Debates has some advice for debate moderators this fall: leave the fact-checking to the candidates.

The Trump campaign is taking the same position. So are some former moderators, like Jim Lehrer, who has facilitated twelve presidential debates.

But many others — including a wide array of journalists — want the man moderating Monday night’s debate, Lester Holt, to intervene if egregious lies are said on stage.

As a result, fact-checking, normally a pretty staid subject, is now the focus of a roiling debate in political and journalistic circles.
The only real question to be answered, at least for my money, is which Trump will show up, because there have most assuredly been two Donalds out there on the campaign trail from time to time. When he’s in his comfort zone and not trying to cram himself into a box designed by professional campaign managers, Donald swings for the fences and enthusiastically broadcasts a glowing, if somewhat ill defined vision for a future of American excellence. This leads to some questionable or even cringeworthy moments to be sure, but it also fires up those willing to take a chance on the newcomer.

That’s the Donald who is most beloved by his supporters, but there have also been times when Teleprompter Donald shows up. You can tell when he’s spent a bit too much time listening to veteran campaign staffers or the various pundits who regularly declare his campaign a disaster. That’s when Teleprompter Donald steps up and focuses on not making any more “mistakes” providing the chattering class with fresh ammo to unload on him. It’s a safer route, but at the same time that’s not what the audience paid to see. Teleprompter Donald doesn’t excite anyone. So which will it be and how will the GOP nominee handle the opportunity to face down Clinton directly for the first time?

I was watching Morning Joe today and they had Donna Brazile (the recent replacement for Debbie Wasserman-Schultz) on as a guest. She was exuding the usual confidence which any good Democratic spokesperson is required to muster, but her opening comment on the debate really caught my attention. After describing Donald Trump as a “disruptor” who can climb up and “shake the tree” in such a contest, she said that the most important thing for Hillary Clinton to do was to make it about the future.

I’d have to agree with her sentiment, but good luck with that. Obviously Hillary would love to have the debate be all about the future. Most candidates would because that allows them to speak exclusively of their own plans and leave it to the audience to guess how well such a strategy might work out. But Hillary Clinton isn’t a candidate of the future. For her it’s all about the past, and if Donald Trump is one tenth the competitor I believe he is, that is what will be under discussion for most of the night. It could be the recent past (e-mail scandal, failed relations with other countries, pay for play at the Clinton Foundation) or the distant past (Hillarycare, young black men as super-predators or anything to do with her husband). Clinton has essentially zero accomplishments to point to and a closet full of skeletons which less engaged voters may be only dimly aware of. This is a target rich environment for Trump and if he’s truly ready for this fight he will be giving the country a tour of Clinton World which will leave Hillary stumbling for explanations.

If that happens, Katie bar the door. Particularly if Clinton demonstrate any signs of weariness or fatigue, this could tip over the entire table. Of course, with Trump being Trump, he could also find a way to make it blow up in his face. I’ll be firing up the popcorn and waiting to see. This should be a moment in history you’ll want to tune in for."
100091,1007,Eric Trump’s Debate Advice To Donald: Just Be Yourself,http://www.youngcons.com/eric-trump-advice-to-donald-just-be-yourself/,4,"It’s debate night in America and most people believe tonight will be most watched television event in political history.

Every political pundit is trying to predict how the debate will go down and everyone seems to have an opinion on what Donald Trump should do.

Eric Trump has some advice for his father about how to act tonight.

And it’s solid…


From Townhall:

When asked by a Fox News Sunday morning show what it would take to win the debate, Trump said his father just needs to “be himself.”


“He’s talking to working-class Americans who have been left behind by career politicians—and that’s exactly who Hillary Clinton is,” Trump said.  “We’re disrespected all over the world. In China, President Obama literally had to come out of the service entrance of his plane.”

“You can’t just script these things, you kind of have to go out there and feel the moment.  I think that’s the problem with most politicians,” Trump said of his unique tactics.  “We have to start winning again.” Tough to argue with that.

I mean, why not?


Being himself has gotten him this far when no one on the planet thought he could survive all the controversy.

You get the feeling that Trump is really confident heading into the debate.

Hillary?

Not so much…"

But this is not going well for her…"
100094,1008,"D-Day, September 26: Stand and Deliver",http://www.americanthinker.com/articles/2016/09/dday_september_26_stand_and_deliver.html,4,"Not since the invasion of Normandy has a national event been considered more crucial to the outcome of a strategy than the first presidential debate between Hillary R. Clinton and Donald J. Trump tonight.

For weeks now, pompous pundits have been weighing in with advice for both candidates.  Nobody knows whether these ""experts"" have ever so much as stood on a debate stage, but apparently that's not a critiquing criterion.

Panels on the subject begin with a question like ""What do Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump have to 'do' in the debates?""  Well, for starters, they have to stand up for 90 minutes.  This task may prove harder for Hillary than for her adversary.  On the other hand, The Donald may find it tough to stand up to the salvos of a more seasoned debater.  And, of course, neither contender can stand the other.

This animosity only heightens anticipation.  Viewers are switching from Monday night football not to observe a love fest.  They will most certainly expect some blood to be spilled on the political gridiron.  Once the game kicks off, neither player will be permitted to take a knee.  We'll look for tackles and touchdowns.  And while this contentious bit of political entertainment comes free of charge, viewers will nevertheless demand their money's worth.

Hence the advice about how the candidates can put it all together – from the same crowd of critics, incidentally, who will pull them all apart afterward.  Doesn't it occur to these sages that putting pressure on both presidential wannabes may not be the wisest thing to do?  But politics is a blood sport, and the debates are like the playoffs.  On Election Day, only one of the candidates will go away with the winner's trophy.

The high volume of advice from talking heads can be boiled down to a few common caveats for each candidate.  Donald Trump has gotten the lion's share of admonitions, because, according to the election scene gurus, this first debate will be his make-or-break moment.  Presumably, if he doesn't ""pull it off,"" he might as well pull out of the race.

On the other hand, everyone seems to agree that the bar for Trump has been set very low.  I'm not sure why this is, since he has managed to catapult his candidacy into a neck-and-neck battle with his more experienced opponent.  By now he has figured out how to speak forcefully before various groups, most often before large groups of well-wishers.

But a debate is very different from a rally.  The teleprompters will be gone, and so will the wildly supportive audience.  Those attending the debate venues are advised not to express any enthusiasm for either candidate.  This rule, however, can prove as effective as the designation of a mall as a ""gun-free zone.""

Still, in a debate environment, Trump will no longer find himself basking in the presence of partisans, and he will miss their energizing feedback.  Certainly, nobody would accuse the debate moderators of being plucked from the infamous basket of deplorables.  In spite of these negatives, Trump's main challenge will be to somehow look and act ""presidential.""

The Donald may have excelled in the Republican primary debates, where he shared the stage with as many as 14 other contenders, but he will now find himself under greater scrutiny, sharing the spotlight with only one adversary , who is determined to annihilate him with her political savvy.  The worst threat, according to those in the know, is that she will try desperately to get under his thin skin.

So what advice do the political veterans have for the beleaguered Republican standard -bearer?  Basically this: Stay calm and carry on.  Keep focused and on message.  This would be far easier if only he knew the questions in advance!

Then there is Hillary.  She didn't have to face the same ordeal during her primary debates.  In fact, ironically, the only thing Secretary Clinton had to do in those performances was to keep her cool and seem credible – the same advice that is now being given to her Republican challenger!

Even at that, Hillary had some tense tussles with Bernie Sanders, especially in her final primary debate.  But she had the advantage of knowing from the start that she was the indisputable presumptive Democratic nominee.  As a result, the debates did not matter all that much.  Now they do.

The outcome of this presidential scuffle could well come down to two critical issues: knowledge and temperament.  Hillary's ""job"" is to show Americans that Trump is lacking in both.  A lot has been said about how she intends to goad her opponent into losing his famous temper.

But if in so doing she opts to examine Trump's baggage – both personal and professional – he may well decide to crack open hers.  The debate stage could become figuratively littered with the dirt of foundations, deals, debts, and defaults, not to mention The Donald's marriages and Hillary's handling of Bill's bimbos.  Voters may insist they want candidates to stick to the issues.  But we're only human – and we hate being bored.

As for Hillary, one wonders if she's really clever enough to insult Trump into bad behavior.  He's brash; he's blunt; he's not always wise.  But he certainly isn't stupid.  Hillary may be better off concentrating on the improvement of her own delivery woes: a shrill, faltering presentation and a sanctimonious tone that leaves a lot of listeners cold.

Still, she has been gushing about how she cannot wait to debate Donald Trump.  Bring it on!  Back in 2008, Joe Biden may have had the same cocky anticipation before he faced Sarah Palin in their only vice presidential debate.  Afterward, the omnipresent critics declared the contest a tie, which translated into a Palin win.

As soon as the debate ends, the rhetoric will switch to Tuesday morning quarterbacking.  Barring something bizarre, the event will likely pass into memory.  And having been there, the audience for the second presidential face-off will be much diminished.  If the anticipated fireworks fizzle, even the pundits will have to find some other place to park their advice.

Obvious answer: No.  The reporter isn’t reporting, and journalism is merely a ruse.  What’s being undertaken is propaganda.  No exaggeration.  Propaganda, it is, and mainstream media practitioners are “propagandists.”  It’s high time to brand both as such and make it stick.

So you’re thinking this is much adieu about nothing.  Generally, the public has been onto the MSM for years.  Politico just ran a story: “Opinion of Media Never Worse.” 

The article led with:

Record numbers of Americans consider the news media to be “immoral,” “inaccurate,” and “biased,” a new poll says.

A plurality of Americans, 42 percent, said that the press was “immoral,” compared with 38 percent who viewed the news media as “moral” — a record high according to an annual Pew Research poll on the media.

But follow the link in the Politico article to the Pew Research analysis.  You’ll find this tidbit:

While the press’s overall reputation in many areas has declined, majorities continue to say that news organizations care about how good a job they do (62%) and are highly professional (57%). However, these evaluations also have slipped somewhat since 2007.  

The Pew Research study is a decidedly mixed bag.  Clearly the public is suspicious but ambivalent about the MSM.  Majorities want to give the MSM the benefit of the doubt.  Our side’s task is to persuade more folk that the MSM’s intent is ill, and their motives are contrary to what authentic journalism is about… that the MSM serves a master, and hoodwinking news consumers is critical to their service.

The Hillary-Trump contest is – to date – the apex of propagandizing for a side.  Is there any need to cite chapter and verse?  Just scan the front pages of the New York Times and Washington Post.  Or tune into MSNBC or CNN.  Prime example: Clinton’s evident health problems are given short shrift – with a “nothing to see here” shrug – and then swept away.

But bias for Hillary is beyond flackery.  The MSM is shilling for much more than a candidate.  Hillary’s just a vessel.  The MSM works for a worldview and agenda that overarches any given election.  The point of electing Hillary has nothing to do with fondness for her (it’s scant among the MSM), or any belief in her virtues (they’re justifiably suspect).  Hillary, corrupt?  Doesn’t matter.  It matters that she’s elected to further the “remaking of America”… to consolidate and advance a leftist agenda… to, not incidentally, keep the ins, in, with all the money, power, access, and influence that attends.

Does the MSM care that Hillary, suffering health problems, is elected and possibly compromised in her duties as president?  That with the nation facing critical issues and compelling threats and challenges, she could be incapacitated or – heaven forefend – die in office?  It’s a cynic’s game.  Husband Bill or Tim Kaine is as capable – more so, actually – of getting the right results.  The names change, but the game remains the same.        

The MSM are serving a regime (Rush was brilliant in his labeling the Obama administration as “The Regime”).  The regime – statist in makeup – has aspirations and aims, and must have control to achieve its ends.  Propaganda is a tool for control, in its acquisition and retention.  The MSM is an organ of the regime.   

The left has long grasped that words and language matter; they shape thinking that shapes action.  The right, not so much, with some exceptions.  Years ago, again Rush very artfully and vividly began labeling the MSM the “drive-by media.”  But the Republican establishment (predictably) and, yes, the conservative establishment have failed to take up Rush’s lingo.  Undignified.  Too conflictual.  Unlike Democrats and the left, which rarely have a problem sharing blunt language and spreading it far and wide.   

Sure, the GOP establishment complains about “media bias” at times, doing so in measured language.  The conservative establishment isn’t hesitant to criticize, though more typically tries to indict the MSM through description and voluminous supporting evidence.  Well and good, but the MSM isn’t being tried in a court of law.

The arena is the public, wherein voters reside.  Reason alone won’t sway most folk.  You’ve got to appeal to their emotions; you need to paint a simple and stark picture: the MSM are the black hats – shills for one side trying to trick average folk with omissions, half-truths, and outright lies.  No one wants to be duped, and that’s the MSM’s Mission # 1: playing news consumers for fools.

Long about the 1960s, something called “advocacy journalism” took root, which is a concoction of the left.  No less a source than Wikipedia has this to say about the practice:

Advocacy journalism is a genre of journalism that intentionally and transparently adopts a non-objective viewpoint, usually for some social or political purpose. Because it is intended to be factual, it is distinguished from propaganda. It is also distinct from instances of media bias and failures of objectivity in media outlets, since the bias is intended.   

The MSM is all about advocacy.  That part about advocacy journalism distinguishing itself from propaganda is gobbledygook; its misinformation, a head fake.  How often have the facts about Democratic misrule and liberal policy failures in Detroit motivated the MSM to put a glaring light on the gross breakdowns there and call out the perpetrators?  Facts aren’t getting in the way of the MSM’s “nonobjective viewpoint.”

The MSM is much more inclined to inform us that stubborn historical and institutional racism account for Detroit’s miseries.  And there’s just not enough taxpayer money spent and government provided to help the poor blacks of the Motor City.  Or… [Fill in the blank, so long as it doesn’t indict Democrats and liberals].

Of course, someone is bound to cherry-pick MSM reporters who shoot straight.  Big deal.  It’s not the few, but the many, who define the profession – and the profession (that includes publishers and editors) is about propagandizing.  The MSM serves one party and one worldview.

Changes have occurred in the news marketplace over the years, welcome changes.  Thanks to cable, the internet, social media, and technologies, the stranglehold that the MSM enjoyed on news dissemination is no more.  Consumers do have more choice.  But the MSM’s market share is still too great and it needs to be slashed.   

Further delegitimizing the MSM is the means; marginalizing them is the end.  Tagging them propagandists is one way to make that end happen.

100096,1008,Behind the Clinton Immunity Deals,http://www.americanthinker.com/articles/2016/09/behind_the_clinton_immunity_deals.html,4,"We now know that the Justice Department granted immunity to at least five of Hillary Clinton's close aides during the FBI's investigation of her email scam.  However, it's hard to understand, in light of the ultimate disposition of the case, why Justice gave these people immunity.  Representative Jason Chaffetz, whose committee has the herculean task of cleaning the Augean Clinton State Department stables, revealed the previously unpublicized immunity deals.  He was quoted as saying of them, ""[N]o wonder they couldn't prosecute a case"" referring to the FBI and Justice Department.

In fact, in normal circumstances, Chaffetz is exactly wrong.  Immunity deals are granted precisely to prosecute a case and, in the absence of utter corruption, would never be issued unless prosecutors had other more valuable targets they intended to put away in return for letting some of the smaller fry go.  That this did not happen in the Clinton email case is another factor that makes the decision so utterly fraught.

Just as unusually, the five immunized witnesses apparently were not required to cooperate with federal authorities or with Congress in return for their deals, other than providing a limited amount of immunized information.  In the case of Mills and Samuelson, it was evidently their laptops.  Clinton apologists insist that in return for partial cooperation, the witnesses were granted only limited immunity.  Even assuming that this was true, the FBI never acted thereafter in any way, shape, or form to put these witnesses at risk of prosecution.  Incredibly, they were permitted to share joint counsel (so that each knew what was being asked of the others during FBI interviews), and both Mills and Samuelson, immunized witnesses in the case, were permitted to attend Hillary's July interview by the FBI and join her gaggle of attorneys!

All this raises the question of why the Justice Department granted immunity at all.  If, as it now seems certain, neither the Justice Department nor the FBI had any actual interest in investigating the case with the object of filing criminal charges against Hillary or her legion of aides there would be little or no apparent reason to grant anyone immunity.  You don't need the cooperation of witnesses involved in a criminal conspiracy if you have no intention of unwinding that conspiracy and prosecuting those behind it.

Here is one halfway coherent solution.  In the autumn of 2015, the FBI investigation of Hillary's home-brew email server gained some steam as it became apparent that she had deceived the State Department, the FBI, and the public as to the nature and extent of her document mishandling and destruction enterprise.  It also raised the extremely serious possibility that even more was going on besides a massively corrupt and illegal attempt to hide potentially embarrassing personal documents that tied Hillary to pay-for-play schemes, money-laundering, and influence-peddling related to the Clinton Foundation.  With her private server and upwards of 30,000 emails professionally destroyed (allowing little or no recovery), the FBI had to put to bed the possibility of deliberate espionage – that is, whether Clinton, her aides, or all of them were also involved in a massive foreign spy operation.  

The Justice Department apparently granted Brian Pagliano, Clinton's chief I.T. guy in charge of setting up and shutting down the server, limited immunity in December 2015, the others sometime thereafter. 

It is now abundantly clear that Comey and his minions within the FBI were willing to live with typical Clinton venality and corruption.  But counter-espionage is probably the FBI's most important function, and Comey could not ignore what must have appeared to be the very real prospect that Hillary was running or had been duped into running a serious and treasonous foreign intelligence scheme against the U.S. government.  For the FBI to overlook this, should it turn out to be true, would threaten not only the country, but obviously the careers and livelihoods of Comey and his boss, Loretta Lynch.  Plus, Comey's evidently quite successful suppression operation against dissent within the FBI to his philo-Clinton shenanigans would probably become unmanageable if the Clinton server, the email destruction, the lies, and the secrecy were mostly or in part facilitating a deliberate foreign intelligence penetration of the U.S. government, as opposed to run-of-the-mill Clinton corruption.   

Thus, the FBI had to get to at least a scintilla of the truth in the case, enough to assure itself that Hillary's scheme was merely another case of Clintonian vice, and that Hillary and her aides had not become outright agents of a hostile foreign power.  In order to figure this out, they needed to talk to the key players, which explains the immunity deals and the people chosen – those closest to Hillary and with the most connection to the email destruction, where critical evidence of foreign involvement would have been most evident.

It is also quite likely that Comey and Lynch let Bill and Hillary Clinton know that the immunity deals were not a way of delving into their corrupt practices or to establish grounds for prosecuting the same, but rather to reassure the government that there was nothing else going on.  Either that or the unusual nature of the deals themselves made that clear.  That explains the equanimity of the Clinton camp during the FBI probe right up to the end. 

When Comey declined to charge Clinton, he explicitly rejected the possibility that espionage was behind the email scheme, something he could not vouch for unless his agents had convincingly determined that such was not the case.  He implied that the servers were probably hacked, but this fell into Comey's broad definition of ""extreme carelessness,"" which he used to improperly and dishonestly exonerate Hillary of prosecutable crimes.

Comey satisfied himself and his boss Lynch that Clinton was not a foreign agent engaged in active espionage against the United States, and having done that, he wasn't interested in pursuing the matter further, no matter how many other crimes the scheme involved.  In that regard, the immunity grants served their purpose, both for the FBI and Hillary.  And if Hillary is so inclined, this presents a great campaign slogan: ""Hillary – Dishonest and corrupt, but only for herself.""

100097,1009,OBSERVATIONS ON TONIGHT’S DEBATE,http://www.powerlineblog.com/archives/2016/09/observations-on-tonights-debate-2.php,4,"For those who didn’t watch my live commentary on tonight’s debate–that would be most of you!–here are my thoughts.

1) The first half hour was great theater. The moderator left Trump and Clinton alone, like a referee who lets boxers fight it out. The candidates went back and forth, for a while seeming to validate Trump’s suggestion that they might not need a moderator. Trump did very well in this segment, and the subject mostly under discussion, the economy, was vital.

2) The debate went badly downhill in the middle third, with a succession of irrelevant topics–Trump’s business ventures, birtherism, and Trump’s tax returns. My guess is that a lot of undecided voters tuned out.

3) It is astonishing that in over an hour and a half, the moderator never uttered the word “immigration.” Immigration is Trump’s signature issue and perhaps the one on which he enjoys the widest margin of popular support. The issue can’t be ignored in debates two and three, which will be to Trump’s benefit.

4) In general, both Clinton and Trump performed as expected. Hillary dodged a bullet, in the sense that she didn’t have a coughing fit or appear overly fatigued. Tonight we saw Hillary at her best, but this is basically the Hillary that the American people have known for a long time and don’t like. Trump likewise was Trump, for better or worse. He had good moments, especially early on, but during the last third of the debate the people around me were begging Trump to just stop talking. He was frequently incoherent, and he needs to get better at deflecting irrelevancies and changing the subject to favorable terrain. How in the world did he wind up talking about Rosie O’Donnell?

5) There will be lots of discussion about who “won” the debate, and it is easy to say that the winner–the better performer–was Mrs. Clinton. But asking who won the debate is the wrong question. The question is, did watching the debate make undecided voters more likely to vote for Clinton or Trump? My guess is that in that sense, the event was pretty much a draw, and we won’t see much movement in the polls over the next few days.

6) This is why I don’t think the evening was a bad one for Trump: most undecided voters will have seen Hillary as the embodiment of the political class. Smug, smirking, always ready with a torrent of words that can’t quite obscure the fact that to the extent she herself has wielded power, she has been a failure. Hillary Clinton is a walking exemplar of the political class that got us where we are now. A viewer who thinks America is doing great, our politicians are terrific, things have been going well in recent years and we need more of the same will be motivated to vote for Hillary.

But there aren’t many such voters. By a 70%-30% margin, voters think we are on the wrong track. Those who think America is in decline, our political class is corrupt and incompetent, and we need a change will not be motivated to vote for Mrs. Clinton. On the contrary, however inept he may have been at times, Trump did make it clear that he is the voice for change in the race. That may be a lot more important than “winning.”

Round one is in the books, and I doubt that it changed much. We will find out, as polls come out in the days to come."
100098,1009,THOUGHTS ON AN UNPLEASANT EVENING,http://www.powerlineblog.com/archives/2016/09/thoughts-on-an-unpleasant-evening.php,4,"Well, that was fun — watching two candidates I can’t stand argue for 90-plus minutes and seeing the candidate I dislike more (Hillary Clinton) get the better of it.

Why do I think Clinton got the better of it? First, I thought she was more composed. Second, I thought she was on the attack for much of the debate and was able (with the help of the moderator) frequently to put Trump on the defensive.

Third, I thought that Trump often wasn’t effective when on the defensive. His defense of his “birtherism” was effective when he laid the origins of it on Clinton, much less so when he praised himself several times for getting Obama to produce the birth certificate, and quite ineffective when he couldn’t explain why he didn’t back off once the certificate was produced.

Trump did even worse when he tried to explain why he won’t produce his tax returns. I doubt that a good answer is available, but surely Trump’s rambling defense was less than optimal. Better to give a short answer — e.g., it’s not a good idea to release tax returns when being audited — and move on.

So too with the issue of Trump’s support, pre-invasion, of the Iraq war. Instead of droning on and “swearing in” Sean Hannity as his witness, why not just say that I expressed my opposition on several occasions, while Hillary, with access to all the intelligence reports, voted for the war.

This was one of several occasions when Trump failed to zing Clinton. Here’a another. The question of electronic espionage presented a great opportunity for Trump to hammer Clinton on her use of a private server to receive and transmit information about our national security. Trump didn’t do it.

Trump had good moments, to be sure. He was effective, I thought, on “law and order,” winning that part of the debate in my estimation. In my view, he also won on ISIS (where I generally agree with him) and trade (where I generally don’t). And he did a good job of hammering home the fact that Clinton has been a central figure in the political class that has failed to come to grips with many of our most serious problems.

Where he lost was mainly on personal stuff — his tax returns, birtherism, sexist comments, and stiffing his creditors. The debate, thus took an unexpected turn — Trump did pretty well on the issues but lost when it came to personal attacks. Fortunately for him, the first 30 minutes — presumably the most watched part of the debate — were focused on issues. The personal stuff came later.

How badly did Trump lose that part of the debate? I think he avoided coming off as an ogre, except to people already convinced he is. If the bar is that low, he cleared it. His temperament, for which he vigorously vouched, didn’t seem awful, but Clinton’s seemed better.

I think Trump also cleared a low bar on showing himself knowledgeable enough to be president. Not because his answers were good on substance, but because he was never stumped, committed no terrible gaffe, and was able to throw around facts and figures.

But Hillary Clinton also cleared a few bars. She did not seem sickly or lacking in stamina (and she had a very good response to Trump’s claim that she does lack it). She certainly did not seem intimidated by Trump or less formidable than the tycoon — at least not to me. If anything, by putting Trump on the defensive (with the moderator’s help), she arguably was the more formidable of the two candidates, and without resorting to bluster.

But what did the public make of the debate? That’s the only important question, one that will be answered in the next few days.

"
100099,1009,DEBATES THEN AND NOW,http://www.powerlineblog.com/archives/2016/09/debates-then-and-now.php,4,"If you want to know just how crazy things are, consider that Hofstra University, host of tonight’s debate, has posted a “trigger warning” outside because some Hofstra students might find the content of the debate traumatizing. And just who do you think will do the triggering? I suppose if Hillary collapses on stage (is Lloyd’s quoting odds, or any Las Vegas bookmakers taking bets?) I suppose liberals will be traumatized, but I’m sure the thinking is that Trump might say something mean.

Meanwhile, I was surprised to learn that the record largest debate audience is still the 1980 debate between Reagan and Jimmy Carter—and that was back when the country’s population was about a third smaller than it is today. I’m not quite sure what is the methodology that leads everyone to predict that tonight’s debate will have a record audience of around 100 million (versus 80 million in 1980) beyond the obvious fascination with Trump, but I think one parallel is obvious: in 1980, lots of undecided or tentative voters wanted to know if Reagan was the madman the media made him out to be. But once he said, There you go again. . . it was all over. Voters decided that he was safe after all. Which suggests Trump has the most room in this debate for a breakout. Hillary is well known, and people don’t like her. She’s the “safe” choice if Trump is a loon. If people decide Trump isn’t crazy, he’s going to gain out of the debate. I expect he might say something like this with a smile: “Given your record in office, I think the voters ought to say, ‘You’re fired.'”

There are other ways this debate might be an echo of 1980.  Here’s my account of it from The Age of Reagan, and you can make out parallels and similarities for yourself:

For the media, it might as well have been the Super Bowl. Walter Cronkite introduced the debate by saying, “It’s not inconceivable that the election could turn on what happens in the next 90 minutes.” Carter won the coin toss, and opted to let Reagan answer the first question, which turned out to be about war and peace. Carter’s strategists believed that Reagan might be nervous and stumble out of the starting gate. Reagan was a little halting and hesitant, but got out a pre-planned answer emphasizing that “our first priority must be world peace,” and including his refrain about having seen four wars in his lifetime and not wishing to see another. Lou Cannon quipped that “Reagan mentioned ‘peace’ so often it sounded like he had invented the word.” Reagan soon settled into a relaxed rhythm for the rest of the debate, accomplishing his most important objective: he reassured viewers that he was not a “mad bomber.”

            Carter, on the other hand, appeared stiff and uptight throughout. Washington Post columnist Mary McGrory wrote: “Carter seemed stricken with nerves, so tense that he looked affronted when Reagan bounded over to shake hands before the hostilities began.” Carter hit Reagan hard on Reagan’s “out of the mainstream” views, and six times used the adjective “disturbing” to describe Reagan’s policies. Conversely, Carter kept saying “Oval Office” as though he thought viewers might have forgotten that he was President. Reagan parried effectively, though a strict scoring of the debate would have awarded Carter points for consistently putting Reagan on the defensive.

            The public, of course, does not judge presidential debates by careful scoring of points and counter-points. The demeanor and bearing of the candidates counts as much, if not more, than the substance of the debate. The relaxed and confident Reagan showed some of his quickness and instinct for the cut and thrust of debate, especially during the argument over his economic plan. Carter repeated his charge that it would be inflationary. Reagan answered with a rhetorical question that focused viewers on his broader philosophical point about government: “I would like to ask the President why it is inflationary to let the people keep more of their money and spend it the way they like, and it isn’t inflationary to let him take that money and spend it the way he wants?” Reagan also hoist Carter by his own petard. In 1976, Carter had blasted Ford with the “misery index,” the combination of inflation and unemployment. In 1976, Carter’s “misery index” was 12.5, and Carter had said “that no man with that size misery index had a right to seek reelection to the presidency.” Today, Reagan observed, the misery index is over 20.

            Carter never did loosen up. One of Carter’s own aides observed that in the TV cutaway shots showing Carter while Reagan was speaking, “Jimmy looked like he was about to slug him.” Carter’s one attempt at humanizing himself was a disaster. About two-thirds of the way through the debate, at the close of several questions about foreign policy and arms control, Carter said: “I had a discussion with my daughter Amy the other day, before I came here, to ask her what the most important issue was. She said she thought nuclear weaponry, and the control of nuclear arms.” Reagan’s line about having sons and a grandson had gone over fine, but Carter’s line, delivered in a rapid-fire staccato burst, landed with a thud, and became a source of ridicule against Carter over the next week. Republican groups were quick with a bumper sticker: “Ask Amy, She Knows.”

            Carter then unwittingly set up one of the most famous lines of Reagan’s career. “Governor Reagan,” Carter charged, “began his political career campaigning around this nation against Medicare,” and now Reagan was opposing any steps toward national health insurance. The camera swung to Reagan for his reply. Reagan nodded his head at Carter, and said with a slight smile: There you go again. Reagan’s formal answer that followed didn’t really matter. There you go again seemed to sum up both Reagan’s easy-going character and the overreach of Carter’s relentless attacks on Reagan’s supposed extremism. It may well stand the test of time as the most memorable line of any presidential debate. (The Washington Post transcript of the debate curiously omitted “There you go again.”)

            But Reagan saved his toughest blow at Carter for the end. In his closing comment, Reagan said:

Next Tuesday all of you will go to the polls, will stand there in the polling place and make a decision. I think when you ask that decision, it might be well if you ask yourself, are you better off than you were four years ago? Is it easier for you to go and buy things in the stores than it was four years ago? Is there more or less unemployment in the country than there was four years ago? Is America as respected throughout the world as it was? Do you feel your security is safe, that we’re as strong as we were four years ago? And if you answer all those questions ‘yes,” why then, I think you choice is very obvious as to whom you will vote for. If you don’t agree, if you don’t think that his course that we’ve boon on for the last four years is what you would like to see us follow for the next four, then I could suggest another choice that you have.

David Gergen had suggested these lines to Reagan, and it was a devastating closer. Reagan, who had answered the first question, got in the last word.

            Carter’s camp believed they won hands-down. “We won, we won,” Hamilton Jordan said immediately after the TV lights went down. So did much of the media, if only slightly. Hedrick Smith’s lead in the New York Times news story the next day said that “The Presidential debate produced no knockout blow, no disastrous gaffe and no immediate, undisputed victor,” though Smith gave the edge to Carter further down in the story. “If anyone gains politically from the Tuesday night matchup,” Morton Kondracke wrote in The New Republic, “it will be Carter. . . [B]y every measure except aw-shucks niceness, Carter was the clearly superior performer.”

            The viewing public didn’t think so. Wirthlin conducted an overnight poll of 500 voters that found Reagan judged the winner by a two-to-one margin. Other polls by Lou Harris and the Associated Press found a similar result. The most controversial spin on the debate came from ABC News, who promoted a call-in phone poll after the debate on “Nightline.” Bell Labs, which facilitated the phone poll, expressed “shock” when over 600,000 people phoned in over the next hour, at a cost of 50 cents per call. The tabulation found Reagan the winner, again by a two-to-one margin. This self-selected phone-in “poll” was utterly unscientific and drew heavy criticism that it was no more accurate than the Literary Digest telephone poll in 1936 that predicted Alf Landon would defeat Franklin Roosevelt. Nevertheless, the poll took on a life of its own and received wide news coverage. (And Bell Labs made $300,000 on the deal.) “Whatever the poll’s shortcomings,” the New York Times suggested, “a margin that wide probably reflected something of substance about the debate’s impact.”

            The Times was right, though it didn’t become clear until 48 hours before election day. Wirthlin’s tracking polls, based on more than 10,500 phone calls in the week after the debate, detected Reagan’s numbers moving up steadily, but public polls continued to find the race still to be within the margin of error—too close to call. Gallup reported the Sunday before the election: “Never in the forty-five year history of presidential election surveys has the Gallup poll found such volatility and uncertainty.” Pat Caddell’s daily tracking poll on Sunday found Reagan and Carter dead even, as did the New York Times/CBS poll. Caddell told Elizabeth Drew Sunday night, “I just wish we hadn’t debated.”

Wouldn’t surprise me at all if the course of the rest of this election hears a lot of echoes of this."
100100,1010,Trump campaign promises his willpower is enough to boost the economy and shield the deficit,https://thinkprogress.org/trump-trade-paper-932b40c6507d#.lkf67sou3,4,"Trump’s advisers are promising that the candidate’s policies will give economic growth a huge bump, while also claiming his proposals won’t add to the federal deficit. All of this will be achieved with a key ingredient: sheer willpower.
Peter Navarro, an economist at UC Irvine, and Wilbur Ross, a billionaire investor, both advisers to the campaign, released a new report offering their own analysis of Trump’s economic policies. They promise an annual economic growth rate of 3.5 percent, far higher than what the U.S. has seen in the last decade or what is forecast for the future.
And they argue that the candidate’s trade policy alone would generate three-quarters of the revenue growth that would be needed to make the tax package deficit-neutral.
How would Trump achieve these goals? Just by showcasing how strong he is.
The Tax Foundation recently found that price tag for Trump’s tax plan was $2.6 trillion over a decade, although only assuming he follows through on taxing real estate and law firms at a higher rate_—_something he has not clarified_—_and baking in usually unrealistic assumptions about tax cuts spurring the economy. Navarro and Ross’s report claims that the biggest driver of increased government revenues to make up for that cost will be trade, coming up with $1.7 trillion out of a total of $2.4 trillion over a decade.
The paper also claims that Trump will revive millions of manufacturing jobs. But while trade policies have been found to have significantly reduced those jobs, that doesn’t necessarily mean a shift in policy will quickly or easily bring them back. The industry has also become much more efficient, relying on fewer workers to get the same things made.
When it comes to China manipulating its currency or deploying unfair trade practices, which Trump’s advisers say have hurt economic growth, they claim the country will simply back off of its tactics with Trump in the White House. “Our view is that China’s leaders will quickly understand they are facing strength on the trade issue in Trump rather than the kind of weakness on trade that has characterized the Obama-Clinton years,” Navarro and Ross write. “Just as these Chinese leaders have been exploiting American weakness by cheating in the trade arena, they will acknowledge the strength and resoluteness of Trump and rein in their mercantilist impulses.”
Similarly, they argue that the country can “use its status as the world’s largest economy, the world’s largest consumer, and the world’s largest importer” to pressure the World Trade Organization on changes in tax treatment that they say disadvantage the U.S.
Trump, they say, will also somehow successfully renegotiate “bad trade deals” through sheer fortitude. When it comes to the trade deal struck with South Korea in 2012, for example, they write that with a President Trump “South Korea will have no grounds to complain when Trump calls for a renegotiation” and that the two countries “will simply seek a far more equitable deal.”
They also claim both that the United States is already in a trade war, and that Trump will avoid creating a deeper one in which countries levy escalating tariffs on American products to retaliate for tariffs we’ve levied on theirs. “Those who suggest that Trump trade policies will ignite a trade war ignore the fact that we are already engaged in a trade war,” they write. “[A]s Trump pursues a policy of more balanced trade, our major trading partners are far more likely to cooperate with an America resolute about balancing its trade than they are likely to provoke a trade war.”
But economists have predicted that overly aggressive trade policies, such as slapping entire countries with tariffs and ripping up existing trade agreements, would indeed spark retaliation. If Trump’s isn’t able to avoid an escalating trade war, it would have the opposite outcome than what he’s looking for. According to a recent analysis from the Peterson Institute, an organization that supports free trade, if Trump’s policies started a trade war it would send the economy into a recession and cost more than 4 million jobs. Another analysis from Moody’s found that if Mexico and China retaliated against tariffs on their imports, it would cost the country 7 million jobs."
100101,1010,Hillary Clinton and the soft bigotry of high debate expectations,https://thinkprogress.org/hillary-clinton-presidential-debate-unfair-high-expectations-25631f63e847#.8l5xrq61o,4,"Monday morning, Politico published an “Insiders” presidential debate preview featuring interviews with a bipartisan group of political professionals from swing states. One notable tidbit is that Republicans and Democrats agree that Hillary Clinton is under more pressure tonight.

This makes sense to a certain extent. Clinton’s once-significant lead over Donald Trump has diminished in recent weeks to the point where the race appears to be a dead heat heading into tonight’s debate. She needs a good performance to stem Trump’s momentum and reestablish herself as the frontrunner.
But there’s an unfair dynamic at work here too_—_one that’s captured nicely by a quote from an unnamed Ohio Democrat in the Politico piece.
“Hillary Clinton has spent a public lifetime of being held to a strikingly different standard, and this debate will be no exception,” the Ohio Democrat said. “She will have to answer every single question flawlessly, exude gravitas, look presidential, channel Bill’s and Barack’s oratorical mastery, not raise her voice, not cough, wear an acceptable pantsuit, smile enough, be likable, not laugh and have a good hair day. Donald Trump will just have to show up.”
The notion that Hillary is held to a higher standard was reinforced by a graphic MSNBC used during its debate coverage Monday morning.

In MSNBC’s estimation, Clinton has to explain her entire vision for the country to viewers. Trump, by contrast, just has to get through 90 minutes without lying.
There are plenty of other examples of pundits setting the bar low for Trump. A Washington Post piece headlined “Trump wins the debate expectations game” features this quote from Politico’s Jake Sherman: “I think that Trump is buoyed by the very low expectations. This is a guy who’s never debated one-on-one… So if he does passably, we’ll all say he won.” In the same vein, the New York Times’ Yamiche Alcindor is quoted as saying, “A lot of people are going to look at Donald Trump and think, ‘Hey, if he can even get out a good sentence and show off his experience, then he’s doing well,’” as is CNN’s Dana Bash, who said, “Maybe it’s not fair, but it’s the way it is_—_the onus is on her.”

Trump officials appeared on every Sunday show but were only asked about it on one network

More egregious examples of the same dynamic are featured in a Media Matters post. For instance, NBC’s Andrea Mitchell said last week that Trump “could go 90 minutes, misstating facts let’s say, but looking smooth, being the performer” and have a successful night. Fox News contributor Charles Krauthammer went even further, saying on September 9 that the Clinton campaign has “set the bar so low for Trump that if he just shows up not foaming at the mouth, if he looks normal, relaxed, and sort of reasonable, he wins automatically.” Krauthammer’s comment was echoed roughly a week later by Fox News’ Melissa Francis, who said, “The Clintons have set the bar so low for Donald Trump that if he doesn’t walk in sort of frothing at the mouth and, you know wearing a swastika, then I don’t think, you know, that it’s going to look like a victory.”
Whether NBC’s Lester Holt will even hold Trump to the low standard of calling him out on lying remains an open question. Earlier this month, NBC broadcast a Matt Lauer-hosted presidential forum where Trump lied with impunity. And yesterday, Commission on Presidential Debates head Janet Brown said she doesn’t think moderators should serve as fact-checkers.
Hillary Is The First Female Presidential Nominee And The Most Qualified Ever. It’s Not A Coincidence.

Research shows that women have to be more qualified than men to be given the same consideration…
thinkprogress.org 
“I don’t think it’s a good idea to get the moderator into essentially serving as the Encyclopedia Britannica,” Brown said on CNN.
The Trump campaign, meanwhile, is preemptively portraying major print media outlets as the “propaganda arm” of Clinton’s campaign for doing their own fact-checks of tonight’s debate. While Holt reportedly plans to take a more active role policing the proceedings than Lauer did, it’s clear that Clinton goes into tonight’s debate needing to clear a higher bar than Trump. For her, merely being present and not lying won’t be enough for pundits to deem her performance a success."
100102,1001,Clinton's most remarkable debate moment got lost in Trump'ssuckage—but it shouldn't,http://www.dailykos.com/stories/2016/9/27/1575018/-Clinton-s-most-remarkable-debate-moment-got-lost-in-Trump-s-suck-but-it-shouldn-t,5,"Let’s not let this moment get lost:

She brought up his abuse of one of his beauty-pageant contestants — noting, as an aside, his fondness for hanging around them — and that he called one contestant “Miss Piggy” and, because she is Latina, “Miss Housekeeper.” When Trump fell for the trap by demanding her name, Clinton supplied it: Alicia Machado, driving home the justifiable impression that Clinton sees her as a human being, unlike her opponent, who sees her as a piece of meat. 
As the Clinton campaign gamed out the debates, they clearly wanted a big send-off, something with real impact that would close the debate and hopefully dominate much of the post-debate narrative. They had to assume that either Donald Trump would debate her to a draw, simply by meeting his low-low pre-debate expectations, or that he might’ve even scored some points. So this was all pre-programmed, a set-piece, to try and own the night. 

The setup was great, “Miss Piggy”? Brutal. That sly side mention about how Trump loved to hang around beauty contestants? Awesome. He is creepy. Sleazy. Old guy hanging around beauty queens? Ew. And he had to buy his way into that. 

And Trump, Instead of keeping his mouth shut, did take the bait, demanding to know who Clinton was talking about. That alone was stupid: has he insulted so many women that he can’t keep them straight anymore? (Of course he has …) And at that moment, boom, Clinton humanizes this person. Gives her a name, a face. She’s Latina? Even better, because “Miss Housekeeper” is now further evidence of his racism. So he’s sexist, racist, and creepy. That’s not a winning combination. 

That’s some powerful stuff, even if it ended up overshadowed by the rest of Trump’s brutally bad evening. But again, it showed the difference between someone who has had to work twice as hard as any man to get to where she is today, and the guy who has never helped anyone, sacrificed anything, or had to really work for anything his entire life. 

Tuesday, Sep 27, 2016 · 7:29:24 PM · kos
As people are pointing out in comments, this moment isn’t really lost anymore thanks to Trump’s inability to let anything go. Doubling down on his attacks on Machado has given the story big legs. So yeah, it was overshadowed last night, not so much anymore thanks to Trump being an f’n moron. Good"
100103,1001,Trump defends stiffing thousands of people who built his 'unbelievable company',http://www.dailykos.com/stories/2016/9/27/1574954/-Trump-defends-stiffing-thousands-of-people-who-built-his-unbelievable-company,5,"Right after Donald Trump refused to deny that he doesn’t pay any federal income taxes, Hillary Clinton turned to his business record, saying that “if your main claim to be president of the United States is your business, then I think we should talk about that.”

… I have met a lot of the people who were stiffed by you and your businesses, Donald. I've met dishwashers, painters, architects, glass installers, marble installers, drapery installers, like my dad was, who you refused to pay when they finished the work that you asked them to do.

We have an architect in the audience who designed one of your clubhouses at one of your golf courses. It's a beautiful facility. It immediately was put to use. And you wouldn't pay what the man needed to be paid, what he was charging you to do…
Here, Trump fell back on his usual excuse: “Maybe he didn't do a good job and I was unsatisfied with his work.” Except, Donald, that somehow this has happened thousands of times. Either you’re falsely claiming you’re not happy with people’s work in order to justify refusing to pay them what you owe, what you promised … or you are the world’s worst manager to keep hiring such unsatisfactory people. Clinton continued:

CLINTON: Do the thousands of people that you have stiffed over the course of your business not deserve some kind of apology from someone who has taken their labor, taken the goods that they produced, and then refused to pay them?
But of course Trump is never going to apologize. He thinks it’s plain, simple, good business sense to cheat people if you can put money in your own pocket that way. “I take advantage of the laws of the nation because I'm running a company,” he answered. In the same way, he thinks it’s good business sense to spend his answer bragging not just about his “unbelievable company” with “some of the greatest assets anywhere in the world,” but specifically advertising his new hotel in Washington, D.C. Grifters gonna grift, and this is one unapologetic grifter."
100104,1001,Trump's debate performance was so bad it was ... really bad,http://www.dailykos.com/stories/2016/9/26/1574763/-Trump-s-debate-performance-was-so-bad-it-was-really-bad#read-more,5,"The 3AM call came at 9PM. That’s when the largest audience ever to watch a presidential debate tuned in to see two candidates tested to determine which of them was best suited to hold high office. As it turned out, only one candidate was ready to accept that call.

Before the debate there was a great deal of discussion about “which Donald Trump would show up.”  Would it be the blustering braggart who reassured the nation about the size of his … hands. Or would it be TelePrompTer Trump, delivering an equally viscious but more measured message featuring words of more than one syllable.

It turned out to be neither. Instead it was a Trump who was simply … awful. Awful by every measure.

From the very first question, the way the evening was going to unfold was clear. Hillary Clinton was prepared, relaxed, ready both for the questions and for her opponent. And Donald Trump simply thought he could wing it. It was Kellyanne Conway who called Trump 'the Babe Ruth of debating,’ but it was Donald Trump who clearly made the mistake of believing his own press. 

He was Trump, by gum. The guy with the best brain. The best words. He crushed low energy Jeb! He murdered Little Marco. He sent Lyin’ Ted running. Trump was too fast, too good to fail. But he did.

Hillary Clinton responded to the first economic question with an an opening into her plans for energy, education, the minimum wage, child care … it was a smooth summary of her position delivered to fit the two-minute window without sounding wonky or confusing. When the ball was handed to Trump, he immediately lurched into a half-speed version of his usual nationalist rant, blaming Mexico, blaming China, but offering up nothing that looked like policy. Instead of filling his time with two minutes of information, Trump replayed the same few phrases over and over—which would happen on almost every exchange.

In fact, this slow-boil replay of Trump's rally speech would turn out to be his high point. On the very next question, Hillary Clinton mentioned the loan Trump received from his father. Donald Trump physically cringed. In his response he tried to pass over the charge quickly, saying he got a “small loan,” but his temperature was on the rise.

Hillary had him hooked at that point. For the rest of the night, no matter what bait Clinton tried, she never failed to get a bite from Trump. 

But it was the tax return question when Hillary broke him. Broke him. Speculating about the reason Trump wouldn't release his taxes, Clinton rattled off every single sore spot on Trump's tender skin. Maybe he wasn't so rich. Maybe he wasn't so generous. Maybe he paid no taxes. In response, Trump openly bragged about paying no taxes. It was a response Clinton would use to bludgeon Trump again as someone who didn't contribute his fair share, and from that point on Trump became less self-possessed, less coherent, less able to restrain himself.

From there on, Trump could rarely string together something that came within a mile of a sentence. Even for those who had tried to decipher Trump's rally rhetoric or his answers at the CIC forum could only listen slack-jawed to the unrelated sets of words produced—at length—while both Hillary and moderator Lester Holt set back to allow Trump to … ramble is too kind.

In the middle of the debate, the answers around a series of race-related issues stood out not just for the groans and interruptions coming from Trump's side, but for Trump jumping on Holt to say that stop and frisk was not found unconstitutional — a moment where Trump came just short of recreating his “Mexican judge” attack. And Trump fell into not one, but two long defenses of his birtherism, including the statement that he had done the president a favor by “forcing” him to release his birth certificate. Then Trump repeatedly refused to apologize for any aspect of the fight even when reminded that the topic was healing wounds between the races.

Ironically, even as Trump was charging that Clinton lacked the stamina for the job, it was clear that his own knees were getting rubbery. He was increasingly unable to focus, or to respond with an answer that matched the question. Increasingly prone to wandering from every topic. His answers included the imaginary 400 lb hacker and the even more imaginary conversations with Sean Hannity that would prove Trump's opposition to the Iraq War.

By the end of the evening, Trump skated from “Rosie O’Donnell deserved it” to an answer on nuclear weapons that was denser than spent uranium—a response in which it was completely unclear if Donald Trump even knew what “first strike” actually meant.

Trump actually finished up with a statement that 1,800 immigrants who were slated to be deported were instead welcomed at citizens because someone “pressed the wrong button,” a story so bizarre that it almost certainly originated on his campaign CEO’s web site.

The level of performance from Trump should be disqualifying. Was disqualifying. 

Even people who really would stand for Trump shooting someone in the street are going to have a hard time with this debate."
100105,1002,No Post-Debate Letdown for Trump — Draws Enormous Crowd in Central Florida,http://www.breitbart.com/big-government/2016/09/27/no-post-debate-letdown-trump-draws-enormous-crowd-central-florida/,5,"MELBOURNE, FL – If Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump’s debate performance on Monday left much to be desired, it didn’t show at a rally on central Florida’s east coast a night later.
Trump drew perhaps his biggest crowd in Florida’s I-4 corridor at the Melbourne International Airport before a crowd of thousands under a backdrop of threatening weather. After giving remarks in remembrance of Miami Marlins pitcher Jose Fernandez and legendary professional golfer Arnold Palmer, Trump hit his usual chords on the economy, keying in on trade in particular.

Part of that included hitting his opponent Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton on the proposed Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPP) trade agreement.

“You can’t allow TPP to happen,” Trump declared. “It will be a catastrophe. Nothing will be as bad as NAFTA, but this one will be close. A vote for Hillary Clinton is a vote for TPP and the destruction and continued destruction of American jobs. America’s jobs are in deep trouble.”

In addition to trade, Trump hit Clinton on being the candidate of yesterday.

“It’s been 30 years of disappointment on foreign policy, on domestic policy, on helping women, on helping children. She’s done nothing. She had in the Senate — she had a couple of named bills and she named a post office, and I think that she named a road. she named something. She did nothing and she was terrible. The only thing that she succeeded at is helping her donors and covering up her crimes. That’s what she’s succeeded at,” he said as the crowd broke into chants of “lock her up.”

“Her single greatest achievement in my opinion will go down as getting away with the horrible crime that she committed with her classified information and her phony email and her illegal servers, and getting away with that when nobody else has and lives have been destroyed,” he added. “Let’s see what happens.” Spectators Look on as Trump Addresses Rally

The GOP nominee reflected on his visit to the Little Havana community in Miami earlier and vowed to push for reforms in communist Cuba.

“I will be a voice of freedom that includes freedom for people in Cuba,” he said. “Cuba is not — it’s not right what’s going. It’s not right.”

“This afternoon I spent a lot of time in Little Havana — an amazing place. President Obama had a one-sided deal for the Castros for nothing in return,” he continued. “Did you ever see this guy make a decent deal for this country? And you know what? ‘Crooked Hillary’ will be worse. She’s going to be worse than Obama, mark my words. She’s going to be worse than Obama and that’s why on November 8, you can’t let it happen.”

Trump went on to use the circumstances in Cuba as a segue to attack what he deemed to be the corruption of Hillary Clinton and her husband former President Bill Clinton.

My administration will be a voice against oppression in this hemisphere. Those who lived in these countries also understand the dangers of corrupt politicians like Hillary Clinton, who used government power for personal profit. Bill and Hillary Clinton were paid $150 million for speeches to special interests since Bill left office.

Bill Clinton was being paid to give speeches by many of the same people who had matters before the State Department while Hillary was secretary of state. Clinton donors got favorable treatment and access to the State Department. It’s called pay for play.

Our secretary of state can be bought or bribed or whatever you want to call it or sell trades to the government or favors or access. And I’ll tell you, when that happens our whole system is threatened and we have to stop it on November 8.

Remember when you go to vote, don’t vote for “Crooked” Hillary, just put it in your head, “Crooked” Hillary. She is a crooked one. America can never elect a candidate like Clinton who put her public office up for sale. Hillary Clinton tried to cover up her crimes by deleting 33,000 emails after a congressional subpoena and destroy her phones, some of them with a hammer. Trump took aim at the so-called establishment by pointing to Election Day and promising a winning outcome.

“The arrogance of Washington, DC will soon come face-to-face with the righteous verdict of the American voter,” Trump said. “We’re going to do it. We’re going to do it. This November we’re going to show the whole world that America is back, bigger and better and stronger than ever before.”

This is Trump’s sixth appearance in the Sunshine State since the Republican National Convention, suggesting the campaign sees the state’s 29 electoral votes as essential in securing the presidency. In addition to the Melbourne rally, Trump has appeared in Pensacola, Ft. Myers, Tampa, Kissimmee, and Ft. Lauderdale.

Trump lobbied attendees to get out and vote and he is going to need every vote he can get. He is currently locked in a dead heat with Clinton in the state of Florida. According to the Real Clear Politics average of Florida polls, Clinton leads by just six-tenths of a point in the closing week of September."
100106,1002,"TV Clip Shows Donald Trump Did Not Support Iraq War, Despite Lester Holt, ‘Fact Check’ Claims",http://www.breitbart.com/big-government/2016/09/27/trump-iraq-war-support-weak-lester-holt/,5,"A rediscovered 2003 interview of Donald Trump has knocked sideways the Democrats’ media-magnified strategy to hide Hillary Clinton’s support for the 2003 Iraq campaign.
The Democrats’ strategy is to divert attention from Clinton’s support for the war by arguing that Trump backed the Iraq campaign in 2003. They base that claim on a tepid 2002 endorsement by Trump when he was being interviewed on Howard Stern’s radio show. “Yeah, I guess so,” Trump said when asked if he supported the pending campaign.

In sharp contrast to Trump’s comments as a New York real-estate developer, then-New York Sen. Hillary Clinton repeatedly spoke in favor of the campaign, and she cast her vote to authorize and fund the war.

The new tape of Trump’s opposition comes from January 2003, before the operation was launched.

“Well, I’m starting to think that people are much more focused now on the economy,” Trump told Fox News’ Neil Cavuto. “They’re getting a little bit tired of hearing ‘We’re going in, we’re not going in.’ Whatever happened to the days of [Gen.] Douglas MacArthur? Either do it or don’t do it.”

“Perhaps he shouldn’t be doing it yet. And perhaps we should be waiting for the United Nations,” Trump said.

“The Iraqi situation is a problem, and I think the economy is a much bigger problem,” he added.

During the September 26 presidential debate, moderator Lester Holt insisted that it was a proven fact that Donald Trump supported George W. Bush’s war in Iraq before Trump was against it.

Holt insisted that GOP nominee Donald Trump “had supported the war in Iraq before the invasion.”

The real estate mogul adamantly rejected the assertion and re-iterated that he was always against the war. “The record shows that I’m right,” Trump said to Holt. “When I did an interview with Howard Stern, very lightly, first time anyone’s asked me that, I said, very lightly, ‘I don’t know, maybe, who knows?’ Essentially. I then did an interview with Neil Cavuto. We talked about the economy is more important [than going to war].”

Holt, accused of acting as a third debater that night, cut Trump off saying, “The record does not show that.”

Like many on the left goaded by the Clinton campaign’s media shop, Holt was referring to Donald Trump’s interview with radio’s Howard Stern in 2002. When asked during the Stern interview if the U.S. should invade Iraq, Trump replied with a very weak affirmation, “Yeah, I guess so.” This January focus on the economy is a far more negative characterization of the impending war than his earlier, more noncommittal “yeah, I guess so.”

Despite this record, several so-called fact checkers and other media outlets have continued to claim Trump fully supported the war before he turned against it."
100107,1002,The Nuclear Option: Trump Was Very Good — And Will Be Even Better,http://www.breitbart.com/2016-presidential-race/2016/09/27/nuclear-option-trump-good-will-even-better/,5,"HEMPSTEAD, N.Y. — Monday night’s debate here was a tremendous victory for Donald Trump, but his performance left plenty of room for improvement.
Big picture: Polls show support for Hillary Clinton is collapsing, and she desperately needed to stanch the bleeding. She did nothing during the debate to change the trajectory of those increasingly bleak polls.

With states like Pennsylvania and Colorado in play this week, we could be talking about states like Michigan and Wisconsin in play next week. That would put the race away early for Mr. Trump.
Mrs. Clinton’s primary charge against Mr. Trump is that he lacks the “temperament” to be president. In an easy glide Monday night, Mr. Trump demonstrated otherwise.

He was perfectly presidential, even if a bit unpolished at times — just the way so many of his supporters love him. He was poised and even a bit mannerly at times.

Perhaps a bit too mannerly. But we’ll get to that.

Mrs. Clinton failed to do anything that will change the overwhelming view of her that she is slick, calculating and out of touch. And her plastic smile and that practiced, canned laugh — including a truly bizarre shoulder jiggle at one point — will only feed the notion that she is not really all there.

In addition, Mrs. Clinton failed to land any devastating punches on Mr. Trump. She landed a few potent shots about his tax proposals and his tax returns, but nothing extraordinary. And nothing anywhere near as withering as everything everybody in both parties and the media have already hurled at the guy.

 

From the start, the debate was lively and fiery. That was not because of the moderator, and it certainly was not because Hillary Clinton was on stage. It was entirely owing to Mr. Trump’s presence.

Something about his swashbuckling manner always puts people off kilter a little, and the result always seems to be a debate that is more robust and honest — if sometimes a bit imprecise.

As for moderator Lester Holt, he will be excoriated in coming days for his multiple follow-up questions of Mr. Trump and his failure to ask even the most basic questions of Mrs. Clinton.

She also used up a number of lines that she had obviously practice extensively — to little effect.

“I know you live in your own reality,” she said at one point, but it was entirely lost in muddle.

But here is where Mr. Trump has a lot of room to improve.

Instead of simply prosecuting the case against Mrs. Clinton, he dutifully answered all of Mr. Holt’s questions and responded to all of Mrs. Clinton’s jabs — no matter how silly.

After successfully turning questions about his unreleased tax returns into questions about Hillary Clinton’s 33,000 destroyed emails, Mr. Trump dutifully changed the subject back to his tax returns and spent far more time explaining that. Forget the tax returns and hammer away at the emails.

One of his sharpest moments came when he repeatedly hammered her for an answer on whether the economy and bad trade deals was the fault of President Obama or former President Bill Clinton.

In truth, that is the entire crux of his campaign and if he sticks with it, he will win.

He is most effective when he is reminding people that Hillary Clinton has been around on the national political stage for the better part of three decades and only now offering to fix things.

“Why are you just thinking of these solutions now?” he asked in possibly his best line.

A good runner-up was when he acknowledged that Mrs. Clinton has plenty of experience, “but it’s bad, bad experience.”

The really good news for Donald Trump supporters is that if we have learned nothing else from this election, it is that Mr. Trump is a fast learner. He was very good in this debate. He will be even better in the next."
100108,1003,Is The Clinton Foundation A Front?,http://www.huffingtonpost.com/andy-schupak/is-the-clinton-foundation_b_12164124.html?utm_hp_ref=politics,5,"Because Donald Trump has continually accused the Clintons of turning the Clinton Foundation into a crime organization, I decided to investigate his charge. What I discovered was that Bill Clinton has built one of the most extraordinary non-governmental organizations in the world. In fact, the Clinton Foundation may be doing more to improve the lives of the poor and needy than most governments. I also found that the foundation saves American taxpayers money by serving as a quasi-American foreign and domestic services organization. Now, instead of fighting Congress for taxpayer money to fund his programs, President Clinton lobbies the world’s rich and powerful for the money he needs to support his programs. And he’s found 200,000 contributors.

If you think that number is impressive, you’ll be even more impressed by the number of people who have benefitted from the money Clinton’s raised: 450 million!!!! The American Institute of Philanthropy is also impressed. That’s why they have given the Clinton Foundation an A rating and named them one of the top philanthropic organizations in the world. And the American Institute of Philanthropy is not the only monitoring organization that has given the foundation an A rating. So has Charity Navigator.

So what exactly has the Clinton Foundation accomplished? Watch these videos to see for yourself.

100109,1003,Are Men Like Trump Afraid of Vaginas?,http://www.huffingtonpost.com/julie-zack-yaste/are-men-like-trump-afraid_b_12188072.html?utm_hp_ref=politics,5,"For a while now, I’ve been a casual feminist. I’ve got Roxanne Gay’s Bad Feminist on my nightstand. I follow Gloria Steinem on Twitter. I rant about Donald Trump being a misogynist on Facebook to my 653 closest friends. But in all honesty, until recently, I looked at feminism as an intellectual exercise. It’s great to have a movement to get equal lady rights, but the contingency of men out there who really don’t think much of women can’t be that big, right?

It is. When nearly half the country is ready to support Donald Trump over Hillary Clinton as our nation’s leader, a megalomaniac who has a long history of saying really shitty things about women, there is clearly still a problem with sexism in America. He’s proud of his strong daughter, but has also said he’d probably date her if he wasn’t his daughter, clearly highlighting that he values women as sex objects that are designed to bring satisfaction to men, instead of, you know, being people. (Note: saying that you’re proud of a strong female daughter as a man is totally ok; saying you’d bang her under different circumstances is creepy.)

Why is anyone listening to him? It blows my mind on a daily basis that anyone who is a sane adult would support a man who has vocally supported banning Muslims in a country founded on religious freedom, building a wall to keep immigrants out in a land where almost none of the population’s families have been here more than a couple hundred years, and suggested that a foreign government hack into the email of his opponent which is totally illegal and possibly treason. His entire platform is not to make America great again, but to make it wholly un-American.

Why are people supporting him? The only thing that I can rationally point to is that a woman president is too scary for many men in this country.

Are guys really so afraid of people with vaginas that they’d rather elect Donald Trump than an intelligent woman? I know it comes down to more than that. There’s policy (which has largely been unreported this election cycle), but in the same way that race was so not the issue in 2008 for conservatives, I’m sure gender has no sway in this race. (If my dripping sarcasm wasn’t clear, I’ll be explicit: gender and race played heavily in 2008 and now in 2016, and that is wrong.)

I won’t claim that Hillary Clinton is without fault. She’s a person. We’re all flawed. What I am saying is that I’m not overly bothered by her flaws. She’s smart and has spent years in public service. I’d like to see her win.

I listen to a lot of radio shows, and had the chance to hear Blackish creator Kenya Barris on Fresh Air with Terry Gross. He talks about his son not knowing that Barack Obama was the first black president. His son is young enough that Obama is the only president he’s known, and Obama is black. It’s kind of beautiful in his view, but also scary because he wants his son to know how important it was for a black man to become president.

When my husband returns from deployment with the Navy, we want to have a baby. No matter the gender of our possible offspring, I want the kid to know a world with a woman president, and not see that as strange or groundbreaking. I want it to be normal. I’m tired of almost exclusively white men running the country. I’m ready to be a fully-fledged feminist, because clearly the country needs more people standing up for women’s equality.

We have a chance this election to do something monumental. Let’s do that. Let’s not elect a man, who in my opinion is a misogynist, xenophobic, racist liar who can do no good for this country."
100110,1003,Hillary’s Biggest Challenge: Bringing Back Decent Jobs,http://www.huffingtonpost.com/jane-white/hillarys-biggest-challeng_1_b_12193590.html?utm_hp_ref=politics,5,"One of the biggest ironies about Donald Trump’s Presidential campaign is his pledge to bring back jobs that have been outsourced to other countries—the major driver behind his support from blue-collar workers. On the campaign trail, Trump has blasted Ford Motor Co. for opening factories in Mexico, criticized a U.S. drug company that moved its headquarters offshore and said he will eat no more Oreo cookies because its maker, Nabisco, moved part of its production to Mexico.

Why hasn’t the media confronted Trump about the fact that Donald J. Trump Collection shirts - as well as eyeglasses, perfume, cuff links and suits - are made in Bangladesh, China, Honduras and other low-wage countries?

The 21st century has ushered in a massive globalization shift when it comes to jobs—and while conservative economists like to compare economics to a rising tide that lifts all boats it’s more like an Olympics featuring an exponential increase in contestants competing for a limited number of prizes.

What does a U.S. university professor and a UK laborer have in common? Puny wages and/or benefits.

Anne McLeer’s experience as an adjunct professor at George Washington University inspired her to not only start a union but help lead one: SEIU’s Local 500’s higher education work, which now represents GWU’s part-time faculty.

“Before I started teaching I was a grad student with a 20-hour a week job as an administrative assistant to one of my dissertation advisers,” McLeer recalls. “I was considered “permanent part-time staff” and had access to a retirement plan...and health plan. The day I gave up that job and I started teaching, which you would think is closer to the mission of the university, I became a `temporary part-time person’ with absolutely nothing.

Incredibly, the majority of professors in the U.S. are benefit-deprived. According to the American Association of University Professors, 70 percent of college faculty work outside the tenure track. So they likely wind up working at multiple employers but still get no benefits.

Across the “pond”, a survey of social attitudes found that while only 25 percent of Britons have jobs that involved routine or manual labor, 60 percent of them view themselves as working class, the major driver behind their votes for Brexit.

Like Anne McLeer, Colin Hewlett of the U.K. has seen his standard of living collapse. Hewlett, who has worked as a garbage man, bakery worker and now a packer at a canned food factory, has seen his pay crash from more than $665 a week to just $318 in three years. Worse, he added, is that his previously secure full-time employment contract has morphed into a “zero hours contract,” under which his employer decides how much he works and how much it pays him depending on what it needs. “It is basically slave labor,” Hewlett said.

McLeer and Hewlett’s jobs may not have been outsourced but like millions of others they are working for companies who can’t be bothered to pay them what they’re worth.

The former president of the SEIU, Andy Stern, has authored a must-read book, “Raising the Floor,” that tackles the threat to American jobs, from slave-labor wages to automation.

Stern points out that the investment in self-driving cars will inevitably morph into the development of self-driving trucks, a move that will not only put millions of workers out of work—driving trucks is the most common job in 29 states— but its ripple effect will destroy millions of other jobs.

As Stern puts it, “I’m thinking about all those truck drivers. And the cooks and waitresses who work at highway diners and truck stops. And the men and women who license trucks and drivers at the DMV. “

Despite the Census Bureau’s recent rosy jobs report, the first decade of the 21st century has been a “lost decade” of wage and income growth for most American families., according to the Economic Policy Institute’s 2012 report, “The State of Working America.”

Wages for the top 1 percent grew about 156 percent between 1979 and 2007, whereas wages for the bottom 90 percent rose by less than 17 percent.

One of the major drivers to our economic stress is outsourcing of jobs requiring a college degree. In the early 2000s globalization affected the jobs of computer programmers, scientists, and doctors. A recent survey by the Center for College Affordability and Productivity found that 48 % of employed college graduates work in jobs that the Bureau of Labor Statistics says require less then a 4 year college degree. Of those that found work, 16.5% are bartenders, 14% are waiters or waitresses, 18% are telemarketers and 24.6% are in retail—an industry that will shrink even more due to the explosive growth of online purchases.

Then we’ve got the freelancers, part-timers, contingent and 1099 workers who share Ann McLeer’s dilemma. As observed in the book Raw Deal, a 2015 survey commissioned by the Freelancers Union and Elance (a web-based platform for online, contingent work) found that 53 million workers had engaged in supplemental, temporary, or project- or contract-based work in the past 12 months. In other words, 34 percent of the total US workforce is freelance.

To make matters worse, no matter how highly rated a freelancer might be, she or he can always be outbid by another worker willing to work for less money in the Philippines, India, Bangladesh, or other locations.

Stern says if we can’t bring back high-paying jobs we should at least institute a Universal Basic Income of $1,000 a month for those between the ages of 18 and 64 who are struggling to make ends meet. The program would be paid for by eliminating some welfare programs or some tax deductions or instituting a value-added tax (VAT) which currently 160 countries use to generate revenue, among various other approaches.

Universal basic income is a concept that’s been supported by many economic thinkers, from Thomas Paine to conservative economist Milton Friedman. Andy Stern is probably right that ultimately machines or workers in other countries may take American jobs, but in the meantime can’t we treat our workers better?

As Pulitzer Prize winning author Hedrick Smith observed in his book Who Stole the American Dream, so disproportionate has America’s ratio of incomes become when you’re comparing the wagers of 1 percenters to the other 99% that in 2011 the OECD ranks the U.S. 31st—fourth from the bottom—among its 34 member countries. Only Mexico, Chile, and Turkey did worse.

Compare the U.S. with Germany, an economic powerhouse that treats its workers like assets, not liabilities. Since 1985, Germany’s average wage has gone up nearly 30 percent versus only 6 percent here. In foreign trade, Germany generated $2 trillion in trade surpluses from 2000 to 2010, while we racked up $6 trillion in trade deficits. So today, Germany still has more than twice as many people working in manufacturing as the U.S.—21% of its workforce compared to 9% of ours.

In fact, during the 2008 economic collapse, big German companies shortened everyone’s workweek instead of laying off masses of workers, saving 400,000 jobs. As a result, Germany’s unemployment rate went down during the recession while America’s rose sharply and stayed high. (Speaking of Germany, Trump’s German relatives are utterly embarrassed by him and a study by Pew Research Center found that only 6% of its citizens considers him trustworthy.)

First off, why can’t we boost in government spending on research and development?. As the authors of Second Machine Age point out, GPS systems, touchscreen displays, voice recognition software like Apple’s Siri, and many other innovations arose from government-sponsored research. Google’s driverless car was a direct outgrowth of a Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA) challenge that offered a one-million-dollar prize for a car that could navigate a specific course without a human driver.

And maybe robots will ultimately replace construction workers but in the meantime we need to hire them to replace our crumbling roads, bridges and rails. The U.S. Chamber of Commerce estimates that America’s faltering infrastructure costs the United States $1 trillion in economic growth and hampers U.S. exports. In world rankings of infrastructure, the United States has fallen from No. 1 to No. 15. In high-speed rail development, China is outspending the United States $300 billion to $10 billion

Clinton is facing the biggest economic challenges since FDR ran the White House. Let’s hope she takes the right steps."
100111,1004,Clinton Knocks Trump For Bragging About Not Paying Taxes During Debate,http://talkingpointsmemo.com/livewire/hillary-clinton-knocks-trump-debate-comments-taxes-housing-crisis,5,"Fresh off a strong performance in the first presidential debate, Hillary Clinton on Tuesday knocked Donald Trump for bragging about not paying taxes and financially benefiting from the housing crisis.

Speaking to an audience at Wake Technical Community College in Raleigh, North Carolina, the former secretary of state repeated her debate-night claim that Trump’s refusal to release his tax returns may be because he had “paid nothing in federal taxes,” as was true on the few years of his returns that he made public. Trump replied on stage, ""That makes me smart."" “Now, if not paying taxes makes him smart, what does that make all the rest of us?” Clinton asked the crowd.

Clinton said that she and her husband Bill “didn’t come from billionaire families” but have been financially successful in their public lives.

“We believe with the blessings we’ve been giving, we should do our part,” she said to cheers from the audience.

Clinton then went after Trump for boasting to the debate audience at Hofstra University about his past comments calling the housing market bubble a “great opportunity” for his real estate empire. Trump said of those remarks, “That’s called business.”

“What kind of person believes that?” Clinton asked. “What kind of person would want to root for 9 million families losing their homes? One who should never be president is the answer to that question.”"
100112,1004,Trump Says Former Miss Universe 'Gained A Massive Amount Of Weight',http://talkingpointsmemo.com/livewire/trump-miss-universe-gained-massive-amount-weight,5,"Donald Trump on Tuesday morning responded Hillary Clinton's comment during the debate that Trump once called a beauty contest contestant ""Miss Piggy,"" saying on ""Fox and Friends"" that the Miss Universe contestant had ""gained a massive amount of weight.""

Trump brought up Clinton's remarks about Alicia Machado, a former Miss Universe winner who Trump encouraged to lose weight after she won the crown in the 1990s, when he was asked if Clinton got under his skin. Trump said that Machado was the ""absolute worst.""

""She was the worst we ever had. The worst, the absolute worst. She was impossible, and she was a Miss Universe contestant and ultimately a winner who they had a tremendously difficult time with as Miss Universe,"" he said on ""Fox and Friends."" ""She was the winner, and, you know, she gained a massive amount of weight, and it was a real problem. We had a real problem. Not only that, her attitude, and we had a real problem with her,"" Trump continued. ""So Hillary went back into the years and she found this girl. This was many years ago, and found the girl and talked about her like she was Mother Teresa, and it wasn't quite that way, but that's okay. Hillary has to do what she has to do. I see what's happening in the polls.""

During the debate, Clinton used Trump's past comments about Machado to illustrate how he treats women.

""And one of the worst things he said was about a woman in a beauty contest -- he loves beauty contests, supporting them and hanging around them -- and he called this woman 'Miss Piggy,' then he called her 'Miss Housekeeping' because she was Latina,"" Clinton said during the debate."
100113,1004,Trump: I Don't Want To Push 'Conspiracy Theories' But My Mic Was Bad,http://talkingpointsmemo.com/livewire/trump-bad-microphone,5,"Donald Trump on Tuesday morning complained that during the Monday night debate, his microphone was malfunctioning and that the volume was lower than that of Hillary Clinton's microphone.

""I had a problem with a microphone that didn't work,"" he said on ""Fox and Friends."" ""My microphone was terrible. I wonder, was it set up that way on purpose? My microphone, in the room they couldn't hear me, you know, it was going on and off. Which isn't exactly great. I wonder if it was set up that way, but it was terrible.""

""It was on and off, and it was much lower than hers. I don't want to believe in conspiracy theories, of course, but it was much lower than hers and it was crackling, and she didn't have that problem,"" he added. ""That to me was a bad problem, you have a bum mic, it’s not exactly good.""

Trunmp also insisted that he does not have a cold or allergies when asked whether he was sniffling during the debate.

""No, no sniffles. No, You know, the mic was very bad, but maybe it was good enough to hear breathing, but there was no sniffles,"" he said on ""Fox and Friends."""

Near the end of the debate, Clinton blasted Trump for how he had treated Alicia Machado, who won the Miss Universe pageant in 1996, representing Venezuela. (Trump owned the Miss Universe pageant from 1996 until 2015.) ""One of the worst things he's said was about a woman in a beauty contest,"" Clinton said. ""He loves beauty contests, supporting them and hanging around them. And he called this woman 'Miss Piggy.' Then he called her 'Miss Housekeeping,' because she's Latina."" Trump criticized Machado for gaining weight and invited the media to watch her exercise.

In the video, Machado narrates in Spanish, filling in the details of her interactions with Trump. ""He was overwhelming,"" she says. ""I was very scared of him. He'd yell at me all the time."""
100115,1005,Trump's Huge Conflict of Interest With a Big Foreign Bank Keeps Getting Worse,http://www.motherjones.com/politics/2016/09/trumps-conflict-interest-big-overseas-bank-getting-worse-minute,5,"Deutsche Bank is in deep trouble. Its stock price has plummeted in recent days after the Justice Department demanded the gigantic German bank pay $14 billion to settle claims regarding its sale of bad mortgage-backed securities in the the run-up to the 2008 financial crisis. The bank's shares fell to a new low on Tuesday over reports it might be seeking a bailout from the German government—which Deutsche Bank has denied. The crisis has exposed the fragile state of one of the world's largest banks, but it also highlights a potential massive conflict of interest for Donald Trump.

In the past few years, Trump obtained $364 million in loans from Deutsche bank via four mortgages on three of his prized properties: Miami's Doral National golf course, Chicago's Trump International Hotel and Tower, and the newly opened Trump International Hotel in Washington, D.C., a few blocks from the White House. A foreign entity holding so much of Trump's debt—financial leverage that could affect the decision-making of a future commander in chief—has raised alarms among ethics watchdogs. But with Deutsche Bank floundering, the possible conflicts posed by Trump's loans are compounding.

The financial health of Deutsche Bank is important for Trump's corporate empire. Because of Trump's history of failed projects and repeated bankruptcies, many of the world's top banks have long stopped doing business with him. Deutsche Bank was one of the only major banks—perhaps the only—that would work with him, and their relationship has been rocky. Trump wore out his welcome with Deutsche Bank's corporate banking arm in 2008, when he attempted to get out of paying $40 million he personally owed the bank after his company failed to make a payment deadline on a larger $640 million loan for his Chicago project. But Trump has maintained his relationship with Deutsche's so-called ""private bank""—an arm of the bank that caters to wealthy people and has more flexibility in its lending standards than the corporate side. The four loans Trump currently has with Deutsche Bank are each from the private bank, a Deutsche Bank official told Mother Jones.

Deutsche Bank has vowed to fight the US government over the hefty fine it is threatening to impose. The bank has said that it is prepared to pay no more than $2 or $3 billion and noted in a statement last week that it has ""no intent to settle these potential civil claims anywhere near the number cited."" Settlement negotiations are expected to take months, raising the possibility that Trump might be in the White House when a final decision is made. In an unprecedented face-off between a foreign bank and an administration led by a man deeply in debt to that bank, how would Trump balance the public interest with his private interests? Could American taxpayers be assured that a Trump administration would aggressively seek the maximum penalty against a lender that played a role in tanking the economy in 2008? Or would Deutsche Bank receive special consideration or favorable terms because of its ties to—or leverage over—Trump?

The news media has paid attention to the the debt Trump, via partnerships, owes a Chinese bank. But Trump's relationship with Deutsche Bank has yet to receive much scrutiny. And if Deutsche Bank continues to falter, there is the possibility that it may need to sell off loans, perhaps including the Trump loans. It's hard to imagine a more staggering conflict of interest than a potential or sitting president's debts being placed on the global market. What individuals or financial institutions here or abroad might buy them?  Meanwhile, Trump has offered no firm explanation for how he would separate himself from his businesses—or his debts—if elected president."
100116,1006,Rush: Trump won last night by showing that he’s not of the system,http://hotair.com/archives/2016/09/27/rush-trump-won-last-night-showing-hes-not-system/,5,"Via the Daily Rushbo, this is a highly plausible argument but my reaction to it is complicated by the fact that I just don’t trust Rush anymore to level with his audience if he spies bad news somewhere for Trump. The guiding principle of his show over the past year has been “Don’t piss off the Trumpers.” There are too many of them among his audience to risk alienating. He can get away with criticizing Trump only if it’s done delicately and slathered with lots of praise and qualifiers. So for instance, during the primaries, Rush took care to say that Ted Cruz was the closest thing to Reagan since Reagan and was the obvious choice for president if you’re into conservatism. Implicit in that is the idea that if you’re a Trumper who’s not so much into conservatism anymore, then hey, that’s cool. Stick with your guy. Don’t piss off the Trumpers.

Realistically, then, Trump would have had to soil himself onstage for Rush to pronounce the debate a setback this morning. If Trump had nailed it, with cogent policy answers and crisp attacks on Hillary for the full 90 minutes, Rush would have declared that he had passed the “presidential test” and proclaimed the election over. (And he might have been right.) If Trump didn’t nail it, Rush was destined to fall back on the usual damage control that Trump is playing a game the political class simply doesn’t understand but The People do, and therefore anything that might seem like a setback isn’t necessarily a setback. The virtue of that logic from the standpoint of not pissing off the Trumpers is that it not only spares Trump from criticism — Rush briefly allows that he missed a few “hanging curveballs” — but it’s mostly unfalsifiable. Unless Trump’s polls completely tank next week, there’ll be no immediate proof that he did himself any damage in the last low-energy hour of the debate. “He’s not of the system” is a way to reassure Trump fans at moments when he seems to have screwed up that there’s simply no way to gauge whether he screwed up or not — even if they secretly think he has. (And some of them do think that.)

Just because Rush has his own reasons for treading lightly around criticism of Trump, though, doesn’t make him wrong. A lot of big media types are going to listen to the clip below, recall how many times they made the stinkface during one of Trump’s primary debates, and then muse that Trump never seemed to suffer in the polls despite showing himself to be the least informed candidate onstage. Anti-Trumpers left, right, and center are roundly spooked at this point that not being prepared on policy really doesn’t seem to matter to voters — or at least, not to Republican voters. Matthew Continetti made the same point Rush did in a debate recap at the Free Beacon last night:

The first minutes of the debate were subdued. But very quickly Donald Trump reverted to form. He interrupted. He heckled. He boasted, exaggerated, delivered his miasma of phrase and verbiage. Many of the things he said were untrue or, as Trump put it, “semi-exact.” But he also struck to the theme of his candidacy: the political system is broken, and only an outsider, proven in the business world, can fix it. Throughout the debate Trump referred to Clinton’s long history on the public stage. He needled her, mocked her, and in some cases—trade most significantly—passionately made the case against the bipartisan consensus that has ruled foreign policy since the end of the Cold War. Clinton displayed the qualities that have brought her to this point: detailed knowledge of policy, fluency in speech, polished delivery of canned attack lines (some more effective than others)…

But he has a strategy. He is the outsider against the establishment. It’s the same play he made in the GOP primary. Trump would be the first president not to have held public office or been a general. He turned that fact into an asset because the Republican electorate so detests the status quo…

One must say he has the perfect foil. Hillary Clinton delivered her well-rehearsed lines well. But it is true that she has been in the public eye forever, for longer than some voters have been alive. And that she represents the current power structure at a time—the end of a second presidential term—when the electorate has historically opted for change.
We’ve entered the “Trump zone,” says Continetti, a zone in which a guy whom the public itself views in poll after poll as unqualified for the job might nonetheless be chosen over a candidate who is seen as qualified because she embodies a political establishment they’ve come to despise. That’s not supposed to happen with an office that involves command of nuclear weapons, but here we are. “One thing came through crystal clear last night: Donald Trump showed everybody and reminded many that he is not of the system,” says Rush below, echoing the point. “He is not a Washington insider, and he is not responsible for any of the mess or messes that exist today. On the other hand, Hillary Clinton showed that that is exactly who she is.” That’s what you’d say if you wanted to reassure Trump fans that the last hour of the debate didn’t matter much. But that doesn’t mean it’s wrong.

If you’re a Democrat, the best you can do with all of that is to tell yourself that general-election swing voters are different from Republican primary voters, which is true but not so true as to prevent this race from being a dead heat with less than two months to go. Actually, the best Democrats can do to buoy morale is probably to remind themselves that this is now a “base election” and that Clinton will win if she can get more of her base to the polls than Trump can get of his. Dems seemed please with Hillary’s performance last night; if that helps them get their side ready to vote then it achieved something notwithstanding the unpredictable “Trump zone” effect. Here are two clips of Rush, one of him making the point about the system and then a much longer clip of his entire reaction to the debate. (It’ll be quicker to read the transcript.) In the course of today’s monologue, he also noted in passing that, er, lots of online polls showed Trump winning even though the scientific polls didn’t, which is a sad turn for a smart man who surely understands polling after 30 years of commenting on it. You know the motto, though: Don’t piss off the Trumpers."
100117,1006,Howard Dean doubles down: Maybe Trump has a coke habit,http://hotair.com/archives/2016/09/27/howard-dean-doubles-maybe-trump-coke-habit/,5,"That seems pretty out there for someone who is a medical doctor. But Dean refused to back down Tuesday, telling MSNBC that he wasn’t making a diagnosis via television and then going on to suggest Trump might have a cocaine habit.

“You can’t make a diagnosis over the television. I would never do that but he has some interesting…that is actually a signature of people who use cocaine,” Dean said. He continued, “I’m not suggesting that Trump does but…” At this point he was cut off by host Kate Snow who interjected, “Well, you are suggesting it actually in a tweet.” Dean replied, “No, I’m suggesting we think about it because here’s the interesting constellation.

“So, he sniffs during the presentation which is something that users do. He also has grandiosity which is something that accompanies that problem. He has delusions—I’m not talking about being crazy, but for example when he told everybody it was smart not to pay taxes and then denied he said it after he said it in front of 100 million people. It’s not that he’s delusiairy [A real word?] about it it’s that he thinks somehow that he won’t get caught. That is delusional. He has trouble with pressured speech. He interrupted, as you pointed out, Hillary Clinton 29 times. He couldn’t keep himself together. So, look, do I think at 70 years old he has a cocaine habit? Probably not. But (laughs) you know, it’s something I think it would be interesting to ask him and see if he ever had a problem with that.”

MSNBC host Kate Snow seemed pretty astounded by this. “So as a physician and as a medical person yourself, you’re suggesting that we ought to look at whether the Republican candidate for President has a cocaine habit,” she said. Dean then claimed once again he wasn’t making a diagnosis but then repeated that “these four symptoms” were “striking.”

When Snow compared what Dean was doing to comments Rudy Giuliani had made about Hillary Clinton’s health, Dean suggested Trump needed to release his medical records and tax returns.

A few points about all of this. First, Howard Dean endorsed Clinton and spoke at the Democratic convention this summer. He’s firmly on team Clinton. In fact, this is not even the first time he has used his medical opinion in this campaign. When Clinton collapsed earlier this month, Dean tweeted that it was not a big deal “from a medical point of view.” Second, Dean isn’t doing this off the cuff. He came with prepared talking points to suggest Trump might be a coke-head. Also the line about running a presidential campaign at 70 is one he repeats a couple of times almost verbatim. This attack was prepared in advance.

Third, even if you assume the Clinton camp was taken by surprise by Dean’s tweet last night, one call could have shut down this MSNBC interview before it happened. So it’s fair to assume that, at least tacitly, the campaign doesn’t have a problem with Dean doubling down on this.

Keep in mind, one of Hillary’s big moments in last night’s debate was hitting Trump over his birtherism attack on Obama while also maintaining she had nothing to do with it. And yet, only a few hours later one of her supporters is on television launching an incredibly sleazy attack on her opponent and she’s what…not aware of it this time either? Will anyone ask the campaign to denounce Dean for this?

The Clintons love to play the martyr in the media, but they fight as dirty as anyone in politics. When Trump goes low, Hillary goes lower. "
100118,1006,Hillary wins debate on topics America doesn’t care about,http://hotair.com/archives/2016/09/27/hillary-wins-debate-topics-america-doesnt-care/,5,"If a candidate wins a debate about topics nobody cares about, does it change a voter’s mind? I suppose we’ll find out in the next few days, but there’s no doubt the American people just watched a debate focused on topics that won’t make much of a difference in many of their lives.

According to a recent Pew Research poll, the three top issues for American voters are the economy, foreign policy and terrorism. And yet, Monday night’s debate centered a lion’s share of its time on race relations, stop and frisk policy, President Obama’s birth certificate and Donald Trump’s tax return. The first segment presented by moderator Lester Holt was titled “Achieving Prosperity” and was supposed to center on jobs. This, on the face of it, appeared to address the economy, the top issue in that Pew poll. But, the premise of the first question was built on two narratives that both serve the Obama/Clinton perspective on the economy:

There are two economic realities in America today. There’s been a record six straight years of job growth, and new census numbers show incomes have increased at a record rate after years of stagnation. However, income inequality remains significant, and nearly half of Americans are living paycheck to paycheck.
I’ve already hammered Lester Holt’s performance as moderator earlier this morning, but it is worth noting that the topic selection was entirely in Holt’s control.  To only have one segment on the economy and to have it framed in the context of Obama’s great job growth and “income inequality” forces the conversation into territory that only appeals to Elizabeth Warren and her students, not a manufacturing employee who lost his job in Pennsylvania last month.

After that brief segment on the economy (and trade thanks to Trump raising the issue) the conversation for the rest of the evening degenerated into discussions about Donald Trump’s tax returns, Barack Obama’s Birth certificate, a lawsuit against Trump from 1972, the amount of debt Trump has used to leverage his buildings and Hillary Clinton’s historic nomination (have you heard she’s a woman?).

Why was the discussion about Donald Trump’s tax return and not about each American’s individual return and the increased burden we will feel under Clinton’s tax increase proposal?  Or about the tax cuts proposed by Trump and how we might benefit from them?

Every American is affected by Obamacare and Hillary Clinton plans to keep the unpopular government program if not expand it. Why was there no discussion of health care policy?

When the discussion turned to terrorism, the point of departure was cybersecurity. Now, cybersecurity is an important issue, but is it the most pressing terror threat a mother or father feels when their child goes off to school or heads off to the mall? Why was there barely any discussion about increased security against domestic terror threats from ISIS and those inspired by ISIS?

Immigration ranks as the 6th most important topic for American voters and was certainly front and center during the entire Republican primary season and yet there was no discussion about our immigration policy and how it relates to our national security and our economy. Not. One. Question.

This was not just a failure of Moderator Holt but also of Donald Trump. A gifted politician knows how to take a question and pivot on it to serve their purpose. Trump has a keen instinct as to what topics resonate with the American people and that instinct has served him well these past few months. At the next debate, he needs to be better at taking a question that he knows, instinctively, that most voters don’t actually care about, expose it for what it is and then discuss a topic that will actually resonate with voters.

I think Hillary Clinton won the debate Monday night, but if the debate is about issues that the American people don’t care about, what did she really win?"

If you haven’t noticed, that’s kind of her thing.

She’s been doing it for a few decades now.

She told the world that violent crime is going down in this country.


It’s not…

From Washington Post:


Homicides in the United States went up by more than 10 percent in 2015 over the year before, while violent crime increased by nearly 4 percent in the same period, according to new statistics released Monday by the FBI.

All told, the country reported its highest estimated violent crime rate in three years, and while these numbers are far below those seen one or two decades earlier, they mark a sharp increase following two years of declines, the FBI’s summary of crime figures showed.  Good job Hillary.

Here’s more from The Daily Wire’s Aaron Bandler.


From The Daily Wire:

As the Daily Wire reported on Monday, the FBI released a new report showing that violent crime increased by 3.9 percent from 2014 to 2015, including:

Additionally, FiveThirtyEight found in the FBI’s report that 52 out of 82 cities with populations of 250,000 or more experienced an increase murder from 2014 to 2015 – and is continuing to rise in 2016 – while 26 saw a decrease in murder. Among killings per 100,000 people, the murder rate increased from 4.4 percent to 4.9 percent in the same timeframe, and the trend line shows it rising fast.

100120,1007,Many Online Polls Show That Donald Trump Won Debate Last Night Despite Media’s Defense Of Hillary,http://www.youngcons.com/many-online-polls-show-that-donald-trump-won-debate-last-night-despite-medias-defense-of-hillary/,5,"If you read Politico, watch MSNBC, or take the liberal media seriously, you probably think Trump got creamed in the debate.

If you actually watched the debate and formulated your own opinion, you know it was pretty evenly matched.

And, if you checked out the online polls, you know that a lot of people out there think Trump won the debate.

Check out some of these results. Here’s more from Weasel Zippers via Daily Mail:


CNN awarded Hillary Clinton an overwhelming victory in the first presidential debate – but most snap polls show Trump emerged victorious.

Trump and Clinton tangled over the economy, her use of a private mail server and his unwillingness to release his income tax returns on Monday night. They engaged in a vigorous back-and-forth on the debate stage at Hofstra University in Hempstead, New York, as polls showed them locked in a tight race.

However, after the debate’s end, polls conducted by a number of media websites showed their readers felt the real estate mogul came out on top.


The media has been dismissing these results by calling them “unscientific”.

Yes, technically that’s true.

But they are still an indicator of what people are thinking and it’s obviously interesting that they are all saying the same thing.

If every online snap poll said Hillary won, do you think the liberal media would dismiss them as unscientific?

I don’t think so.

We will have to wait and see what the traditional polls have to say later in the week when they start coming in.

But these online polls make it clear that Trump did better than the media is giving him credit for."
100121,1007,The Top 5 Lies We Caught Hillary Telling at Last Night’s Debate,http://www.youngcons.com/hillary-lied-many-many-times-during-last-nights-debate-heres-the-top-5-examples/,5,"Only a very confused and very uninformed person could look at Hillary’s debate performance last night and be pleased.

I mean sure, she didn’t completely fall apart.

Is that the metric we are using now?

She lied a lot of times during that debate last night.


Blatant lies too, not just little half truths here and there.

Here are five of her greatest hits courtesy of Michael Dorstewitz at BizPac Review.


From BizPac Review:

1. Iran was weeks away from a nuclear bomb “With respect to Iran, when I became secretary of state, Iran was weeks away from having enough nuclear material to form a bomb,” Clinton claimed, in an obvious attempt to puff up her own chops. 2. Clinton claimed that “tuition-free” and “debt-free” are one and the same

“I think building the middle class, investing in the middle class, making college debt free so more young people can get their education. Helping people refinance their tax — their debt from college at a lower rate.”

The Associated Press caught the former secretary of state on that particular whopper.

“Clinton has proposed making college tuition free for in-state students who go to a public college or university,” The AP reported. “But tuition free doesn’t equate to debt free. Under her plan, the government would pay for in-state tuition at public colleges and universities for students from families earning less than $125,000 a year. That would leave students still bearing the cost of room and board, which makes up more than half of the average $18,943 sticker price at a four-year public university, according to the College Board.”

3. Clinton denied her role in campaigning for the Trans-Pacific Partnership while secretary of state

Once again, The AP called Clinton out on this one.

“Trump is correct. As secretary of state, Clinton called the deal that was taking shape the ‘gold standard’ of trade agreements, in a 2012 trip to Australia, and championed the agreement in other venues around the world. She did not merely express the hope that it would turn out well,” The AP reported.

4. Clinton lied about Donald Trump’s federal income tax payments

Clinton has claimed several times while on the campaign trail that Trump pays no federal income taxes. Sound familiar? It should. That same claim was made four years ago against then-Republican presidential nominee Mitt Romney, and it’s just as false now as it was then.

5. Job creation? Clinton doesn’t have a clue

Clinton made a misstatement common among politicians — especially liberals — that small businesses create most new jobs. It is actually new businesses that do so, and this time the somewhat left-leaning Politico caught the former secretary of state.

This is just the tip of the iceberg too.

She made the ridiculous claim that tax cuts for the wealthy caused the financial crisis of 2008.

That’s not even close to being a little bit true.

Aaron Bandler wrote a great piece over at Daily Wire summing up her 9 biggest lies.

How in the world can people say she “won” this debate?

Almost everything Hillary said was either factually untrue or incredibly condescending.

The American people are wising up to this kind of nonsense.

The media has lost every shred of credibility they have during this race and this is a perfect example of why."
100122,1008,President Hillary Blacks Out,http://www.americanthinker.com/articles/2016/09/president_hillary_blacks_out.html,5,"The following scenario is what it could look like, and it does raise a few important questions.

The confrontation with the Russians has grown.  Russian ships have fired warning shots at an American aircraft carrier in the Mediterranean as the US carrier approaches the Syrian coast.

The Russians counter by moving cruise missile carrying warships into place armed with Kaliber missiles, the same ones that smashed into Aleppo killing scores of people.

And the Russians are reportedly moving troops up closer to the borders of Eastern Europe.

A critical meeting takes place in the White House at 2300 hours (11PM).  Present are President Hillary Clinton, the Secretary of State, Secretary of Defense, key White House staffers including White House chief of staff and National Security Council Advisor.  The new Director of the CIA also is there as is the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff.  The CIA Director, who is a Cabinet member, is briefing on the crisis before the Chairman presents some military options. Clinton is listening and then, all of a sudden, her head slams into the conference table.

Everything stops.  How to proceed?

Her staff summons White House doctors. To save time, her limp body is hoisted onto the large conference table. She is breathing but there is no communication. Did she have a stroke? There is no chance to do a real diagnosis in the situation room. It is urgent to get her to a hospital for treatment – the best choice is nearby George Washington University Hospital where Ronald Reagan was treated for a gunshot wound after an assassination attempt. Alternatively she can be taken to Bethesda Naval Hospital and transported either by ambulance or by helicopter (though there are no helicopters currently on the White House lawn).

Meanwhile, the Vice President is in Asia on a goodwill tour. His plane will soon be touching down in Seoul, South Korea. He is more than 20 hours from home, if he is summoned. But Air Force Two, if it changes route, will be followed immediately by Russian radars and satellites. The Kremlin will know something has happened in Washington.

Quarrels break out among the staff and with the cabinet members about what to do.  Should they call in medical help and bring equipment to the White House, instead of going to a hospital? That would depend, to some degree, on whether anybody thought this was the recurring brain clot that has disabled her before, and they might hope the crisis will pass on its own. But if she had a major stroke she must be hospitalized to survive.

Then there is the question again of the Russians – the President moving into a hospital cannot be hidden. Who would then be in charge? Might the Russians not want to exploit the obvious confusion now gripping the Executive Branch?

So the staff and the cabinet members know they have to make a number of choices, none of them good and some of them that threaten Clinton’s survival.

What decisions they make will require some level of agreement, and as Clinton lies on the table, pale and with shallow breathing, they can’t reach a conclusion. The clock is ticking. The argument is growing. Can the cabinet members take control, throw the White House staffers out of the room, and determine what to do with Clinton?

The succession laws really don’t deal with this kind of situation. If the Cabinet decides to act in the stead of Clinton, are they in fact carrying out a coup d’etat justified by the emergency?

The Secretary of State, wanting to avoid an Al Haig moment, says that the cabinet should summon the Speaker of the House, a Democrat, who stands in the line of succession after the absent Vice President. He calls the Speaker, but the speaker points out that the Twenty Fifth amendment clearly says the Vice President needs to be called in, but first the cabinet must vote that and inform Congress. “So,” says the Speaker, “I can’t oblige you guys. Follow the Constitution.”

But communications with the Vice Presidential aircraft are erratic: the North Koreans know he is inbound and they have turned on all their jammers. As soon as he lands, the Secretary of Defense reaches him on a non-secure landline. Now the Russians know -- in fact the South Koreans can’t keep quiet and in a few minutes the word is out.  Meanwhile the House Speaker also is talking to the media.  His staff told him maybe the White House was setting a trap for him, and he wanted to be clear to all that he only follows the Constitution.

At this point, unexpectedly, Clinton rouses. She is helped from the table to a chair. Her National Security Advisor briefs her, even though she is still confused. But she is also extremely angry.  She fires her Secretary of Defense on the spot for his call to the Speaker, and warns the Secretary of State that he is next. The room is chaotic. Clinton cancels the emergency meeting.  She says they were plotting a coup against her.

The Cabinet members caucus together outside the Situation Room.  Summoning Clinton’s doctor, they want to know her condition and whether she really is mentally capable.  The doctor hedges –after all there is a doctor-patient relationship to be preserved.  But the Cabinet members threaten and demand an answer.  If the doctor tells them she cannot function mentally, they will claim under the 25th Amendment that she is incapacitated, and throw the Presidency to the absent Vice President.  The doctor is threatened and finally he says that her condition cannot be determined and her mental faculties are in doubt.  A vote is taken, with the fired Secretary of Defense participating.  The two cabinet secretaries and the Director of the CIA vote her as incapcitated and immediately inform the Speaker of the House by a phone call.  Now they must wait for the Vice President to come home, and meanwhile the NSC director and the White House Staff Director call in the press and claim there has been a coup d’etat.  The nation is now in turmoil as the political crisis spirals out of control.  All but forgotten are the Russians, who are ratcheting up military pressure.  Tonight Russian troops crossed into the Ukraine heading for Kiev.  And other Russian troops move toward the border of Finland and Estonia.

100123,1008,The 'Refugee' Agenda,http://www.americanthinker.com/articles/2016/09/the_refugee_agenda.html,5,"Lately, news outlets can barely keep pace with “Muslims killing or attempting to kill Americans” stories. Arcan Cetin, a 20-year-old Muslim male, just killed five Americans at a mall in Seattle; Ahmad Khan Rahami, a 28-year-old Muslim male is in custody for attempted murder after having set off bombs in New York and New Jersey last week; Dahir Adan, a 22-year-old Muslim male, attacked and stabbed his way through a mall in Minnesota.

(Question: What do all these perpetrators have in common? Answer: military-aged males with Arab features who practice Islam. Just like Omar Mateen, Nidil Hasan, Muhammad Youssef Abdulazeez, Tamerlan Tsarnaev, Dzhokhar Tsarnaev, Syed Rizwan Farook, and others. But that’s for another day.)

We now know that Dahir Adan was a refugee from Somalia. He was welcomed into our country and repaid us by shouting “Allahu Akbar” as he stabbed and slashed nine shoppers. Last Sunday ISIS claimed that Adan was one of their own.

For reasons none can explain, liberals like Hillary Clinton, Barack Obama, and Minnesota Governor Mark Dayton simply cannot connect the dots between unfettered refugee resettlement and the threat of jihadist terrorism. Even though Adan’s terror attack came on the heels of a bomb detonation in New Jersey, a Muslim man attacking New York police with a meat cleaver, and a bomb exploding in Chelsea, Manhattan, injuring 29 civilians.

Tragic loss of life and limb by American citizens is the price being paid by innocent people for their leadership’s insistence on pursuing their agenda and those same leader’s blind spots to this dual threat. First is the threat of ISIS and other radical operatives mixing into refugee flows and coming here directly; second is that of non-radicals entering then being contacted or radicalized via other means once here. Of course those calling the shots are largely immune from the repercussions of their own decisions. Refugees are not being resettled into Chappaqua, Georgetown, Hollywood Hills, or Martha’s Vineyard.

Obama had set a goal of resettling at least 10,000 (more) refugees from Muslim nations by the end of this month. He reached that goal ahead of schedule. He went even further by raising the 2017 refugee ceiling to a dizzying 100,000. This on top of the nearly 700,000 green cards the Obama administration has issued to migrants from Muslim nations in the past five years alone.

Last year the Washington Times reported that the Obama administration’s permanent refugee resettlement efforts have been particularly strong on the Somalia-to-Minnesota path; “The State Department has helped to relocate tens of thousands of refugees from the war-torn African nation of Somalia to Minnesota, where they can take advantage of some of America’s most generous welfare and charity programs.

 But the effort is having the unintended consequence of creating an enclave of immigrants with high unemployment that is both stressing the state’s safety net and creating a rich pool of potential recruiting targets for Islamist terror groups.”

Thus making Minnesota reflective of what’s happening in Europe.

Namely, Islamic terrorism caused by Muslim migration. As Muslim populations grow, so do terror attacks. Though this connection is so simple even a caveman can see it, liberals refuse to so much as acknowledge any issues of national security and instead brand all do as bigots.

Minnesota Governor Mark Dayton declared, “Minnesota is not like it was 30, 50 years ago. Anybody who cannot accept your [Somali immigrants] right to be here should find another state.” Dayton then condemned “religious bigotry” and said, “There’s no place in Minnesota for intolerance of all Americans’ constitutional right to worship according to their beliefs.”

Apparently immigrants have a “right” to be here and its “intolerant” if you have a problem with one of your loved ones being slashed with a knife while standing in line at Macy’s.

“I ask everyone in the St. Cloud area and throughout Minnesota to rise above this atrocity and act to make religious and racial tolerance one of the ways in which Minnesotans again lead our country,” Governor Dayton added.

What Dayton, Clinton, and other liberal social planners cannot seem to grasp is the fact that Muslim refugee resettlement areas like St. Cloud, Dearborn, Michigan, and now Clearwater, Florida become active recruiting grounds for terror groups. Somalis in Minnesota are targeted by terror groups like ISIS. One such organization specifically warned of attacks on American malls, and now it’s happened.

“This population is also being targeted by Islamist terror organizations like the Islamic State and al-Shabab, a Somalia-based group with links to al Qaeda” said a U.S. official speaking on condition of anonymity, “Among Minnesota-based Somali-Americans, American converts to Islam or Somali refugees, there have been numerous convictions for various levels of collaboration with Islamist terror groups, plus reports of fighting with al-Shabab or other Islamist groups. Al-Shabab made a propaganda video warning of an attack on shopping malls around the world, including the Mall of America in Minnesota.”

In May of this year Voice of America News reported that ISIS has steadily grown stronger in Somalia and that the terror organization is now a very significant threat. In July, World Net Daily reported that Somali refugees in Minnesota regularly threaten Minnesota women with kidnapping and rape. In June, three Somalians living in Minnesota were convicted of trying to join ISIS. See the connection, liberals?

Department of Homeland Security documents show that while Hillary Clinton served as Secretary of State, over 31,000 Somali refugees were relocated to the United States. If elected, she plans on increasing the number of Muslim refugees from Syria alone by over 500%.

Breitbart News reports that under a Clinton administration, the total number of Muslim refugees permanently admitted into the U.S. could top 1 million in her first term alone.

Within the past ten days we’ve seen American men and women guilty of nothing but visiting one of our shopping malls have their faces slashed open and be stabbed repeatedly by a single ISIS convert. Yet the very idea that we should slow down our immigration roll and examine protocol and procedures to be certain we’re doing everything possible for the safety of the American people is an idea that’s rejected outright by the likes of Barack Obama and Hillary Clinton. They want to import hundreds and hundreds of thousands and do so as fast as possible even though it’s clear we don’t have adequate vetting processes and that Muslim immigrants and refugees are being targeted for recruitment by ISIS and other terror groups.

Considering that the most important job of any commander-in-chief is the safety and security of our citizens and homeland, it’s a very difficult policy agenda to understand.

100124,1008,K-12: Teaching Knowledge vs. Teaching Ideology,http://www.americanthinker.com/articles/2016/09/k12_teaching_knowledge_vs_teaching_ideology.html,5,"In 1974, Jaime Escalante took a job at Garfield High School in East Los Angeles, California.  He found himself in a challenging situation: teaching math to Hispanic students at a rundown school known for violence and drugs.  While many dismissed his students as unteachable, Escalante  pushed them to reach their potential.  He started an advanced mathematics program with a handful of students.  He was so successful that a testing service accused his students of cheating.  They weren't.  Hollywood made a fine movie out of the story called Stand and Deliver (1988).

Escalante's students were the last ones expected to succeed academically, but Escalante told them: ""I'll teach you math, and that's your language.  With that, you're going to make it.  You're going to college and sit in the first row, not the back, because you're going to know more than anybody.""

He was harassed by the usual nitwits in the Education Establishment.  They said he came to work too early, he stayed too late, his standards were too high, he was attempting the impossible, and what good could come of that?

Escalante (1930-2010) is, to put it simply, one of this country's finest teachers.  He was a great man.  It's an honor to read about him.  Everyone should know about his work.  If you are moved by nobility, and steadiness of purpose, success achieved against overwhelming odds, this guy's story will make you cry.

Needless to say, the Education Establishment should have adopted his ideas and used them throughout the country.  Instead, administrators tried to limit his influence and make him go away.

Escalante shared a lot in common with that other great maverick, John Saxon.  They had all the good ideas.  The Education Establishment hated them for this.  Anyone serious about improving a school should seek inspiration from Saxon and Escalante.

On the other hand, left-wing education consultant Heather Hackman (real name) sees all of education as a chance to advance socialist and progressive attitudes.  She speaks of ""doing climate justice work through a social justice lens.""  (Possibly, this means that if you live in a hot city, you get a higher grade on the theory that the city is hot only because of climate change.)

Hackman argues that teachers shouldn't even bother teaching (their ostensible job) if they aren't committed to promoting social justice in school.

Her website uses this slogan: ""Deep Diversity, Equity And Social Justice Consulting For A Changing World.""  Of course, ""diversity"" and ""equity"" could point at different goals, which suggests that her agenda is not well thought out.

In Hackman's telling, virtually everything associated with being a  successful student is nothing but chains imposed by racist white supremacy.

She argues that ""Grades [and] Showing Up On Time Are A Form Of White Supremacy.""  (How racist is that?  Apparently non-white people can't be punctual.)

Hackman's solution is ""to train teachers to move away from all these aspects of white privilege in education. She routinely touted the benefits of collective assessments (measuring student learning at the class level instead of determining whether each student knows the material), as well as eliminating all school grades entirely.""  Now, imagine a design school, flying school, or law school (i.e., any real school) trying these stunts.

Hackman graciously concedes that ""in the current white supremacist system, there is some expectation that teachers will know conventional English and possess other basic knowledge. As a result, she admitted modern activist teachers should try to learn those things sufficiently to get a job, but only for the purpose of infiltrating schools to change them from within.""

If you want to emphasize ideological  maneuvers, as John Dewey and his successors always preferred, then you will continually create inferior school systems and mediocre students.  That's a price that Heather Hackman is eager to pay.  And she gets paid for recommending these priorities.  However, the students themselves might prefer to move ahead in their chosen careers.  The society needs people who can do a good job and want to, as opposed to an inferior job and a bad attitude.  Heather Hackman serves her ideology ahead of the needs of society and students.

In the 1990s, Reform Math included that most bogus of all programs, MathLand.  It contained such questions as ""If math were a color, what would it be?"" and was explicitly based on the premise that girls and minorities cannot learn math.  This was precisely the premise that Escalante and Saxon repudiated.

Now, let's ask ourselves: who is the true liberal in this story?  Heather Hackman will undermine everyone by her mandatory collectivism.  Jaime Escalante and John Saxon say, no, you can bring out the best in yourself, you can reach higher, and that's the intelligent choice for you and your society.

100125,1009,LESTER HOLT’S BLATANTLY BIASED PERFORMANCE,http://www.powerlineblog.com/archives/2016/09/lester-holts-blatantly-biased-performance.php,5,"Donald Trump can’t blame his poor debate performance on Lester Holt. Nor would it be wise for him to try. Biased moderators usually win twice when the victim whines. That’s why Kellyanne Conway shrewdly praised Holt’s performance after the debate.

But Holt’s performance was not praiseworthy. Rather, it was a nakedly biased effort to aid Hillary Clinton.

The mischief began with the very first question. Holt proclaimed the state of the economy good, complained about inequality, and wanted to know what the candidates will do about it.

The question stated the premise of Hillary Clinton’s campaign: that President Obama has fixed the economy as a general matter but inequality remains (thus, of course, requiring the federal government to gain more power and enact more liberal policies). If the Clinton campaign had written the first question about the economy, it likely would have come up with this question.

Trump, of course, denies that the economy is doing well and contends that the squeeze on the middle class, not inequality, is our central problem. Holt, as was to be expected, took Clinton’s side before either candidate had even spoken.

The question didn’t really influence the course of the debate. However, other questions posed by Holt certainly did.

Holt used the topic of race in America to raise the issue of Trump’s “birtherism.” The premise of posing this question in the context of a discussion about race is that Trump’s birtherism was race-based. That’s Hillary Clinton’s position. Holt embraced it.

Even if birtherism is relevant to race, there are dozens of issues that are more relevant. Holt selected birtherism because he wanted to set up an attack on Trump, not because he wanted to discuss race.

Holt also brought up Trump’s tax returns. He set it up by saying, “Mr. Trump, we’re talking about the burden that Americans have to pay, yet you have not released your tax returns.” Actually, the candidates were not talking about “the burden that Americans have to pay.” Holt just wanted to raise another topic that he thought, correctly, would help Clinton by making Trump look bad.

Trump’s tax returns are fair game in the debates. But where was the question that might help Trump by making Clinton look bad? There was none. Yes, he asked her about the deleted emails, but only to give her a chance to respond after Trump had raised the issue.

Before the debate, the mainstream media was insisting that Holt debate the facts with Trump. I believe he did so only once, disputing Trump’s claim that he opposed the Iraq war pre-invasion.

It’s difficult to be too sympathetic to Trump here because he certainly did make mildly supportive statements about invading Iraq. Even so, Holt overstepped his proper role.

When Holt asserted that Trump supported the war, Hillary Clinton had already said so and Trump had denied it. Thus, Holt wasn’t correcting a statement that otherwise might have gone uncorrected. Instead, was jumping in, Candy Crowley, on Clinton’s side.

That’s not the job of a debate moderator. But it’s the job that liberals like Holt and Crowley assign themselves in order to help the liberal candidate.

Again, I’m not blaming Lester Holt for Trump’s poor performance. Trump should have done much better on issues like birtherism, tax returns, and his tepid initial support for the Iraq war.

But with a proper moderator, Trump probably would not have had to face the triple whammy of these matters. Or if he did, Clinton would have had to answer pointed questions from the moderator about, say, the false claims she’s made about her emails, about the overthrow of Qaddafi, about Benghazi, and/or about the “Russian reset.”

Clinton’s ally Holt asked no such questions."
100126,1009,TRUMP WINS MOST IMMEDIATE POLLS,http://www.powerlineblog.com/archives/2016/09/trump-wins-most-immediate-polls.php,5,"The consensus here at Power Line was that Donald Trump performed miserably last night. My verdict was a little less harsh, in part because I think he always performs miserably in debates, but it doesn’t seem to matter. For those who are feeling despondent this morning, the Daily Mail offers a little good news.

The newspaper collected screen shots of 19 “snap” polls conducted immediately after the debate, and in 17 of them, most respondents said Trump won the debate, often by a wide margin. It isn’t just Drudge and Breitbart; Trump also got more votes than Clinton in instant polls at Time, Slate, Variety and other liberal outlets.

I can’t explain it, other than to say that perhaps it tells us more about how people view Hillary Clinton than about how Donald Trump actually performed."
100127,1009,AFTER LAST NIGHT,http://www.powerlineblog.com/archives/2016/09/after-last-night-20.php,5,"Every observation, thought or prediction I have had on the course of political events this year may have proved wrong. My observations here can therefore probably serve most usefully as a contrary indicator, but I had a few watching last night’s incredibly painful debate and at this point I can only say I hope I’m wrong.

If you either support the defeat of Hillary Clinton or the election of Donald Trump as president, or both, I don’t know how it would be possible not to be disgusted by Trump’s performance last night. Disappointment doesn’t capture it.

Trump turned in the worst debate performance by a presidential candidate since the modern era of these televised events in 1960, and Trump’s was the worst by a long shot. What to compare it to? In my mind it harked back to President Ford’s “liberation” of Poland in his 1976 debate against Jimmy Carter, but Trump’s disaster was far worse. Ford was an incumbent president and a transparently decent man. He had nothing to prove in that regard or in his ability to discharge the duties of the office.

Not so the case with Trump. He had something to prove and he botched it. Repeatedly.

On the defensive, Trump responded at length with monologues that confirmed and amplified the charges against him. He hasn’t released his tax returns? He doesn’t pay taxes because he’s smart.

His properties have discriminated in renting to blacks? The company was just one defendant in a multiparty suit that was settled without an “admission of guilt.”

His advocacy of the birther cause demeaned our first black president? He did Obama a favor by compelling him to release his birth certificate.

He didn’t oppose the Iraq war at the time? Here he did not confirm or amplify the charge but rather chose to defend himself at bizarre length, citing Howard Stern and Sean Hannity along the way. Is anyone beyond the circle of a few former Bush administration officials going to vote for or against Trump because of his alleged position on this point? Get a grip, man.

As the wreck continued at what felt to me like excruciating length, I reflected that, in Trump’s case, character is destiny. His vanity drew him into misjudgments and missed opportunities at virtually every turn. He could not let it (any of it go). He had to vindicate himself, even if he lacked the perspective to see that his attempts at self-vindication worked out more like self-incrimination.

Secretary Clinton seemed to me poised, self-disciplined and prepared. While she couldn’t entirely control her smirking, and while some of her canned lines flopped, she excelled by contrast with Trump. She largely suppressed her inner Nurse Ratched. She demonstrated the uses of suppression and discipline in the service of a bad cause. She didn’t let it all hang out. She kept most of it in.

Edmund Burke’s famous defense of party came to mind last night: “No man, who is not inflamed by vain-glory into enthusiasm, can flatter himself that his single, unsupported, desultory, unsystematic endeavours, are of power to defeat the subtle designs and united cabals of ambitious citizens. When bad men combine, the good must associate; else they will fall, one by one, an unpitied sacrifice in a contemptible struggle.” Trump seems to flatter himself that his desultory, unsystematic endeavors can defeat the subtle designs and united cabals of his ambitious opponents.

Through the primary season I worried that Trump would prove a disgrace and embarrassment to the issues he purports to care about (the issues I care about, the issues articulated by Steve’s friend Decius). I thought we saw something of that last night more or less minus the issues."
100128,1010,Trump tries to pretend he didn’t brag about not paying taxes,https://thinkprogress.org/trump-no-taxes-deny-22d99592cc85#.63iyrf5nf,5,"Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump is the first candidate in 40 years who has refused to release his tax returns. At the presidential debate on Monday night, his Democratic rival Hillary Clinton suggested that may be because the public would see he didn’t pay any federal income taxes at all despite his self-professed wealth.
Trump seemed to admit that this was indeed the case. “That makes me smart,” he responded.
 But just after the debate, Trump was already trying to walk it back. About an hour after he made the comment, he claimed he had never said it.
Asked by CNN’s Dana Bash, “It sounds like you admitted that you hadn’t paid federal taxes and that that was smart, is that what you meant to say?” Trump didn’t try to clarify, but instead lied and said he’d never said that.
“No, I didn’t say that at all,” he responded. He then went on, “If they say I didn’t, I mean it doesn’t matter,” without clarifying who “they” refers to. But he did continue one theme: the idea that the government doesn’t deserve his tax money. “I will say this, I hate the way our government spends our taxes. Because they are wasting our money,” he said.
Taxes, of course, go to funding more than just “Iraq,” one of the wastes Trump pointed out on Monday night. They also help fund all government operations, from education to scientific research to Social Security to roads and bridges to things Trump supports like immigration enforcement. Ensuring that the wealthy pay more taxes than those who are less well off can also help tamp down on skyrocketing inequality.
If Trump has used the tax code to his advantage to get him out of paying federal income taxes, he wouldn’t be alone. In 2012, the 400 American taxpayers with the highest incomes paid an effective tax rate of just 17 percent, far lower than the on-paper 39.6 percent rate that’s supposed to be applied to income above $466,950. That’s thanks to their ability to marshal accountants and exploit loopholes like paying a lower rate on money made from investments_—_a rate Trump would make even lower."
100129,1010,The bad policy that both Clinton and Trump agreed on last night,https://thinkprogress.org/clinton-trump-debate-terror-watch-list-1ad0a47c431c#.2h1qamlhk,5,"During Monday night’s first presidential debate, there wasn’t much the two candidates were able to agree on. They sparred over Donald Trump’s tax returns and business deals and, at one point, considered whether Hillary Clinton could be blamed for everything.
But there was one exception. In a rare moment of agreement, both candidates endorsed an error-prone proposal to restrict gun purchases among people who appear on a problematic “no fly, no buy” or terror watch list that’s maintained by the federal government.
CLINTON: We need to pass a prohibition on anyone on the terrorist watch list from being able to buy a gun.
TRUMP: I agree with you. When a person is on a watch list or no fly list, I think we have to look very strongly at no fly lists. I tend to agree with that.
This government list was compiled after the September 11, 2001 attacks, when U.S. intelligence agencies pooled their lists of suspected terrorists into one database maintained by the FBI and the National Counterterrorism Center (NCTC).
Checking gun buyers against this terror watch list has bipartisan backing. And in theory, the idea seems sound. After all, who wants to give a gun to someone who can’t fly on a plane because they’re on a scary watch list?
But in practice, there are a lot of issues with ever-growing watch list. For one, it can lead to additional racial or religious profiling. There are an estimated 700,000 to 1.5 million people on the watch list, the majority of whom are immigrants and foreigners. The NCTC found some evidence that only 25,000 people_—_or 2.3 percent_—_of the 1.1 million people on the consolidated watch list are American citizens or legal permanent residents.
Some of the flagged names may be people who otherwise wouldn’t be on the no-fly list, but who have the same name as other individuals. There could also be name mismatches in the system. Reporters including Stephen Hayes and Drew Griffin have encountered this nightmare. Rep. John Lewis (D-GA) was once on the list. And even the late Sen. Ted Kennedy was once misidentified as someone on a selectee list required undergo additional security screening before boarding planes.
Classified documents obtained by the Intercept found that the terrorist watch list includes 280,000 people whom the government says have no recognized terrorist affiliation at all.
 The American Civil Liberties Union has challenged recent congressional bills that rely on the federal government’s use of the watch list system, arguing that the list is unreliable since it relies on “vague and overbroad criteria and secret evidence to place individuals on blacklists without a meaningful process to correct government error and clear their names.”
The ACLU also pointed out that an internal 2013 government document showed that Dearborn, Michigan, which is home to a large population of Arab-Americans, “was second only to new York City in the number of people on the government’s ‘known or suspected terrorist’ watch list.”
What’s more, there’s not a lot of evidence that restricting gun purchases this way would prevent violence. People could still buy guns, including assault weapons, at gun shows or online because of a background check loophole."
100130,1010,Former Miss Universe says watching Trump run for president ‘has been like a bad dream’,https://thinkprogress.org/alicia-machado-trump-88b9d0de2eee#.bnx3obfx3,5,"Alicia Machado, a former Miss Universe winner, didn’t expect to become one of the central stories after the first presidential debate on Monday night.
On a call with press on Tuesday, she said she was “really surprised” when Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton brought up the story of Donald Trump disparaging her for her slight weight gain while she wore the crown. Clinton said toward the end of the debate, “One of the worst things he said was about a woman in a beauty contest. He called this woman ‘Miss Piggy.’ Then he called her ‘Miss Housekeeping,’ because she was Latina.”
Speaking in a mix of English and Spanish, Machado said, “It made me cry.”
She’s happy to be sharing the experience, she says, as she is now a Clinton supporter. But it’s been strange to see the man she says abused her for the year that she was Miss Universe all over TV screens as he’s made a bid for the White House.
“For me, this election [is] like a bad dream,” she said. “I never imagined 20 years later I’d be in this position, I’d be in this moment watching this guy again doing stupid things and stupid comments and so…chauvinist.”
In previous interviews with the media, Machado has described how Trump’s taunts_—_calling her “Miss Piggy” and “an eating machine”_—_pushed her back into anorexia and bulimia, which she says she struggled with in the lead up to the pageant. On the media call Tuesday, she said she spent three or four years trying to overcome those illnesses after the experience of working for Trump as Miss Universe.
She said she hasn’t had direct contact with Trump since she stepped down after her tenure. “I don’t want to see him anymore either.”
Machado also noted that when Clinton brought her story up during the debate, Trump feigned ignorance, saying, “Where did you find this?”
“Maybe he doesn’t remember me… Maybe he doesn’t remember a girl of 18 years,” she said. “But I remember. I’ll always remember.”
She called him very vulgar and rude, constantly insulting her and treating her like a new toy. “He treated me like a thing, he treated me like garbage,” she said."
100131,1001,Donald Trump was sued for racial discrimination in the 1970s and he's lying about it now,http://www.dailykos.com/stories/2016/9/28/1575562/-Donald-Trump-was-sued-for-racial-discrimination-in-the-1970s-and-he-s-lying-about-it-now,6,"Donald Trump was not at his most convincing—even in a pretty unconvincing debate—when he said it was no big deal that he and his father had been sued by the Justice Department for racial discrimination in the 1970s because “I settled that lawsuit with no admission of guilt.” Oh, you didn’t admit guilt, eh? But that’s not the only problem with his answer, which the Washington Post’s fact checker has awarded four Pinocchios. 

Trump made two key points: the “no admission of guilt” thing and that “we, along with many, many other companies throughout the country—it was a federal lawsuit—were sued.” In reality:

… the suit was squarely aimed at the Trumps and their company; it was titled: United States of America v. Fred C. Trump, Donald Trump and Trump Management, Inc.
As far as admission of guilt, the point was to change the Trumps’ behavior and get them to rent to black people, because they really were egregious discriminators:

According to Kranish and Fisher, the Justice Department lawsuit was “one of the most significant racial bias cases of the era.” It was based on evidence gathered by testers for the New York City Human Rights Commission, who documented that black people were told no apartments were available in Trump properties while white testers at the same time were immediately offered apartments. In a sampling of 10 Trump buildings, only 1 to 3.5 percent of the occupants were minorities, making it one of the strongest cases the Justice Department had ever seen for violations of the Fair Housing Act.
Trump fought the suit, tried to counter-sue, and finally settled, only to wind up back in court because he and his father weren’t complying with the terms of the settlement. So “no admission of guilt” boils down to “really damn guilty, but not admitting it.” And “we, along with many, many other companies … were sued” boils down to United States of America v. Fred C. Trump, Donald Trump and Trump Management, Inc. 

The man lies. In this case, he lies about his record of racial discrimination. And that’s particularly relevant when you consider the racist campaign he’s running. Donald Trump has both racist words and racist deeds to his name, and there’s every reason to believe President Trump would back racist laws."
100132,1001,The next debate is a town hall: Trump's worst nightmare,http://www.dailykos.com/stories/2016/9/28/1575485/-The-next-debate-is-a-town-hall-Trump-s-worst-nightmare#read-more,6,"When Hillary Clinton kicked off her presidential bid last year, the press corps literally chased her ""Scooby"" van all over the place trying to catch pictures of her. Why? Because instead of talking to them, she was talking to actual voters, specifically at round tables like the one she did with young DREAM activists within the first several weeks of her campaign.

It was no accident. She thrived in these one-on-one interactions—connecting with real people played to Clinton’s strengths. And so the entire roll out of her candidacy was orchestrated around them.

Trump, by contrast, did YUGE rallies, bragging about crowd size and touting every new poll that came out. He also literally “phoned it in” to friendly shows and outlets like Morning Joe, Fox News, and compromised his standards on occasion to call in to a Sunday program. He specialized in talking at people, not with them.

The next presidential debate on October 9 will be a town hall format, which holds pitfalls for any candidate. But for Trump, talking to anyone who doesn't absolutely adore him and think he's tremendous(!) is Kryptonite.

Trump doesn't like people who don't believe in his tremendousness. It messes with his worldview. How do we know? Just look at his juvenile effort to shame Alicia Machado—the Latina Miss Universe he once disparaged as ""Miss Piggy"" and ""Miss Housekeeper""—after Clinton wiped the floor with him during the debate for demeaning Machado.

Can you pitch in $6 to help make sure Hillary Clinton is the next president of the United States?

Frustrated you don't live in a swing state? No matter where you live, MoveOn has a great way for you to get involved where it matters most. Check it out!

Now just imagine someone like Machado asking Trump if he feels regret for degrading women for gaining ""a massive amount of weight."" Remember how well that went for Fox’s Megyn Kelly during the GOP primary? Or imagine gold star parents asking Trump if he regrets attacking Khizr and Ghazala Khan.

Trump is like a walking Dumpster fire just waiting for some gasoline to unleash a pyrotechnic eruption. Nothing was more evident during Monday night's debate than his bottomless need to defend himself against even the smallest unflattering remark, like the fact that he started his company with a ""small"" million dollar loan from his Daddy.

His outsized defensiveness isn't occasional or optional, it's compulsive. You can count on it every time. That's not something you can train out of someone in a couple weeks. In fact, Trump's campaign staff couldn't even properly prep him for the very controlled environment of one moderator and one opponent. Relatively speaking, a town hall will be more like pushing that Dumpster fire over a field of land mines.

In the meantime, Clinton's interactions with real voters have been so powerful that her campaign has regularly featured them in videos and ads. Remember the video of her meeting with the ""Mothers of the Movement"" for Black Lives that played at the Democratic National Convention? Or this ad of Clinton talking to a little girl about bullying at a town hall event?

Granted, some of the queries Clinton will get during this debate will inevitably come from voters who don't like her. But Clinton was the perfect Happy Warrior throughout Monday's debate even as Trump lobbed rocks at her like a petulant child. Former Mexican president Vicente Fox observed that it was like watching ""the beauty and the beast.""

On October 9, ""the beast"" will be unleashed on regular citizens—a performance that’s sure to draw endless follow-up interviews from Trump reinforcing how right he was to be so beastly."
100133,1001,"Not only is 'stop and frisk' unconstitutional, it doesn't work, no matter what Trump or Giuliani say",http://www.dailykos.com/stories/2016/9/28/1575387/-Not-only-is-stop-and-frisk-unconstitutional-it-doesn-t-work-no-matter-what-Trump-or-Giuliani-say#read-more,6,"There are almost as many things wrong with Donald Trump’s defense of expanding “stop and frisk” as there are words in this back and forth between Trump and moderator Lester Holt.

HOLT: Your two -- your two minutes expired, but I do want to follow up. Stop-and-frisk was ruled unconstitutional in New York, because it largely singled out black and Hispanic young men.

TRUMP: No, you're wrong. It went before a judge, who was a very against-police judge. It was taken away from her. And our mayor, our new mayor, refused to go forward with the case. They would have won an appeal. If you look at it, throughout the country, there are many places where it's allowed.

HOLT: The argument is that it's a form of racial profiling.

TRUMP: No, the argument is that we have to take the guns away from these people that have them and they are bad people that shouldn't have them.

These are felons. These are people that are bad people that shouldn't be -- when you have 3,000 shootings in Chicago from January 1st, when you have 4,000 people killed in Chicago by guns, from the beginning of the presidency of Barack Obama, his hometown, you have to have stop-and-frisk.

You need more police. You need a better community, you know, relation. You don't have good community relations in Chicago. It's terrible. I have property there. It's terrible what's going on in Chicago.
The problem, of course, is that America doesn’t require felons to wear a scarlet “F” (or at least, pre-Trump America does not). “Stop and frisk” targets people who look suspicious to the police, and the record shows that looking suspicious is more or less synonymous with being black or Latino. 

And then there’s the fact that “stop and frisk” doesn’t work. ...

Want to reach millennial voters in swing states to win this election? No matter where you live, volunteer with NextGen Climate to make phone calls, texts and other ways to help out.

“Stop and frisk” absolutely was ruled unconstitutional because the way it was applied was absolutely discriminatory.

Among people who were stopped by police, 52 percent were black, 31 percent were Hispanic and 10 percent were white. These stops were disproportionate to the racial breakdown of New York City in 2010: about 23 percent black, 29 percent Hispanic and 33 white.
Blacks were twice as likely to be stopped, but those stops were less likely to find a weapon. Overall, 98.5 percent of all stops failed to produce a weapon. At the peak of the program, over 675,000 New Yorkers were stopped for no reason in one year.

That’s why Bill de Blasio didn’t just end the program, he ran on ending the program.

And when it comes to the relationship between “stop and frisk” and decreasing crime, the picture is a lot murkier than Donald Trump suggests.

While Donald ascribes “stop and frisk” to his pal Rudy, the real lover of the program was “that little guy,” Michael Bloomberg.

In 2002, when Michael Bloomberg — still a firm believer in stop-and-frisk's ability to ""keep New York safe"" — first took office as mayor, New Yorkers were stopped by the police 97,296 times, according to the NYCLU. Stops peaked in 2011, still under Bloomberg's purview, with 685,724 stops. 
But while Bloomberg was ramping “stop and frisk” up, and up, and up, crime was not coming down, down, down. In fact, after a drop in 2006, crime fluctuated and more or less flattened out, even though stops were still increasing rapidly. It was only after “stop and frisk” was steeply reduced, that crime began to fall again. When the murder rate leveled out in 2013, it did so at a rate that was a fraction of what was experienced in the best years under Giuliani. Overall the correlation between levels of stop and frisk and the crime rate is pretty much nonexistent.

While it’s true that crime began to fall steeply around when stop and frisk was first officially implemented in New York City, the timing between “stop and frisk” doesn’t actually match when things started improving rapidly.

Mayor Rudy Giuliani and NYPD Commissioner Bill Bratton credit their broken-windows-style reforms for crime’s sharp decline after taking office in 1994. But scholars are quick to note the trend actually began in 1990.
“Stop and frisk” didn’t start a wave. It came late to a wave that was already underway, and stop and frisk was a local program while crime was decreasing nationally.

In the early 1990s, U.S. crime rates had been on a steep upward climb since the Lyndon B. Johnson presidency. … 

Then crime rates went down. And then they kept going down.

By decade’s end, the homicide rate plunged 42 percent nationwide.
“Stop and frisk” had nothing to do with it. Couldn’t have had anything to do with it. Because the decrease happened just as quickly, and sometimes more so, in areas where nothing like the New York plan was implemented.

Giuliani and Bratton were in the right place at the right time to collect the credit. It doesn’t mean they did anything to deserve it. They were in the nation’s news capital when things in the nation were improving. That’s it.

And one other thing ...

By virtually any metric, Americans now live in one of the least violent times in the nation’s history.
Though thanks to the 24/7 news channels, it’s hard to convince anyone that they, and especially their children, are much, much safer than a few decades ago.

And that news certainly hasn’t reached Apocalypse Now Trump. "
100134,1002,Donald Trump Zones in on Populist Contrast with Hillary Clinton Post-Debate: ‘Follow the Money’,http://www.breitbart.com/big-government/2016/09/28/donald-trump-zones-populist-contrast-hillary-clinton-post-debate-follow-money/,6,"NEW YORK CITY, New York — In a series of three campaign events post debate, Republican presidential nominee Donald J. Trump rolled out a new campaign theme highlighting his populist nationalism and contrasting that with Hillary Clinton’s elitist globalism.
Angel Mom Michelle Root, whose daughter Sarah Root was killed by an illegal alien, joined Trump on stage in Council Bluffs, Iowa, to help paint the picture of what the world be like if Hillary Clinton were elected president.

“I just wanted to say thank you everybody for turning out for Mr. Trump,” she said. “Hillary called me deplorable and irredeemable. She is not a friend to women, I just want to tell you that right now. The Obama-Clinton policies released the man that killed my daughter after he showed up at the borders. Then after he killed my daughter, they released him again. Now where is he? Nobody knows. Donald Trump is the only person that cared about us when no one else could and would. If Hillary wins, how many more girls are going to die? How many more women will die at the hands of their policies? Thank you, thank you Mr. Trump.”

When Trump took the stage, he lit into Hillary Clinton with a stronger-than-ever line of attack focused on her deep corruption related to the Clinton Cash narrative—a narrative that Clinton and debate moderator Lester Holt conveniently avoided on Monday night—honing his new key phrase: “Follow The Money.”

“We are going to take on the special interests, the lobbyists, and the corrupt corporate media that have rigged the system against every single American,” Donald Trump said on stage in Council Bluffs, Iowa.

He continued:

I’ve been reading stories over the last couple of days that are so inaccurate and so dishonest, I’ve never seen anything like it in my life and I’m willing to take it on because—and I didn’t need it, believe me I didn’t need it. I have a great company, I built this great company and somebody said ‘you know he could be at a point where he’s enjoying the fruits of his labor’ and here I am working harder than ever before.

I’m like a lot of people in the different rooms and different stadiums where 18 years ago their wages and real wages were higher than they are today. They had one job, now they have two jobs and they’re working harder—much harder—and they’re making much less money. That’s what’s happened in our country and the only thing I can say is I’m also working harder. After noting he’s spent tens of millions of dollars of his own money of his campaign, he says it’s because “we’re not going to be controlled.”

“We’re not going to be controlled,” Trump reiterated. “We’re not going to be controlled. We’re going to take our country back and it’s going to be a beautiful thing. This is a movement. We have a movement going on like I think they’ve never seen before.”

From there, Trump noted that his vision for the country is a government that serves the people—not one that serves the politicians like the way the Clintons have used government to their own personal benefit.

“We are going to create a new government that serves you, your family, and your country,” Trump said. “We’re going to lower taxes by a lot, less regulation, more affordable childcare, fair trade deals, secure borders, thriving family farms—millions and millions of new jobs. We are going to end the Clinton Corruption—total corruption—“

After Trump had to stop for nearly a full minute as the crowd of thousands chanted “LOCK HER UP! LOCK HER UP! LOCK HER UP!” Trump continued by noting it’s “horrible, horrible what’s happened to this country” and that he, unlike Clinton will “restore dignity and honesty to government service.”

“Hillary Clinton is an insider fighting for her donors and her insiders,” Trump said, but “mostly fighting for herself. I am an outsider fighting for you. We’re fighting together. We’re fighting together.”

From there, he launched his new campaign theme: “Everything you need to know about Hillary Clinton can be understood with this simple phrase: Follow The Money.”

“Follow The Money,” a reference back to investigators who look for motive in a certain wrongdoing by someone, is what several Trump aides tell Breitbart News going to be a huge new focus of the campaign. Trump is going to, since Monday night’s debate at Hofstra University an hour away from here on Long Island leading up to the next debate in St. Louis, they say, highlight the contrast of how Hillary Clinton stands up for special interests so as to enrich herself while he stands up for ordinary American workers. The populist pitch has been common throughout his campaign, but aides say to expect a reinvigorated triple down version of it in the coming weeks.

Trump is fighting for the everyman, while Clinton is fighting for herself, they say will be the message. And all of Clinton’s actions to take the conversation off the economy and jobs and national security—and onto trivial personal squabbles that Trump has had over the years—play right into their hands: He’s the serious candidate, they say, fighting for Americans and talking about real issues.

While the dishonest mainstream media may believe Hillary Clinton won the debate because she landed a couple decent punches on Trump on nonsense issues, Trump spent the night and the days since showing he’s concerned about Americans’ economic prospects, their safety, their security and their families.

And as such, he’s expanding his chances electorally and is planning a western trip that will focus on several states he’s doing well in so far—like Nevada and Arizona—as well states nobody in politics thought he had a chance in before like New Mexico and Colorado. Trump’s succeeded, they believe, in Monday night’s debate at one thing for sure: He connected to many Americans who feel like the system is broken and nobody cares…except for him.

“In her campaign for President, Hillary Clinton has received $100 million dollars in contributions from Wall Street and the hedge funds,” Trump continued in his Council Bluffs speech. “She received $4.1 million in speaking fees from financial firms. I’d like to see what she said. Where are the papers? Bernie—Bernie was asking for the papers, but Bernie gave up.”

As Trump was saying this, Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders—who failed his bid to beat Clinton for the Democratic nomination thanks to a lopsided effort by the Democratic National Committee (DNC) to tilt the scales in Clinton’s favor, as evidenced by leaked emails published right before the Democratic National Convention—Clinton and a defeated and surrendered Sanders appeared together in New Hampshire.

“The same groups paying Bill and Hillary for their speeches were lobbying the federal government,” Trump continued:

Twenty-two groups paying Bill Clinton for speeches lobbied the State Department while Hillary was Secretary of State. And don’t forget the Clinton contributors were appointed to advisory boards by Secretary Clinton – and guess what? They wrote checks. The favors were granted and all of these people or at least a lot of them wrote checks. She even gave up 20 percent of Uranium—you know what happens with Uranium, don’t you?—and who controls that 20 percent? Russia. Russia. Russia. She disgraced the office of Secretary of State by putting it up for sale — and if she ever got the chance, she would put the Oval Office up for sale too and nobody has any doubt about it. We can’t let that happen.

Trump campaign sources tell Breitbart News to contrast what Trump laid out in Iowa—and later on Wednesday in Wisconsin—back to what he detailed in Melbourne, Florida, on Tuesday in an uplifting policy-focused speech. That combination, they say, will help paint a picture of someone who is fighting for American workers against what Trump says is the “rigged political system.” The everyman warrior, if you will, is taking on all comers: The media, the politicians, the lobbyists, foreign influence agents, and anyone or anything else that represents a threat to America. In other words, it’s Trump against the world. “Our country is filled with so many amazing people, people who lift us up and inspire us,” Trump said at the Florida rally with thousands in attendance, before calling out to his friend former New York City Mayor Rudy Giuliani in the audience. He then contrasted Clinton’s defense of the status quo with his specific policy plans that he’s been laying out in detailed policy-laden speeches throughout the past several months, while Clinton has run a policy-free campaign.

“Ours is truly a special country,” Trump added a moment later:

And we must never stop fighting to keep the American dream alive. Never. Never. Unfortunately now for too many Americans the American dream is now out of reach. It’s not working. Our country isn’t working. So many things are going wrong.

Last night when I debated Secretary Clinton on America’s future, for 90 minutes I watched her very carefully and I also was holding back—I didn’t want to do anything to embarrass her—but I watched her and she was stuck in the past.

For 90 minutes, on issue after issue, Hillary Clinton defended the terrible status quo while I laid out our plan—all of us together—to bring jobs, security and prosperity back to the American people. For 90 minutes she argued against change while I call for dramatic change. We have to have dramatic change. We have to get rid of Obamacare. We have to strengthen up our depleted military—it’s in such bad shape—we’re going to do a lot of great things folks. Trump detailed several polls that showed he won the debate, before he again laid out the contrasts with Clinton.

“I watched last night, I found it so interesting—I knew I was going into a situation where you were going to have one of the largest audiences in the history of television and I took a deep breath and I pretended I was talking to my family, I just blocked it all out,” Trump said.

He continued:

It’s very interesting. And she was talking about what she was going to do to get rid of ISIS, what she was going to do on childcare, what she was going to do on all these different things. And I kept saying, for 26 years you’ve been doing nothing. Nothing. For 26 years, she’s done nothing.

When she ran for the Senate in New York, New York was having a big problem keeping jobs because her husband signed NAFTA and NAFTA was draining the jobs out of our country going to Mexico and other places but NAFTA was a disaster—probably the worst trade deal ever signed by anybody anywhere in the world. NAFTA was a disaster.

She promised running for the Senate years ago 200,000 jobs for upstate New York. It was a disaster. Not only didn’t they come, but they lost so many jobs—you have to see it now. It’s so sad when you see what happened to upstate New York. It is a disaster. The companies have left and gone to Mexico and other places, the jobless situation is horrible and she said she was going to do something about it and the day after the election it was like ‘bye-bye.’ And that’s exactly what would happen if she ever won.

After walking rally goers through how “we can’t let that happen,” because “we know her too well,” Trump called Clinton “the candidate of yesterday.”

“And ours is the campaign and we are the people of the future,” Trump said, adding:

Hillary Clinton defended every major failure that she helped to create. She defended the Iran deal, one of the worst deals ever. She defended her role in unleashing ISIS. She is responsible along with Barack Obama—they created a vacuum by getting out of Iraq which they should have never been in in the first place. And does everybody believe me, I was against going into Iraq.

It was so well-documented, and Sean Hannity is now saying ‘he was absolutely against it’ and nobody wants to call him because nobody wants to hear that. But she defended the conditions of our inner cities where African American families are living in a situation where nobody should be forced to live in and what’s happened is government led by Democrats should be ashamed of themselves.

Trump then detailed how Clinton’s “only experience is at failure,” and how she “bragged” about having “traveled all over the world.”

“It’s true, she traveled all over the world,” Trump said. “And you know what it got us? It got us nothing. It got us debt and it got us death. We have death and debt. And unemployment. We have all bad things. And I said last night, I said ‘You know, Secretary: You are experienced. But it’s bad experience because everything you did turned out bad.’”

Trump, later in the speech, “summed up” his “economic agenda” in “three beautiful words”— “jobs, jobs, jobs”—and then explained his positive change policy agenda:

We will cut your taxes, and let you deduct the cost of childcare, it’s about time. We will reduce regulations and create millions of new jobs for our country. We will unleash American energy adding trillions in new wealth for our workers. We are going to shrink our trade deficit and protect American manufacturing which is being led to slaughter—being led to slaughter. Florida has lost one in five manufacturing jobs since NAFTA. That’s the economic legacy of Bill and Hillary Clinton, folks.

The tax, trade, energy and regulatory reforms I propose will create at least 25 million new jobs over the next 10 years—and that will happen. Let me tell what else we’re going to do: We’re going to repeal and replace the horrible Obamacare. Clinton on the other hand wants to expand the Obamacare disaster and put the government completely in charge of America’s healthcare.

Two other major reforms I’m proposing are school choice and ending Common Core. We’re going to end Common Core. I want every disadvantaged child in this country, including every poor Hispanic child in this country and every poor African American child in this country to be able to attend the public, private, magnet, or religious school of their choice. It’s the great civil rights issue of our time."
100135,1002,How Donald Trump Won the Debate,http://www.breitbart.com/big-government/2016/09/28/how-donald-trump-won-the-debate/,6,"Frank Luntz utilizes an unusual apparatus to definitively evaluate who won a political debate: He takes a small sample of voters, hooks them up to an electronic device, turns on a TV, and carefully tabulates all the moments when they click “like” and “not like” while a politician speaks.
It’s a very visual, very TV-friendly presentation by Luntz, with demonstrative metrics, plenty of scientific-sounding soundbites, and all sorts of ready-made clips of the candidates saying and doing whatever Luntz deems their best and worst.

It’s also entirely meaningless.

If elections were decided like a prizefight and judged on a 10-point “must” system, then Luntz’s system would have merit.  (For those who stopped watching boxing when Iron Mike Tyson became a cannibal, here’s a quick refresher: During a professional prizefight, three judges score who won each round, with the victor getting 10 points and the loser getting nine.  If the fight doesn’t end by knockout, then the judges’ cards are tabulated after the final round, and the boxer with the most points is declared the victor.)

But that’s not how elections work.

Elections aren’t decided by adding-up a series of little things; they’re decided by our lasting, long-term impressions of each candidate – i.e. who they are, why they’re running, what they believe in, and what they care about. They’re decided by big things.

Consider: We don’t cast ballots immediately after a TV debate.  Instead, we turn-off the television and go to bed.

This is critically important when determining who “won” a presidential debate, and the reason why Luntz’s methodology is a useless evaluator of a candidate’s performance: It evaluates the wrong metrics.

Donald Trump’s goal isn’t to win a second-by-second comparison with Hillary Clinton.  It’s not to out-jab Clinton on policy points.  And it’s not to get random voters to click one way or another on Luntz’s machine.

Trump’s goal is to position his candidacy for victory in November.  Nothing more, nothing less – and if you’re missing this distinction, then you’re analyzing the wrong metrics.

Trump’s genius is in branding.  He’s probably the best branding expert in modern political history.  He’s astonishingly good at it.

Jeb Bush is “low energy.”  Donald Trump is a “winner.”  Ted Cruz is “lyin’.”  Hillary Clinton is “crooked.”  Marco Rubio is “little” and a “choker.”

We could argue about the accuracy of his branding, but that’s irrelevant.  Political campaigns are a perception-driven enterprise.  And in the first presidential debate, Donald Trump out-branded Hillary Clinton.

It wasn’t even close.

Throughout the GOP primaries, all the so-called political experts on Fox News, CNN, MSNBC and the major networks were dumbfounded: How is it that Trump could perform so poorly in the dozen-or-so TV debates, yet continue to win when ballots are cast?  The New York billionaire never won a debate in the eyes of these experts – but inexplicably kept winning elections!  What gives?

It’s because Trump recognizes that the goal isn’t to “win” a second-by-second, or minute-by-minute, or point-by-point policy debate.  It’s to brand yourself – and also brand others – in a way that positions your candidacy for electoral success.

In the first presidential debate, Hillary Clinton won a healthy plurality of the minute-by-minute political barbs, especially in the second-half.  She had Trump on the defense.  She stuck to her talking points like her husband sticks to an intern; Trump went off-message and was prone to rambling.

So if you were scoring this debate like Luntz did – or if you were scoring it like a Las Vegas boxing judge – then Hillary Clinton won in a landslide.

But ask yourself this question: How did Trump brand himself?

Well, he’s certainly the nontraditional candidate on the ballot.  He’s new.  He’s an outsider.  He’s exciting.  He doesn’t talk or act like a traditional politician.  He’s a businessman – and he strongly believes that America is heading in the wrong direction, and desperately needs change.

How was Hillary Clinton branded?

She’s the politician who has been talking about the same issues for 30 years… without solving any of them.  She’s a member of the political elite.  She talks and sounds just like all the other politicians.  She’s smug, smart and self-satisfied, and clearly believes that those of us who are not members of the political elite are beneath her.

Yes, Hillary Clinton is prepared – but she’s prepared to continue the status quo.

Now, ask yourself: After the debate, which of these aforementioned brand attributes were cemented?

For Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump… pretty much all of ‘em.

In politics – and in branding – it’s not what you say, but how you make people feel.

Trump understands this.  He’s a genius at destination branding.

This is why Trump tends to do poorly when people like Luntz grade a debate mere moments after it’s over, but does much better a few days later, when voters can reflect on their impressions: When we remember all that what was said and done, we recall the emotive elements more clearly than the second-by-second comparisons.

Earlier in the primaries, it didn’t really matter if Jeb Bush out-talked Donald Trump on policy points.  What mattered was the long-term branding that Trump cemented: Jeb Bush is a boring, low-energy legacy politician, whereas Donald Trump is the fresh-thinking outsider, a savvy, successful businessman, and an Alpha Male with an insatiable desire to make America great again.

A similar fate befell Ted Cruz – which was remarkable, because the Texas Senator is an enormously skillful point-by-point debater.  But because of Trump, Ted Cruz – the Tea Party Darling, and stalwart, lifelong conservative who had won arguments before the Supreme Court – was transformed into Lyin’ Ted,  a nasty, petty, argumentative fink who doesn’t get along with anyone and can’t get anything done on Capitol Hill.

(Again, this isn’t intended as a knock on Cruz or Bush; it’s simply noting the potency of Trump’s branding.)

Political pundits in the mainstream media love to bloviate about a candidate’s gender-gap with women, presumably because most of the time, it’s the Republican candidate who is trailing.  (You’ve probably noted that these pundits rarely mention when the Democratic candidate has a similar-sized gender-gap with males.)  But the 2016 election is all about a different kind of gap.

This is the gap that will decide the election: An empathy gap.

Long after the debate is over, you “feel” that Trump understands that the country is headed in the wrong direction.  You “feel” that Trump is genuinely outraged by America’s decline, and come hell or high water, he’ll dedicate his presidency to making America great again.  You “feel” that Trump is an authentic, one-of-a-kind outsider with unbridled bravado. You “feel” that Trump will shake-up the status quo and implement real, long-lasting changes.  From immigration to trade, from waging war on ISIS to renegotiating trade bills, from creating jobs to restoring law and order, Donald Trump “feels” what we feel.

That’s the brand he built – and is continuing to build.

It’s an eye-popping contrast to the brand Hillary Clinton is building (both on her own and with Trump’s support): Hillary is the ultimate DC insider who knows everything better than we do.  She looks down on people like us.  Yes, she knows all of the issues and all of the problems facing our country… but only because she’s been talking about them for 30 years, instead of actually solving them.  She deserves the White House, dammit… and shame on those racist, sexist, xenophobic “deplorables” for making her work so hard for it!

Her utter lack of empathy is Mrs. Clinton’s fatal flaw: We don’t care how much she knows, because we know she doesn’t care about us.

On a visceral, emotive level, we’ve felt this all along about Hillary.  It’s why a junior senator from Illinois came out of nowhere and beat her in 2008.  It’s why an over-aged socialist nearly toppled her in 2016: Say what you want about Bernie Sanders, but he was 100 percent authentic in his beliefs – because he genuinely desired to transform America.

But Hillary Clinton is all about Hillary Clinton.  Always has been.  Always will be.

Donald Trump won the debate, but only if you know what you’re looking for."
100136,1002,James Pinkerton – The Democrats vs. The Deplorables: The New Class Struggle Comes to the Midwest  ,http://www.breitbart.com/2016-presidential-race/2016/09/28/james-pinkerton-the-democrats-vs-the-deplorables-the-new-class-struggle-comes-to-the-midwest/,6,"The Democrats, once the party of working people, are now a party dominated by environmentalists and multiculturalists. And I can prove it.
As we shall see, when Democrats must choose between their old loyalty, providing jobs for workers, and their new loyalty, favoring politically-correct constituency groups—they choose the PC groups.

Indeed, the old assumptions about the Democrats as the party of labor are nowadays so tangled and conflicted that the unions themselves are divided. Some unions are sticking with their blue-collar heritage, but more are aligning themselves with the new forces of political correctness—and oh, by the way, big money.

The proposed Dakota Access Pipeline, running through four states—from western North Dakota to southern Illinois—would create an estimated 4,500 unionized jobs.  That is to say, good jobs at good wages: The median entry-level salary for a pipeline worker in North Dakota is $38,924.

Yet the advancement of what was once called the “labor movement” is no longer a Democratic priority.  The new priorities are heeding the goals of “progressive” groups—in this instance, Native Americans and the greens. Indeed, this new progressive movement is so strong that even many unions are climbing aboard the bandwagon, even if that means breaking labor’s united front.

To illustrate this recent rupture, here’s a headline from the The Huffington Post: “Dakota Access Pipeline Exposes Rift In Organized Labor.” Let’s let Huffpo labor reporter Dave Jamieson set the scene:

The nation’s largest federation of labor unions upset some of its own members last week by endorsing the construction of the Dakota Access pipeline in North Dakota. Some labor activists, sympathetic to Native American tribes and environmentalists, called upon the AFL-CIO to retract its support for the controversial project.

In response to the criticism, Sean McGarvey, head of the AFL-CIO’s building-trades unions, fired right back; speaking of pipeline opponents, McGarvey declared that they have…

…once again seen fit to demean and call for the termination of thousands of union construction jobs in the Heartland.  I fear that this has once again hastened a very real split within the labor movement.

Yes, it’s become quite a fracas within the House of Labor: so much for the old slogan, “Solidarity Forever!” We can note that typically, it’s the old-style construction unions—joined, perhaps, by other industrial workers, if not the union leadership—who support construction projects, while the new-style public-employee unions side with the anti-construction activists.

In the meantime, for its part, the Democratic Party has made a choice: It now firmly sides with the new progressives. To cite just one ‘frinstance, we can examine the July 2016 Democratic national platform, released at the Philadelphia convention. That document includes a full 16 paragraphs on “climate change,” as well as 14 paragraphs on the rights and needs of “indigenous tribal nations.” Here’s one of those paragraphs; as we can readily see, Democrats are striving mightily to synthesize the demands of both groups, green and red:

We are committed to principles of environmental justice in Indian Country and we recognize that nature in all its life forms has the right to exist, persist, maintain, and regenerate its vital cycles. We call for a climate change policy that protects tribal resources, protects tribal health, and provides accountability through accessible, culturally appropriate participation and strong enforcement. Our climate change policy will cut carbon emission, address poverty, invest in disadvantaged communities, and improve both air quality and public health. We support the tribal nations efforts to develop wind, solar, and other clean energy jobs.

By contrast, the Democratic platform included a mere two skimpy paragraphs on workers and wages.

Some Democrats are troubled by this shift in priorities, away from New Deal-ish lunch-bucket concerns—because, as a matter of fact, it’s a shift away from the very idea of economic growth. For example, William Galston, a top White House domestic-policy aide to Bill Clinton in the 90s, had this to say about the Democrats’ latest platform:

The draft is truly remarkable—for example, its near-silence on economic growth. . . . Rather, the platform draft’s core narrative is inequality, the injustice that inequality entails, and the need to rectify it through redistribution.

A few days later, another Democrat, urban geographer Joel Kotkin, went even further:

Increasingly, liberals, or progressives, are at best ambivalent about economic growth, particularly in such blue-collar fields as fossil fuel energy, manufacturing, agribusiness and suburban homebuilding.

Perhaps it seems strange that a political party would lose interest in such an obvious political staple as economic growth. And yet if we look more closely, we can see, from the perspective of the new Democrats, that this economic neglect makes a kind of sense: We can note, for example, that the financial heart of the green movement is made up of billionaires; they have all the money they need—and, thanks to their donations, they have a disproportionate voice.

One of these noisy green fat cats is San Francisco’s Tom Steyer, who contributed $50 million to Democratic campaigns in 2014 and has been spending heavily ever since. We can further point out: If Steyer chooses to assign a higher value to his eco-conscience than to jobs for ordinary Americans, well, who in his rarified Bay Area social stratum is likely to argue with him?

Admittedly, billionaires are few in number—even in the Democratic Party. Yet at the same time, many other groups of Democratic voters aren’t necessarily concerned about the vagaries of the economy, because they, too, in their own way, are insulated from its ups and downs. That is, they get their check, no matter what.

The most obvious of these groups, of course, are government employees. Some of them, especially in the military and in law enforcement, might well be Republicans. Yet on the whole, public-sector workers have an obvious class-interest in voting Democratic, and they know it—lots of Lois Lerners in this group.

Then there are the recipients of government benefits. And here we can immediately stipulate that there’s a critical, perhaps even binary, distinction to be drawn—between those who have earned their benefits through work, and those who have not.

In the “earned” category are the beneficiaries of Security Security and other forms of work-related pensions, such as veterans benefits. For these folks, having spent decades in the workforce, the values of delayed gratification and thrift are likely ingrained in them, and this shapes their outlook in later life—whichever party they might identify with.

Meanwhile, in the “unearned” category are those who, for lack of a better word, get their money for free—their benefits, however desperately they might be needed, are unearned. And all available evidence tells us that this latter group has a much different mindset, and thus a much different political outlook. So as not to be coy about this point, we can just say it: welfare recipients, for example, are overwhelmingly Democratic. And Democratic politicians, of course, know this electoral calculus full well.

Indeed, in this era of slow economic growth, nearly 95 million Americans over the age of 16 are not in the labor force; not all of them are receiving a check from the government, but most are. And that has political consequences.

We can take this reality—economic stagnation on the one hand, economic dependence on the other—a step further: If the Democrats can find the votes they need from the plutocrats and the poor—or near-poor, plus public employees—then they can make a strategic choice: They can ignore the interests of working-class people in the private sector, and they can still win.

So for this cynical reason, the Democrats’ decision to stiff the working stiffs who might have worked on the Dakota pipeline was an easy one.

We can sum up the Democrats’ strategy more concisely: In socioeconomic terms, they will go above the working class, and also below the working class. That is, they will be the party of George Soros and Al Sharpton. So no room, anywhere, for the blue collars. (Of course, if any of those would-be pipeline workers end up on public assistance, well, they’ll have a standing offer to join the Democratic fold.)

We can see this Soros-Sharpton coalition in America’s electoral geography: The Democrats expect to sweep the upper east side of Manhattan, and, at the same time, they expect to sweep the south side of Chicago. Moreover, this high-low pattern appears everywhere: Greenwich and the ghetto, Beverly Hills and the barrio.  

In addition, Democrats can expect to do well in upper-middle class suburban enclaves, as well as college towns. And so if we add all those blocs together, plus the aforementioned public-employee unions, we can see that the Democrats have their coalition—quite possibly, it’s a 2016 victory coalition.

So now can see the logic of the logic of the Democrats’ policy choices.  And we can even add an interesting bit of backstory to the Democrats’ 2016 platform. In June, as a concession to the insurgency of Sen. Bernie Sanders, Hillary Clinton’s campaign agreed to include a contingent of Sanders supporters on the 15-member platform-drafting committee.

Specifically, the Clinton camp accepted the Palestinian-American activist James Zogby, the Muslim Congressman Keith Ellison of Minnesota, the environmental activist Bill McKibben, the African-American activist Cornel West, and the Native American activist Deborah Parker. And yet as the The Washington Post reported, the Clintonites, working through the Democratic National Committee, rejected another of Sanders’ proffered appointees, namely, Roseann DeMoro, executive director of National Nurses United.  As the Post explained,

The DNC informed the campaign it did not want an additional labor representative on the platform-writing committee, since one already sat on the full platform committee.

In other words, the unions got a grand total of one name on that 15-member body. Meanwhile, Democratic elected officials, plus various minorities, donors, and activists occupied the other 14 slots. So we can see: Big Labor isn’t so big anymore; it is now reduced to token status within the party.

Given this new correlation of forces, it’s no surprise that top Democrats oppose the Dakota pipeline. Just on Monday, Barack Obama—having blocked the Keystone Pipeline last year— indicated that he opposes, as well, the Dakota pipeline. Supportively donned in traditional Indian attire, the President praised the anti-pipeline elements of a Native American conclave for “making their voices heard.”

Indeed, the Dakota pipeline is probably already dead: Protestors, unhindered by federal law enforcement, have already effectively stopped its construction. And on September 16, a federal appeals court ruled against it.

Thus we can see that a familiar combination of forces, protestors and litigators, stopped the pipeline—even before Democratic politicians could move in to deliver the coup de grace.

Interestingly, one Democratic figure loudly opposed to the pipeline is the same Roseann DeMoro, the head of the nurses’ union, who was excluded from the DNC platform earlier this year.  Yet even so, she’s fully on board with the new order; as she told The Huffington Post,

The environmental movement and the labor movement need to join very strong forces . . . The [AFL-CIO] has to turn the corner in a throwdown on the right type of employment, the right type of jobs, and the right type of planet.  This is a zero-sum game.

We can pause over those stern last words: “This is a zero-sum game.” That is to say, in this new era of green-first politics, the anti-pipeline forces must win, and the pro-pipeliners must lose.

For his part, McGarvey, the building-trades union leader, issued an angry response. If union leaders choose to regard “climate change” as the “most pressing issue” he snapped, they can look to themselves first:

I suggest they work within their own industries to do their part to combat the problem and not callously and hypocritically take it out on hard working American AFL-CIO members.

Still, it seems a safe bet that McGarvey’s lament will not change any minds within the Democratic Party.

For her part, Hillary Clinton certainly knows where she stands: She’s with the new eco- and multicultural Democrats, not the old unionists—who were, after all, mostly “deplorable.” As she said to a cheering campaign crowd earlier this year, “We’re going to put a lot of coal miners and coal companies out of business.”

To be sure, Clinton has a heart—a taxpayer-funded heart. In fact, she has offered to put all those soon-to-be ex-coal workers on the government dole; she has proposed a $30 billion program for them.

Yet whether or not Congress ever approves that $30 billion, it’s a safe bet that if Clinton wins, more fossil-fuel workers will need to find some new way of earning a living. After all, just last year, the Obama administration pledged that the U.S. would reduce its greenhouse gas emissions by 26 to 28 percent by 2025. And whereas Donald Trump has promised to scrap those growth-flattening CO2 targets, Clinton has promised to maintain them.

Indeed, during Monday night’s debate in New York, she promised to install “half a billion more solar panels” as part of her plan, she said, to create 10 million new jobs.

We can quickly observe that most blue collars don’t seem to trust Clinton with their livelihoods; Trump beats her among non-college-educated men by a whopping 59 points.

Yet at the same time, we can add that if Trump leads among blue collars by “only” 59 points, that might not be enough for him to overcome Clinton’s advantage—her huge strength among the Soros-Sharpton coalition. And here we can note, with some perplexity, that the leadership of the industrial unions is still mostly in lockstep with the Democrats. That residual partisan loyalty to the party of FDR might cost their members their jobs now that the Democrats have found policy goals other than mass employment, but hey, perhaps the union bosses themselves can get jobs at Hillary’s Department of Labor.

So if Clinton wins this November, what will happen to the private-sector blue collars, especially those in the traditional energy sector?

Sadly, we already know the answer to that question; the only unresolved matter is how they might react. In the meantime, even as the election outcome is in doubt, we might venture this grimly tongue-in-cheek suggestion if Clinton wins: If gainful employment is no longer an option, perhaps these newly unemployed workers could start a protest movement—they could call it “Blue Collar Lives Matter.”

Such protesting wouldn’t get them back their jobs, of course, but at least they could get a government grant."
100137,1003,"If Trump Won’t Admit To Losing The Debate, Will He Admit To Losing An Election?",http://www.huffingtonpost.com/ari-rabin-havt/if-trump-wont-admit-to-lo_b_12236848.html?utm_hp_ref=politics,6,"American democracy is ultimately predicated on a certain level of comity between political factions, particularly during transitions of power. Leaders of both parties might snipe and engage in pitched battles yet are able to hand over power in a relatively smooth fashion. For more than a century, the Democratic and Republican Parties have accepted electoral defeat and marshaled themselves to fight again in two or four years.
 
Donald Trump’s behavior following his clear defeat in Monday night’s debate with Hillary Clinton calls into question whether or not he will be willing to accept November 8’s results.
 
This was clearly on debate moderator and NBC anchor Lester Holt’s mind when he asked both candidates if they will be “willing to accept the outcome [of the election] as the will of the voters?”
 
Clinton immediately answered she will “support the outcome of this election.”
 
After Trump offered a rambling response that had nothing to do with the question asked, Holt was forced to follow up with him a second time. Trump finally stated that “I don’t believe Hillary will. The answer is, if she wins, I will absolutely support her.”
 
This pledge is as worthless as a degree from Trump University. After all, before he won the Republican primary, Trump confessed that he had no plans to abide by his signed pledge to support whomever won the GOP nomination.  
 
Trump’s behavior in the 48 hours since he resoundingly lost the presidential debate at Hofstra University not only demonstrated his penchant for denying reality, it also foreshadowed a dangerous post-election playbook for his campaign.
 
Trump turned to self-selecting online exercises—to call them surveys or polls connotes an air of legitimacy and scientific validity they do not deserve—touting his mythical victory, even though they measure nothing other than the whim of website visitors to click a button, sometimes over and over again. He also thanked Fox for promoting the results of these online games. Trump even cited polls that did not exist.
 
The GOP nominee then turned his ire on Holt. While conceding that the debate moderator “was okay” and “didn’t do a bad job,” Trump told “Fox & Friends“ that “he gave me very unfair questions at the end, the last three, four questions.” Among those unfair questions was: “Are you willing to accept the outcome as the will of the voters?” Trump also complained about “some hostile questions” from Holt.
 
This was after claiming he was given “a defective mic,” perhaps “on purpose.”
 
This could all be cast aside as the normal political wrangling that comes as part of every election cycle. Except there was never a need to ask whether Mitt Romney or John McCain would refuse to accept the validity of electoral results.
 
After McCain and Romney lost their respective contests with President Obama, the fringes of the Right ginned up hysterical lies about ACORN stealing the election, race baited about the New Black Panther party and concocted dozens of other conspiracy theories. Regardless, the will of the voters was allowed to be carried out.
 
Trump’s delusional inability to accept a loss, once again demonstrated by his behavior following Monday night’s debate, could spark a constitutional crisis.
 
If he does refuse to accept the election of Hillary Clinton, what would that look like? There are plenty of points after November 8 at which he could attempt to poke a stick into the spokes of the wheel of democracy. Trump could demand that states not certify the results of the election or he could attempt to convince members of Congress to reject electors.
 
Following the 2008 election, 52 percent of Republicans believed ACORN stole the election for Obama. Forty-nine percent of Republicans believed this following the 2012 election even though the organization had been disbanded more than two years earlier. Suffice it to say that at least a sizeable chunk of the GOP’s base would likely follow Trump off this dangerous cliff. Would Republican members of Congress or their leadership fear their wrath in primaries and therefore go along with those trying to cast an election into doubt?
 
Furthermore, would the media give an air of legitimacy to an undemocratic attempt to subvert the will of voters? What about media figures still on the payroll of the Trump campaign? Or those who have participated in their ads? Or what about media outlets run by the campaign’s chairman?
 
Holt was right to insist that Trump answer whether or not he would accept the outcome of the election. The question, as always, is whether he’ll keep his word."
100138,1003,First Presidential Debate: A Loud and Clear Bully-Baby Phenominon,http://www.huffingtonpost.com/sarakay-smullens/first-presidential-debate_3_b_12237710.html?utm_hp_ref=politics,6,"Here is a truth you can bet on: When bullies fail to get their way, they become whining, belligerent babies, their insistence in pitching to hatred toward others unwavering. This was precisely demonstrated at the first presidential debate. Hillary Clinton and NBC News anchor, Lester Holt, gave Donald Trump all of the room he needed to expose his true nature, and he took the bait. I could not believe my ears when I heard Trump’s grandiose interjections as Secretary Clinton pondered the possibility that he would not reveal his federal returns because he did not pay federal taxes: “That makes me smart” and “It would be squandered, too, believe me” are exact quotes.

Immediately following the debate, one where the Democratic candidate clearly came across as prepared, knowledgeable, calm, and assuredly presidential, what did Donald Trump do? He entered the Spin Room, where candidates at this stage in the election never go — his family entourage, the whole enmeshed gang of them, following. There he got really ugly, warning that due to his fondness of Chelsea (a close friend of his daughter) he had contained an assault on the personal lives of the Clintons, i.e. their marriage, which may well be forthcoming.

The following day, in predictable “bully to baby form,” he whined and complained, sputtering on, taking no responsibility for his lack of preparation and poor showing. The fault, he insisted, was the possibility of someone tinkering with the microphone and, in shades of his Megyn Kelly attack, the unfair questions of moderator Holt. Again, he raised speculation about Secretary Clinton’s stamina, a clear endorsement of the right wing on-line insistence that she has an undisclosed neurological illness. Plus, he warned that President Clinton’s marital indiscretions were on the table for consideration in the next debate.

Sadly, the Republican Party has been bringing humiliation on itself for years, and Donald Trump is their culmination. Members have stood far too quietly by as the Tea Party has highjacked their dignity. I was not alone in hoping that when John McCain, whom I saw as statesman and hero, opposed Barack Obama in 2008 there would be high level issue concentration pointing to the differences in philosophy of each party, an approach which would have enlightened voters about the convictions and strengths of each orientation. Sadly, the opportunity was missed. Instead, McCain drowned common sense and decorum, selecting ditzy candidate Sarah Palin to become his vice-presidential candidate.

The last time someone like Donald Trump dominated our political scene, staining the honor and conscience of our country to this degree, here and abroad, was the reign of terror brought by Wisconsin Senator Joe McCarthy in the 1950s. During McCarthy’s post World War II domination lives were destroyed when the senator branded them Communists. The tipping point ending this madness came in June, 1954 during hearings on whether communism had infiltrated U.S. armed forces. At this time Joseph Welch, Special Counsel for the U.S. army, brought a long overdue public awakening by asked the senator, “Have you no sense of decency, sir, at long last? Have you no sense of decency?”http://www.americanrhetoric.com/speeches/welch-mccarthy.html

When I think of those who thrive on the domination of others through intimidation, insult and fear — in families, in communities, in job settings, and on a national scene, and the intense hold they are able to achieve, I am reminded of the parable that speaks of the competing forces that exist in each of us: A Cherokee chief took his young son aside to teach him about leadership, preparing him for the time son would replace father. The boy was intrigued as his father told him that a dangerous fight was going on inside of him between two wolves: One wolf was evil - dominated by anger, selfishness, envy, greed, and a sense of inferiority, which led him to look down on and demean others. The other wolf was good - concentrating on clear thinking, love, hope, benevolence, generosity, empathy, and joy. He further explained that this fight was going on in every person his son would ever meet. Captivated, the boy asked his father which wolf would win. His response: “The one you feed.”"
100139,1003,Assessing Donald Trump’s Debate Implosion,http://www.huffingtonpost.com/andy-ostroy/assessing-donald-trumps-d_b_12214006.html?utm_hp_ref=politics,6,"It was a beautiful thing to watch. There’s nothing sweeter than witnessing a Donald Trump implosion in front of 100-million people. I suspect the first presidential debate will likely go down as the modern-day Kennedy-Nixon contest for its ultimate impact on the election.

The debate could be summed up against a singular backdrop: the candidates each had one critical mission to accomplish. Trump needed to demonstrate a temperament that’s presidential. Clinton needed to be likeable. That’s it. Because when it comes to substance and policy, there’s no contest. So what happened?

Trump showed up as he always does: cocky, brash and, unfortunately for him, winging it. And to borrow from Trump and his surrogates, she came “over-prepared.” By the end of the night Trump appeared scared, ensnared and woefully unprepared...while Clinton was composed, disciplined, engaging, endearing and affable (as an aside, I don’t think Team-Trump will be accusing her of “not smiling enough” anymore). And while she took the high road, he snaked along the curb.

The big question leading up to Monday’s debate was “which Trump will show up?” Would it be boring Trump? Toned-down Trump? Old Trump? New Trump? But it was much simpler than that. Just Trump showed up. The one and only Trump. The same smug, belittling, thin-skinned egomaniacal Trump the world has known since his rich pappy gave him that “small” $1-million loan and put him on the New York real estate map.

The Trump we saw was the familiar bloviating empty-suited bully. He was loud, angry, belligerent, combative, nasty, demeaning, dismissive, disrespectful and dishonest. He sighed, sniffled repeatedly, nervously guzzled water, made juvenile mocking faces, interrupted Clinton 30 times and was disrespectful to the moderator Lester Holt. It was not pretty. Like Nixon’s performanace in 1960 against the calm, cool, polished, telegenic John F. Kennedy, it was awkward and unattractive. The only thing missing was Nixon’s sweaty 5 o’clock shadow and dark-circled darting eyes.

I’m not going to get into the weeds of Trump’s pathology except to say that his lying, narcissism, sexism and racism took center stage. He was consistently offensive when the subjects were the birther movement, black communities, Clinton’s appearance and health, women and his “deserved” attacks on Rosie O’donnell. He justified his racial discrimination charges from the 1970’s by saying other real estate developers had also been sued by the Justice Department. In Trump’s convoluted world, every despicable act is justified if someone else has also done it...or done it first.

Yes, Just Trump showed up alright, and voters got a solid glimpse of the man who insisted he has the right temperament to be president even as he made that claim while seeming totally unhinged.

Trump appeared to admit that he pays zero federal income taxes (“Because I’m smart”) . He seemed to admit that he could release his tax returns at any time (said he’d do it, despite his lawyers’ counsel, if Clinton releases “the 33,000 emails.”).

One of the most bizarre moments came during the subject of cyber attacks and hacking, and whether the United States government is being targeted by Russia. He defended Russia, his praise of Vladimir Putin, and his challenge for the former Soviet Union to “find the missing emails,” claiming that it could be anyone doing the hacking, including China or “someone sitting on their bed that weighs 400 pounds.” Give him credit. Just when you think he can’t offend any other voter group he goes ahead and loses the overweight block.

But the knockout punch of the debate came when Trump suggested Clinton was ‘over-prepared.’

“I think Donald just criticized me for preparing for this debate. And, yes, I did. You know what else I prepared for? I prepared to be president. And I think that’s a good thing.”

The argument can be made that Trump’s decision to forego the typical debate prep in and of itself is a unequivocal disqualifier. That if he doesn’t think the job requires an investment in time and preparedness, then he’s not fit for office. To be sure, for ninety minutes Monday night Trump drove that point home masterfully.

It’s the temperament, stupid..."
100140,1004,Trump Advisers Reportedly Wringing Hands Over His Debate Performance,http://talkingpointsmemo.com/livewire/new-york-times-advisers-lament-trump-debate-performance,6,"While Donald Trump’s advisers have publicly praised his performance in the first presidential debate, The New York Times reported Wednesday that they have privately lamented the real estate mogul’s missed opportunities to attack Hillary Clinton and palpable loss of steam as the 90-minute event wore on.

Seven campaign aides and advisors who spoke to the Times on condition of anonymity attributed the subpar performance to Trump’s lack of focus in prep meetings, unwillingness to practice using a podium or doing mock debates, and reliance on advisers like retired Army general Michael Flynn, who has no experience with presidential debates. While Trump has touted his victory in a spate of unscientific online polls, both conservative and liberal political analysts have said Trump’s lack of preparation was readily apparent during Monday’s face-off, allowing Clinton to steer the conversation and get under his skin. Despite engaging in an extended back-and-forth with moderator Lester Holt in which he falsely insisted he never supported the Iraq War, randomly insulting comedian Rosie O’Donnell, and bragging about the fact that he didn’t pay taxes, Trump left the debate confident, telling reporters the questions were “very fair.”

By the next morning, Trump was lashing out at the “unfair” questions posed by Holt and biased media coverage of the debate, introducing complaints about a faulty microphone to help explain his performance.

Trump said he may “hit her harder” in the next debate on Oct. 9 in St. Louis, Missouri, which will be a town hall format where undecided voters will be allowed to ask the candidates questions.

According to the Times, advisers want Trump to practice debating in this format, address the nuances of going head-to-head with a female candidate, and hone his attacks on Clinton’s vulnerabilities. They reportedly remain concerned that he will follow through."
100141,1004,Arizona Republic Endorses Dem For First Time: Trump A ‘Recipe’ For ‘Civil Discord’,http://talkingpointsmemo.com/livewire/arizona-republic-endorses-hillary-clinton-first-ever-demorat,6,"The deeply conservative Arizona Republic endorsed the Democratic nominee for president for the first time in its 126-year history on Tuesday, labeling Donald Trump a “reckless,” “divisive” candidate who is wrong on immigration and ignorant on foreign policy.

“In a nation with an increasingly diverse population, Trump offers a recipe for permanent civil discord,” the editorial board wrote. “In a global economy, he offers protectionism and a false promise to bring back jobs that no longer exist.”

“America needs to look ahead and build a new era of prosperity for the working class,” they added. ""This is Hillary Clinton's opportunity.""

Trump has used the Grand Canyon state as the backdrop for a number of major rallies, including the fiery August immigration speech in Phoenix in which he called for mass deportation and insisted Mexico would build a new wall on the United States’ border just hours after holding a subdued joint press conference with the Mexican president.

The Republic’s editorial board noted that Arizona has already gone down “the hardline immigration road Trump travels,” with disastrous results.

“It led our state to SB 1070, the 2010 'show me your papers' law that earned Arizona international condemnation and did nothing to resolve real problems with undocumented immigration,” the editorial states. “Arizona understands that we don’t need a repeat of that divisive, unproductive fiasco on the national level.”

The lengthy editorial praises Clinton’s record on gender equality, human rights, national security, and foreign policy, while casting Trump as a candidate with “deep character flaws,” a “stunning lack of human decency,” and a “reckless” habit of making off-the-cuff remarks that could threaten US security.

The former secretary of state is polling closely behind the real estate mogul in Arizona, earning 38.4 percent compared to 43.1 percent for Trump according to TPM’s PollTracker Average. A number of traditionally conservative newspapers across the country have come out in support of Clinton in recent weeks, including The Dallas Morning News and Cincinnati Enquirer. The New Hampshire Union Leader declined to endorse either major-party candidate, instead backing Libertarian candidate Gary Johnson in a pointed affront to Trump."
100142,1004,Popular Alt-Right Meme Deemed Hate Symbol By Anti-Defamation League,http://talkingpointsmemo.com/livewire/pepe-anti-defamation-league-hate-symbol,6,"Where the alt-right sees a patron saint, a civil rights organization sees a symbol of hate.

The Anti-Defamation League on Tuesday added Pepe the Frog, the comic-character-turned-meme-turned-alt-right-mascot often invoked by the Donald Trump campaign, to its list of hate symbols.

Pepe, which the nonprofit group notes did not originally have anti-Semitic and racist connotations, has become a popular meme and identifying symbol of the far-right movement on the fringes of the internet. Pepe is now often depicted wearing Nazi garb or Ku Klux Klan robes and drawn in comics that make references to the Holocaust.

The ADL notes these images have been used to harass minorities online.

“Once again, racists and haters have taken a popular Internet meme and twisted it for their own purposes of spreading bigotry and harassing users,” Jonathan A. Greenblatt, the group's CEO, said in a statement. “These anti-Semites have no shame. They are abusing the image of a cartoon character, one that might at first seem appealing, to harass and spread hatred on social media.”

If the symbol looks familiar, it may be because Pepe is frequently used online in relation to the Trump campaign. Users have drawn him with sporting Trump's infamous hairdo, a meme he tweeted out earlier this year. Pepe also made an appearance on a meme made following Hillary Clinton's ""basket of deplorables"" comments, putting him alongside Trump's children and symbols of conservative media: The group has added Pepe to its ""Hate on Display"" database, archiving symbols used to harass and spread hate online. Other symbols recently added include the (((echo))), used by far-right Twitter users to point out other Jewish users for harassment. "
100143,1005,Watch Donald Trump Say He Hired a Female Employee Just Because She Was Hot,http://www.motherjones.com/politics/2016/09/watch-donald-trump-hire-woman-hot,6,"While campaigning for president, Donald Trump often boasts that he hires the ""best people."" But in 2007, he bragged that he hired a woman with no experience because she was hot.

His comments came in a speech for the Learning Annex, an adult education firm that reportedly paid Trump $1.5 million per appearance. During the question-and-answer portion of the event, held in San Francisco, a woman in the audience asked Trump, ""How many jets do you have and how might I apply to be a flight attendant?"" Trump immediately had the woman brought onstage, where he checked her out, wrapped his arm around her, and and then declared, ""You're hired.""

Then Trump launched into an anecdote about a time he hired a woman based solely on her looks. ""A beautiful girl who was 17 or 18 and applied to be a waitress,"" Trump said. ""So beautiful. She's like a world-class beauty."" But, Trump recalled, his advisers pointed out that the woman had no experience. ""So I interviewed her anyway because she was so pretty,"" he continued. ""And I said, 'Let me ask you: Do you have any experience?' She goes, 'No, sir.' I say, 'When can you start?'"" Trump flashed a big smile at the crowd. Trump returned to the woman onstage with him. ""You can work on my plane anytime,"" he said.

Trump told the large audience that beautiful women are his ""alcoholism."" And he noted, ""If she worked on my plane, that's like a death wish for me.""

Throughout the campaign, Trump has been dogged by his statements about women. He has often spoken about them in oafish and misogynistic ways. During the primary campaign, he insulted the appearance of his primary opponent Carly Fiorina. And, in comments that have been widely interpreted as sexist, he has claimed that Hillary Clinton does not have ""a presidential look."" At the first presidential debate on Monday night, Clinton went after Trump on this front and pointed out that he had called women ""pigs"" and ""dogs"" and that he had insulted and body-shamed a former Miss Universe in the 1990s.

Trump tried to defend himself by noting that he has said some ""very tough things"" about Rosie O'Donnell and that ""nobody feels sorry for her."" The next day, he said the former Miss Universe, Alicia Machado, was ""the absolute worst"" and that her weight was ""a real problem.""

Here's a transcript of Trump's 2007 exchange during the Learning Annex speech:

Woman in the audience: My name is Juliet. I have a question. My question is, how many jets do you have and how might I apply to be a flight attendant?

Trump: Come on up here and [unintelligible]. I think she's hired. [The woman joins him onstage, and Trump wraps his arms around her.] You're hired.

Trump: You know, I had a case that was very interesting. A beautiful girl who was 17 or 18 and applied to be a waitress. So beautiful. She's like a world-class beauty—like the young lady who just asked a question about the actress. She's so beautiful. And my people came and she said, ""Mr. Trump, she has no experience."" So I interviewed her anyway because she was so pretty. And I said, ""Let me ask you, do you have any experience?"" She goes, ""No, sir."" I say, ""When can you start?"" [Trump kisses the woman before she leaves the podium.]

Trump: You can work on my plane anytime. [Trump stares at the woman as she walks off the stage.]

Trump: See now, if she worked on my plane, that's like a death wish for me, right? That's like an alcoholic [unintelligible]. People are alcoholics. You put Scotch in front of them, it's like [Trump gestures wildly with his hands], it's like, this would be my form of alcoholism."
100144,1005,Trump's Huge Conflict of Interest With a Big Foreign Bank Keeps Getting Worse,http://www.motherjones.com/politics/2016/09/trumps-conflict-interest-big-overseas-bank-getting-worse-minute,6,"Deutsche Bank is in deep trouble. Its stock price has plummeted in recent days after the Justice Department demanded the gigantic German bank pay $14 billion to settle claims regarding its sale of bad mortgage-backed securities in the the run-up to the 2008 financial crisis. The bank's shares fell to a new low on Tuesday over reports it might be seeking a bailout from the German government—which Deutsche Bank has denied. The crisis has exposed the fragile state of one of the world's largest banks, but it also highlights a potential massive conflict of interest for Donald Trump.

In the past few years, Trump obtained $364 million in loans from Deutsche bank via four mortgages on three of his prized properties: Miami's Doral National golf course, Chicago's Trump International Hotel and Tower, and the newly opened Trump International Hotel in Washington, DC, a few blocks from the White House. A foreign entity holding so much of Trump's debt—financial leverage that could affect the decision-making of a future commander in chief—has raised alarms among ethics watchdogs. But with Deutsche Bank floundering, the possible conflicts posed by Trump's loans are compounding.

The financial health of Deutsche Bank is important for Trump's corporate empire. Because of Trump's history of failed projects and repeated bankruptcies, many of the world's top banks have long stopped doing business with him. Deutsche Bank was one of the only major banks—perhaps the only—that would work with him, and their relationship has been rocky. Trump wore out his welcome with Deutsche Bank's corporate banking arm in 2008, when he attempted to get out of paying $40 million he personally owed the bank after his company failed to make a payment deadline on a larger $640 million loan for his Chicago project. But Trump has maintained his relationship with Deutsche's so-called ""private bank""—an arm of the bank that caters to wealthy people and has more flexibility in its lending standards than the corporate side. The four loans Trump currently has with Deutsche Bank are each from the private bank, a Deutsche Bank official told Mother Jones.

Deutsche Bank has vowed to fight the US government over the hefty fine it is threatening to impose. The bank has said it is prepared to pay no more than $2 billion or $3 billion and noted in a statement last week that it has ""no intent to settle these potential civil claims anywhere near the number cited."" Settlement negotiations are expected to take months, raising the possibility that Trump might be in the White House when a final decision is made. In an unprecedented face-off between a foreign bank and an administration led by a man deeply in debt to that bank, how would Trump balance the public interest with his private interests? Could American taxpayers be assured that a Trump administration would aggressively seek the maximum penalty against a lender that played a role in tanking the economy in 2008? Or would Deutsche Bank receive special consideration or favorable terms because of its ties to—or leverage over—Trump?

The news media has paid attention to the debt Trump, via partnerships, owes a Chinese bank. But Trump's relationship with Deutsche Bank has yet to receive much scrutiny. And if Deutsche Bank continues to falter, there is the possibility that it may need to sell off loans, perhaps including the Trump loans. It's hard to imagine a more staggering conflict of interest than a potential or sitting president's debts being placed on the global market. What individuals or financial institutions here or abroad might buy them? Meanwhile, Trump has offered no firm explanation for how he would separate himself from his businesses—or his debts—if elected president."
100145,1005,Chelsea Clinton Slams Donald Trump After He Threatens to Discuss Her Father's Infidelity,http://www.motherjones.com/politics/2016/09/chelsea-clinton-fires-back-donald-trump-affairs,6,"Chelsea Clinton is firing back at Donald Trump's suggestion that he showed restraint in not broaching the subject of her father's extramarital affairs during the first presidential debate. 

""Well, my reaction to that is just what my reaction has been kind of every time Trump has gone after my mom or my family, which is that it's a distraction from his inability to talk about what's actually at stake in this election,"" the former first daughter told Cosmopolitan. She continued by listing policy areas, such as national security and rising college tuition costs, as examples of topics Trump is unable to coherently discuss, much less debate.

After Monday's debate, Trump intimated that his decision not to bring up Bill Clinton's history of infidelities at the debate was a result of his generous character and respect for the Clinton family, especially Chelsea.

""I was going to say something extremely rough to Hillary, her family, and I said to myself, 'I can't do it. I just can't do it,'"" he said. ""It's inappropriate, it's not nice."" Trump later confirmed that he was indeed referring to the former president's well-publicized affairs. When Clinton sat down with Cosmopolitan, she appeared unfazed by Trump's thinly veiled reference.

""Candidly, I don't remember a time in my life when my parents and my family weren't being attacked,"" she said. ""So it just sort of seems to be in that tradition, unfortunately.""

On Tuesday, Eric Trump, the real estate magnate's son from his first marriage to Ivana, said it had taken ""courage"" for his father not to bring up the affairs. He commended the moment, saying it was something he'd ""always remember."""
100146,1006,Trey Gowdy to Comey: What more would Hillary Clinton have had to do to get you to prosecute her?,http://hotair.com/archives/2016/09/28/trey-gowdy-comey-hillary-clinton-get-prosecute/,6,"The whole thing’s worth watching but especially the bit beginning at 3:30. This is a sequel to Gowdy’s first grilling of Comey before the House Oversight Committee in July, so go watch that clip to prepare yourself for this one. Gowdy’s point then was simple: 18 U.S.C. 793(f), the statute that makes mishandling classified information a felony, applies if the suspect showed “gross negligence” in how they handled the info. You don’t need to show that they intended to mishandle it in order to get a conviction. (Who besides an actual spy would intentionally mishandle state secrets?) All you need to prove is that they were grossly deficient in their duty to handle the information responsibly. Which, very clearly, was true in the case of Hillary “Private Server” Clinton. Comey, however, declined to charge her because, he said, only once in the many decades since that law was passed has someone been charged under it. Supposedly it would be unfair to prosecute Hillary for showing gross negligence when other people hadn’t been prosecuted — never mind that, as a cabinet official, her recklessness involved information at the highest levels of secrecy. Comey all but declared at his press conference in July that he would have prosecuted Clinton only if he had detected an intent to mishandle info. Gross negligence wasn’t enough to charge — even though that’s all the statute requires.

Gowdy’s point is the same now as it was then. Isn’t destroying evidence and then lying about it the best evidence of criminal intent insofar as it reveals a guilty mind? Because that’s what we have here — deleted emails, wiped servers, and then a series of public lies by Hillary about whether she’d ever dealt with classified information on her private system. What more would you need to have seen from her by way of suspicious behavior, he asks Comey, to conclude that she really did know all along that she was mishandling classified information and therefore is guilty even under Comey’s own standard of intent? Comey … has no good answer. Yes, he says, it’s true that concealing evidence is a strong indicator of bad intent, but we need to look at what the suspect has said, too. Which is Gowdy’s point: The false exculpatory statements Clinton has made publicly are further proof that she’s concealing the truth. We also need to look at whether anyone’s been prosecuted for this particular crime before, notes Comey. That’s all that seems left of his decision not to charge her now. He’s not forcefully disputing Gowdy’s claim that Hillary knowingly, not just negligently, mishandled classified information. All he’s saying when you boil it down is that if no one’s gone to prison for this before, it’d be unfair to send Clinton to prison for it now. In July it seemed as though he was writing a new element of the crime into the statute, replacing “gross negligence” with “intent.” Now it seems like he’s writing the statute out of existence entirely because it hasn’t been used in court enough to this point.

Emphasis on “seems”: If you’re a government employee, I advise you not to test the FBI’s willingness to charge you if you’re an average nobody rather than their potential next boss."
100147,1006,Hillary to working-class voters: I worked hard for my money,http://hotair.com/archives/2016/09/28/hillary-working-class-voters-worked-hard-money/,6,"Hillary Clinton’s campaign prepared for the first presidential debate not just tactically but also strategically. Hillary offered up at least two attacks on Trump that launched new campaign themes, the first of which attempts to paint Donald Trump as a misogynist by raising Alicia Machado as a surrogate. That effort might not pan out as well as Team Hillary hoped, as they seem to have done a remarkably amateurish job of vetting their new spokesperson.

That might not be the worst of the two strategies, however. Politico’s Annie Karni reports that Hillary has turned an attack on Trump’s inheritance into a claim that the Clintons got wealthy from the sweat of their brow, or something:

But on the debate stage Monday and on the campaign trail in North Carolina on Tuesday, Clinton made a strategic shift to show her privilege as different from his: The Clintons came from nothing and lived the American dream; Trump, she said, was just born that way.

“Bill and I have been blessed,” Clinton said at a community college gymnasium here in Raleigh, speaking to a crowd of about 1,400 supporters, where she touted her plans for paid family leave and debt-free college. “We didn’t come from millionaire families. My husband’s father died before he was born.” …

Contrasting the candidates’ upbringings is critical for Clinton, in part because Trump’s message is resonating with working-class voters in battleground states such as Ohio and Pennsylvania. “You can’t negate that by simply saying it’s bad policy,” Begala added, “but you can say also it’s coming from a guy who is an untrustworthy messenger.”

Clinton’s close ties to Wall Street, her love of a six-figure paid speech and a big donor confab, are parts of her that even admirers can be put off by — and Bernie Sanders’ baggy-suited, man-of-the-people persona was a big part of his progressive appeal. Clinton often talks about her decision to go work for the Children’s Defense Fund straight out of law school rather than join a fancy, white-shoe law firm — but skeptics arch an eyebrow at the fact that she has to reach back four decades into her life to produce that noble moment.
It’s true that Trump’s father was wealthy, and that Hillary Clinton hails from a solid middle-class background. However, Trump made his money in the private sector and built that inheritance into a much larger fortune, even if it’s still a matter of opinion just how large it actually is. Trump built skyscrapers and carried payrolls, employing tens of thousands of people, a point which even those critical of Trump’s business practices would have to concede. (Those business practices are certainly fair game for debate, considering Trump’s reliance on his business acumen for credibility in the presidential race.)

In contrast, Bill and Hillary Clinton have spent decades in the public sector — at the state level since the late 1970s, and at the federal level ever since. One or the other held high federal office from 1993 to 2013, a remarkable 20-year run — and that’s the same period when they made their wealth. Both benefited from astronomical book advances, but their real money came while Hillary served as Secretary of State.

Their tax returns show that the couple earned $57.5 million in the four years she ran the State Department (2009-12), thanks in large part to Bill’s speaking career at events tied to entities with business before the State Department. For instance, Bill got an $18 million contract over a five-year period as an “honorary chancellor” at Laureate International Universities, which means that his position wasn’t exactly a high-pressure job. That started in 2010, after Laureate’s CEO started getting invited to State Department dinners — a useful bit of access for someone running for-profit schools in foreign countries.

The Clintons didn’t work hard for their wealth, even if their parents might have struggled to get by. They got their cash from trading on their connections to power, abusing their public trusts, and corrupting government. Do working-class people have that path to wealth?"
100148,1006,Hillary Clinton is scrambling to snuff out third party candidates,http://hotair.com/archives/2016/09/28/hillary-clinton-scrambling-snuff-third-party-candidates/,6,"While things may change later this week as a result of the debate, the most recent polls have held no joy for Hillary Clinton. Donald Trump has gained on her nationally, either pulling ahead or landing in a dead heat. In the swing states the news was even worse. If you need proof of the fact that Team Clinton has noticed this, look no further than their efforts to stop bleeding off votes to third party candidates. The Hill reports today that the Clinton campaign has seen some of her support going to Libertarian Party candidate Gary Johnson and they’re trying to rope those wandering sheep back into the corral.

Liberal groups are passing around embarrassing videos of Johnson and running ads against him warning about his positions on issues like climate change that are important to young voters and independents.

The Clinton campaign will rely heavily on Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) in the coming weeks as it seeks to shore up its deficit among young voters and left-leaning independents who are not energized by her campaign and are considering casting a vote for either Johnson or Green Party nominee Jill Stein.

The Libertarian ticket of Johnson and Bill Weld is running surprisingly strong among young voters — a cog in the Obama coalition that Democrats need to turn out for Clinton if she’s to pull away from Trump.
If groups supporting Clinton are at the point where they are actually dumping significant cash into developing and running attack ads on Johnson you know that the mood in her HQ is serious. By this point in any campaign you’d expect the two major party candidates to have shrugged off third party challengers and be focusing their fire on each other. But if the 2016 election is going to come down to a game of inches, Clinton doesn’t have that option. Trump’s support, while far from a majority, has been stubbornly strong and resistant to any perceived bad news in the press. With that in mind, Clinton needs to find more voters, and Johnson is currently collecting nearly ten percent nationally with particular strength among millennials.

But it’s not just Johnson drawing the attention of the Clinton machine. Green Party candidate Jill Stein is very far down in the polls, but the roughly 3% she’s drawing is coming pretty much exclusively from liberal voters who would otherwise likely go to the Democrats. There have been signs in the past couple of weeks that the word went out to the Clinton faithful about knocking Stein out of this race. I first noticed it when Washington Post editorial board member Jonathan Capehart began sending out a series of tweets highlighting a very negative column on Stein. Now, seeing Capehart tweeting out links to his own columns is nothing new. He’s quite effective in promoting his work on social media. And I don’t shy away from saying he’s working to elect Hillary Clinton because he admits as much himself on a nearly daily basis, reminding his Twitter critics that he’s an opinion writer, not a reporter. But if you follow the link from the tweet above you’ll notice something a bit more remarkable. That column is from August.

When editorial page editor Fred Hiatt asked Stein about the NATO alliance and whether she shared Baraka’s opinion about “gangster states” of NATO,” she said, “ “Well he uses language I would not use. But, shall we say, I don’t think it represents American democracy to do an end run around our process or determining when we will go to war.”

“Well he uses language,” Hiatt pressed, “but what does he mean? Do you agree?” To which Stein replied, “I think he means the same thing I’m saying.
That scathing article was written to frame Stein as a closet racist… the go-to card to play when trying to summon up the liberal voting army. Given the negligible impact Stein has had on the race and the fact that she’s made a complete joke of herself through her various run-ins with the law, one might imagine that a single column on Stein’s perceived shortcomings in August would be a job well done and simply leave it at that. But the fact that it’s being trotted out yet again at the end of September shows that Clinton and her water carriers want to exterminate as much of the Stein vote as possible and bring that three percent back home.

That’s a common sense plan when you stop and think about it, but it has one potentially fatal flaw. Getting people to leave a candidate also depends on offering them something to come home to, and Hillary Clinton isn’t exactly a tempting offer these days. "

Though, 14% more Democrats were polled than Republicans.

Clearly NBC wants us to think they’re a bigger joke than we already do.

Now, a CNN/ORC poll shows Hillary trounced Trump in the first presidential debate, but they too fudged the numbers.

That poll was comprised of 41% Democrats to 26% Republicans.

How silly. From Info Wars:

A CNN/ORC poll released shortly after last night’s debate found that Hillary Clinton scored a clear victory over her rival Donald Trump. One problem – the survey sample included 41% Democrats compared to just 26% Republicans. Asked, “Who do you think did the best job in the debate – Hillary Clinton or Donald Trump?”, 62% of respondents said Hillary while 27% said Trump.

This immediately gave the impression that Hillary trounced Trump in the debate, and set the standard for the media narrative that it was a bad night for the Republican candidate. However, 33% of the people surveyed in the poll identified as Independents, 41% identified as Democrats, while just 26% identified as Republicans. Why do something like this and then claim the media is biased for Hillary?

Journalism is long dead.

Might as well be state-run at this point."

Meanwhile, Donald Trump held a jam-packed event in Florida with 15,000 in attendance.

In fact, 12,000 people had to be turned away.

Think about that.

Oh, one more thing.

The folks Trump had to send packing were the same total as all of grandma’s rallies since August 1. Since August 1st when both parties’ conventions concluded, Trump has had more than 312,000 people at his events with thousands turned away due to space limitations. He has set records for some of these locations in attendance. However, Hillary has only had 12,000 total at her rallies since August 1st. To put this in perspective, Trump has had 300,000 more people at his rallies than Hillary and over 26 times the crowds she has entertained and Trump turned away 12,000 people Tuesday night which is roughly the same amount of people that Hillary has entertained at all her rallies since August 1st! It’s getting harder and harder to believe that Donald Trump won’t become the next president.

The polls showing Clinton close in the race have to be off, considering the size of rallies alone.

Typical Democrat move.

Drop them the day before the weekend and by Monday nobody will care anymore.

Something interesting that was found involves a ‘confidential’ Hillary aide named Monica Hanley.

Hanley was twice interviewed by the FBI this year, indicating she played a major part in the scandal itself.

Her role was to manage some of Clinton’s mobile devices. She attempted to buy non-secure BlackBerries on Ebay, and even tried to acquire some on sale at a mall. From Fox News:

When Romanian hacker “Guccifer” breached Hillary Clinton confidant Sidney Blumenthal’s email account in 2013, it set off an explosive chain of events among a tight circle of Clinton family aides – including one “confidential assistant” whose extensive role in managing some of the former secretary’s mobile devices and computer security requests is only now becoming clear. The details were contained in the latest document dump of FBI files on Clinton’s personal email use. The FBI chose late Friday afternoon to release nearly 200 highly redacted pages of so-called “302” files from the bureau’s investigation, a release that quickly became overshadowed by the impending presidential debate Monday.

But the files included new details of the tech intervention by Clinton aide Huma Abedin and Clinton Foundation official Justin Cooper – and a third individual, a Hillary Clinton aide named Monica Hanley. Hanley was interviewed twice by the FBI, on Jan. 11 and June 23. Working for Hillary Clinton as a “confidential assistant,” Hanley joined the State Department in 2009 as Hillary Clinton began her job as secretary of state. Previously, the 35-year-old worked as an intern for Clinton while she served as a U.S. senator for New York.

In the released documents, Hanley emerged as the go-to staffer often tasked with finding replacements to satisfy Clinton’s chosen use of non-secure BlackBerries. Hanley stated she tried to find BlackBerries for sale on eBay and admitted that she made a trip to a mall in Virginia to try to find devices for sale.

Hanley noted a “coffee incident” ruined one of the Clinton’s devices.

In her interviews, Hanley told the FBI that during her time at the State Department, she learned “specifically how to handle and transport classified information/paper but could not recall who provided the training.”

Two emails from Hanley were marked classified with a c for “confidential,” the lowest level of classification. Fox News first reported some of the emails contained classified markings despite Clinton’s public claims.

The FBI document said “Hanley received a Top Secret/SCI clearance at DoS.” Despite the training, during one trip to Russia, Hanley was specifically criticized for leaving a classified document in a hotel suite she shared with Clinton during the trip. “Hanley was informed by DS (Department of State) that the briefing book and document should have never been in the suite,” the document said.

She was also involved in the response to the hack by Guccifer, whose real name is Marcel Lehel Lazar.

Ha.

Hanley learned ‘specifically’ how to transport classified info.

Can’t remember who taught her how to do it, though.

100152,1008,"Uh, Hillary, Your Hubby Caused the 2008 Recession",http://www.americanthinker.com/articles/2016/09/uh_hillary_your_hubby_caused_the_2008_recession.html,6,"On the debate stage Monday night, Hillary Clinton smugly repeated the big lie that Democrats have been telling with something close to impunity since 2008.

“We had the worst financial crisis, the Great Recession, the worst since the 1930s,” said Hillary. “That was in large part because of tax policies that slashed taxes on the wealthy, failed to invest in the middle class, took their eyes off of Wall Street, and created a perfect storm.”

In fact, tax policies had almost nothing to do with the recession of 2008. What caused the market crash was the collapse of the subprime market. If that collapse had an architect-in-chief, his name was Bill Clinton. This is not a speculation. It is an easily documented fact.

When Bill Clinton was inaugurated in 1993, the homeownership rate was lower than it had been when Richard Nixon was inaugurated in 1969. Despite increasing prosperity, despite the growth in the condominium market, the numbers were declining.

The Clintons wanted to push those numbers up. If they had been inclined to look, the explanation for the decline was simple enough: the collapse of the two-parent family. From 1970 to 2000, single-parent households, disproportionately black, increased 60 percent. In that same period, married couples with their own children fell from 40 percent of all households to just 24 percent.

The Clintons and their media allies refused to acknowledge family breakdown as a problem -- remember “Murphy Brown” -- let alone as an explanation for the disparity in home-ownership rates. Their preferred explanation for just about everything unpleasant, then as now, was the inevitable racism. This they could and would freely impute to less enlightened Americans, “the deplorables” as they would come to be known.

The Clintons found the confirmation they were looking for in a 1991 study by the Federal Reserve. According to the study, 61 percent of blacks had been approved in their quest for government-backed home loans as compared to 77 percent for whites. Bingo!

To make the racism story line work, the Clintons had to ignore another significant set of data, namely, default rates. A comprehensive HUD study of FHA loans for the years 1992-1999 found that blacks were defaulting more than twice as frequently as whites, and Hispanics were defaulting three times more frequently. If minorities had been held to a higher standard, their default rates should have been lower than whites, not higher. This was obvious.

No matter. As early as 1993, HUD began to bring legal action against those mortgage bankers who declined a higher percentage of minorities than whites. In 1995, the Clinton administration put teeth in Jimmy Carter’s 1977 Community Reinvestment Act (CRA), which had merely “encouraged” financial institutions to “help meet the credit needs of local communities.” Under Clinton, regulators moved from encouraging to strong-arming.

The regulators were backed by the street-level bullyboy tactics of the late and unlamented ACORN, shorthand for Association of Community Organizations for Reform Now. Historically, banks had been reluctant to offer home loans to people who might not pay them back, and so ACORN set out to embarrass bankers into overcoming that reluctance.

A sympathetic media romanticized ACORN and turned what might have been a nuisance for the banks into a public-relations nightmare. As the New York Times reported approvingly, “The nation’s largest banks have come to the negotiating table just to silence objections that could derail or create costly delays to a merger.”

To make ACORN’s task easier, the Clinton administration demanded that banks quantify the progress they were making in giving loans to LMIs -- people of “low and moderate income.” The administration encouraged banks to use “innovative or flexible” lending practices to reach their LMI numbers.

Meanwhile HUD, which Congress had made the regulator of Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac in 1992, began to pressure these agencies to set numerical goals for affordable housing, even if that meant buying subprime mortgages. The media cheered the agencies on. A September 1999 Times article commended Fannie Mae for prodding banks to provide mortgages to those whose credit was “not good enough to qualify for conventional loans.”

With a gun to their head, the lenders turned to Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac to relieve them of the imprudent loans they were now being forced to make. Before the 1990s, Fannie and Freddie had sufficiently tough lending standards that default was not much of an issue. That would change.

In 1999, the Clintons’ newly appointed CEO, Franklin Delano Raines, was boasting of the changes Fannie Mae had already made and the changes to come. As he told the Times, Fannie Mae had lowered the down payment requirements for a home and now planned to extend credit to borrowers a “notch below its traditional standards.” That notch was spelled subprime.

Given the greater risk, subprime prospects typically have had to pay more interest to secure a loan. For investors, high interest translated into high yield. In October 1997, the investment banks Bear Stearns and First Union Capital Markets underwrote the first securitization of subprime loans for a total of $385 million.

The back-patting press release announcing the launch hit all the bubble-era hot buttons: these “affordable” and “flexible” mortgages offered the possibility of credit for “low and moderate income families” in “traditionally underserved markets.”

These securities proved enormously popular. They promised a 7.5 percent yield in a low-interest environment and, if that were not enough, a chance to cleanse one’s venal Wall Street soul by doing what appeared to be a social good.

To rally the base a week before the 2000 election, the Clinton administration announced historic new regulations that would put a further squeeze on Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac. “These new regulations will greatly enhance access to affordable housing for minorities, urban residents, new immigrants and others left behind, giving millions of families the opportunity to buy homes,” said HUD Secretary, now New York State governor, Andrew Cuomo.

The regs upped Fannie and Freddie’s “affordable housing” quota from 42 to 50 percent. “We have not been a major presence in the subprime market,” boasted CEO Raines, “but you can bet that under these goals, we will be.”

Raines deflected criticism by focusing on Fannie Mae’s success at social engineering. “We have met or exceeded our affordable housing goals, even as they have increased,” he told the Congressional Finance Committee in late 2003. He also shared the company’s “voluntary goal,” namely, to “lead the market in serving minority families.”

When President Bush expressed concern about the precarious state of Fannie and Freddie in June 2004, he triggered seventy-six Democrats in Congress to sign a letter warning that “an exclusive focus on safety and soundness is likely to come, in practice, at the expense of affordable housing.”

Despite early signs of impending disaster, Congress kept the pressure on. On June 27, 2005, Barney Frank, the ranking Democrat on House Financial Services Committee, took to the House floor to chide those who worried about a housing bubble.

“You are not going to see the collapse that you see when people talk about a bubble,” he lectured his colleagues. “So those on our committee in particular are going to continue to push for homeownership.”

And push they did. Subprime credit had become, what one wag called, “the mad cow disease of structured finance.” With a clean bill of health from the media and the Democrats, and a shockingly ignorant assist from Wall Street, the infected product was allowed to poison the entire economy.

No sweat for Hillary. The final convulsion -- Phew! -- occurred on George Bush’s watch.

100153,1008,Hillary Clinton’s Lyin’ Eyes,http://www.americanthinker.com/articles/2016/09/hillary_clintons_lyin_eyes_.html,6,"Long ago in 1976, Bill Clinton was elected Arkansas attorney general, launching his political career and that of his ambitious wife. One year earlier, The Eagles released their hit song “Lyin’ Eyes”. Little did Don Henley and Glenn Frey know that their popular song and Hillary Clinton would have a synchronous moment 40 years later during her presidential campaign.

The lyrics, “You can’t hide your lyin’ eyes” at one level, fits Mrs. Clinton’s life story and political history quite accurately and at another level provides a glimpse into her current health and suitability to serve as president. From the early days in the White House, Mrs. Clinton told lies about Whitewater, missing Rose Law Firm billing records, the White House travel office, and her husband’s trysts. She continued in later years with a second round of lies about being dead broke when leaving the White House, landing under Bosnian sniper fire, being named after Sir Edmund Hillary, and being turned down by the Marines. Round three of her lies are more recent, including Benghazi, her emails, and now her health.

The last issue, her health, has become a major campaign issue. Over the past few weeks, videos have surfaced of Mrs. Clinton’s bizarre eye movements and their health implications. Despite all of her previous lies, this time she won’t be able to hide her “Lyin’ eyes.”

Her uncoordinated eye movements are just the latest of a string of medical concerns. Facial tics and spasms, needing assistance going up a short flight of steps, four-minute coughing fits, and her famous 9/11 collapse. This collapse was blamed on pneumonia which Mrs. Clinton miraculously recovered from a few hours later. Her personal physician, Dr. Lisa Bardack, assures an apprehensive electorate, “She continues to remain healthy and fit to serve as President of the United States.""

What about Mrs. Clinton’s eye gyrations, reminiscent of Regan from The Exorcist? This started in 2012 when she fell, suffered a concussion and brain hemorrhage, treated with Coumadin, a powerful blood thinner. Not just a bump on the head, but instead “a terrible concussion that required six months of very serious work to get over” according to her husband former president Bill Clinton.

Her blood clot was actually a cerebral venous thrombosis, a blood clot in one of the sinuses that collects blood draining from the brain. Potentially life threatening, this can occur following trauma or due to an increased blood clotting tendency in the body, hence her continued use of Coumadin.

Long-term complications include seizures, visual deficits, muscle weakness, spasticity, and memory deficits. These are all complications that may be inferred through watching recent videos of Mrs. Clinton.

Her crossed eyes were first evident during her Congressional testimony about Benghazi. Photos show her wearing Fresnel prisms in her eyeglasses, used to correct eye misalignment and double vision. That was four years ago. What about her recent crossed eyes?

Each eye has six muscles attached, controlling eye movement up, down, diagonally, and rotationally. These muscles are innervated by three cranial nerves which originate in the brain stem, which lies between the brain and spinal cord, and then travel upward to the eyes. These nerves are easily damaged by trauma or compression from brain swelling or hemorrhage.

Cerebral venous thrombosis may damage cranial nerves. Not only those controlling eye movement, but also facial muscles, inner ear balance, throat muscles affecting speech, swallowing, and coughing. Remember some of Mrs. Clinton’s facial tics and prolonged coughing episodes?

After damage, the nerves try to heal themselves. Sometimes successfully, sometimes not. Synkinesis describes the latter situation. Rather than the injured nerves reconnecting properly, they may get mixed up and reestablish the wrong connections. Meaning that when the brain tells one eye to look left, it may look right instead. Or up. Or down.

Other nerves may also be rewire incorrectly. Suppose the facial nerve, controlling smiling, chewing, and facial expressions, mistakenly shares nerve fibers with the nerves controlling eye movement. Speaking to an audience using facial expressions may cause the eyes to move in unintended directions.

This is speculation. As an ophthalmologist and physician, I can observe, think, and make deductions. But not as Mrs. Clinton’s doctor, who would have the benefit of her complete medical history and a detailed ocular and neurologic examination.

Abnormal eye movements are not uncommon. Called strabismus, many people have a crossed eye due to a previous eye injury, surgery, or a childhood lazy eye. Some elderly individuals, particularly diabetics, have small strokes of the nerves controlling eye movement, leading to a strabismus.

Mrs. Clinton, however, has more than a crossed eye. She has a complicated medical history including severe concussion, blood clot, chronic Coumadin therapy, and a host of other concerning signs such as possible seizures, balance issues, collapsing, and her coughing fits.

I’m not rendering a definitive diagnosis. Apart from what I described above, other possibilities have been put forth including Parkinson’s disease and brain cancer. Regardless of the actual diagnosis, it doesn’t take a physician to realize that something is wrong with her health.

Are these legitimate concerns regarding a potential president? CNN is fretting over Donald Trump being overweight with a high cholesterol reading. Big whoop. Over a third of Americans are obese according to the CDC. I’m quite certain that if Mr. Trump collapsed, needed help up a few steps, had a four-minute coughing fit, or had intermittent crossed eyes, the media would be hyperventilating and talking about nothing else.

Eight years ago, John McCain’s health was much discussed by the media with regard to his age and history of melanoma. Was he too old? Could his cancer return? Only four years older when he was seeking the nomination than Mrs. Clinton is now, one thought the grim reaper was sitting atop his shoulder.

Yet those questioning Mrs. Clinton’s health are conspiracy kooks, part of the “vast right wing conspiracy”, card-carrying members of “The Deplorables”, called “healthers” as the new “birthers”. Mrs. Clinton is not running for Chappaqua town council, but for commander in chief of the United States. Her health is a legitimate concern. Despite her “Lyin’ Eyes”."
100154,1008,Trump's Taxes? Audit the Clinton Foundation!,http://www.americanthinker.com/articles/2016/09/trumps_taxes_audit_the_clinton_foundation.html,6,"Perhaps Sen. Harry Reid should sue Hillary Clinton for copyright infringement. The former Secretary of State went after Donald Trump for failing to release his tax returns, suggesting that it could be because he is not as charitable as he claims or maybe he didn’t pay any taxes on his fortune. it was eerily reminiscent of the lie Harry Reid admitted telling in 2012 about Mitt Romney:

One of the strangest incidents of the 2012 presidential campaign was when then-Senate Majority Leader Harry M. Reid accused then-Republican presidential nominee Mitt Romney of having not paid any taxes over the past decade. That Reid made that allegation from the floor of the Senate made it even odder.

The problem with Reid's allegation? It's just not true. We know that, at least in 2011 and 2010, Romney did pay taxes. How do we know that? Because Romney released his tax returns for those years. In 2011, Romney paid $1.9 million in taxes; in 2010, he paid slightly more than $3 million in taxes.

Our own Fact Checker gave Reid Four Pinocchios for his ""no taxes"" claim. PolitiFact gave the claim a ""Pants on Fire"" rating.

Yet Reid (D-Nev.) not only refuses to retract the allegation but also seems to take great pride in it. When pressed by CNN's Dana Bash last year about continuing to defend a statement that is not true, Reid responded, ""Romney didn't win, did he?""

Hillary Clinton is hoping her innuendo about Trump’s tax returns will have the same effect. Trump’s response that he’ll release them against the wishes of his lawyers if she releases her 33,000 deleted emails was weak. If he paid no taxes and did so legally, he should release his returns. But the challenge to Hillary should have been that he’ll release his returns if she explains how the Clintons amassed a not-so-small fortune while engaged in “public service” and agree to an audit of the Clinton Foundation.

How is it, Madam Secretary, that your husband’s speaking fees doubled after you became Secretary of State? Did your husband suddenly become more articulate and experienced? Or did they know that the way to your heart might be through your husband’s wallet? Was the reason you deleted those 33,000 emails that they contained evidence of why you really set up your own unsecured private server – the “pay-for play” contributions by donors to the Clinton Foundation seeking favors and access?

How is it, Secretary Clinton, that the Clinton Foundation accepted donations from countries and individuals that support the execution of homosexuals, throwing them off buildings and who support Sharia Law and state-sponsored suppression and abuse of women and their rights?

As Investor’s Business Daily editorialized, donations to the Clinton Foundation even played a factor in the refusal of Hillary Clinton’s State Department to designate Nigeria’s Boko Haram as a terrorist organization for two years:

Hillary's emails may be only the tip of an iceberg that could include Clinton Foundation donations to shield Boko Haram from being designated a terrorist group and her brother's involvement in a Haitian gold mine…

Last month, the Washington Post reported on another deal involving Rodham that could prove politically embarrassing and damaging for his sister. It seems that he sits on the board of a company that got a coveted gold-mining contract from the government of Haiti after the Clinton Foundation sponsored relief work in Haiti.

In interviews with the Post, both Rodham and the chief executive of Delaware-based VCS Mining said they were introduced at a meeting of the Clinton Global Initiative, which seems more and more to be an unseemly mix of charitable work with the political and business interests of Clinton Foundation donors.

And then there's Hillary's strange dealings regarding the Nigerian terrorist group Boko Haram, which just recently pledged its allegiance to the ever-expanding Islamic State -- dubbed the ""JV team"" by President Obama, who has yet to make good on his pledge to degrade and destroy them.

Last May, we wondered why for two years on Hillary Clinton's watch the State Department refused to designate a Nigerian Islamist group as a terrorist organization. This group has murdered thousands as it wages a real war on women. As Josh Rogin at the Daily Beast reports, the Clinton State Department ""refused to place Boko Haram on the list of foreign terrorist organizations in 2011"" after the group bombed the United Nations headquarters in Abuja, Nigeria.

Sen. David Vitter, R-La., sent a letter to Secretary of State John Kerry last week asking for all of Hillary's records relating to Boko Haram and her reluctance to designate it a foreign terrorist organization.

Vitter also requested all of Hillary's communications with Gilbert Chagoury, a Nigerian construction tycoon who has donated millions to the Clinton Foundation. Vitter noted that Chagoury had a financial interest in the potential impact of designating Boko Haram a terrorist group

How many of the more than 30,000 ""personal"" emails that Hillary deleted from her private account relate to these matters? Is that why she needed a private email server? We need to see that server. It might provide, er, a veritable gold mine of information.

Yet, for some reason, the slush fund that is the Clinton Foundation never came up in the debate nor did Donald Trump bring it up. Corruption has been a Clinton hallmark. The Clintons have made a career of making a fortune on the dime of a public they intentionally deceive and defraud, using their positions of power to enrich themselves at the public’s expense. Before there was “pay for play” at the Clinton Foundation, perhaps the real reason for the private server and the deletion of 30,000 emails, William Safire wrote of Hillary’s amazing 10,000 percent profit in commodities trading which Hillary credited ro astute reading of the Wall Street Journal:

We now know that was a lie told to turn aside accusations that as the Governor's wife she profited corruptly, her account being run by a lawyer for state poultry interests through a disreputable broker.

The Clinton Foundation scandal does indeed remind one of the days when the Clintons were renting out the Lincoln Bedroom and Johnny Chung famously observed that the White House was like a subway turnstile, saying you had to put money in to gain access.

Trump should release his tax returns, Hillary, when you agree to an audit of the Clinton Foundation.

100155,1009,THE ISSUES DISAPPEAR FROM THE PRESIDENTIAL CAMPAIGN,http://www.powerlineblog.com/archives/2016/09/the-issues-disappear-from-the-presidential-campaign.php,6,"A funny thing has happened as we approach Election Day: the issues have more or less disappeared; or, at least, the press has stopped talking about them.

Donald Trump raced to the front of the GOP pack by focusing on illegal immigration. For months, liberals inside and outside of the press denounced Trump’s immigration views, accusing him of being a bigot, etc. But immigration has now disappeared from the news. In the first Clinton-Trump debate, moderator Leslie Holt never mentioned the subject. Why? Democrats understand that most voters side with Trump.

Likewise with trade. Here, in my opinion, Trump is vulnerable, but the issue is still too risky for the Left. Therefore, the less said the better.

How about our declining military, the Iran deal, Hillary Clinton’s criminal mishandling of classified information, the weakest recovery since WWII, stagnant wages, the war on cops and a suddenly rising crime rate, the Libya fiasco, and Obamacare, a failure by any accounting? Where have all the issues gone? Off the front pages, every one, and so far, out of the debates.

The issues that voters care most about appear to be off the table until the election is safely over. Instead, editors and reporters are feeding us a steady diet of Trump’s tax returns, a reprise of birtherism, and Alicia Machado, a person, evidently, of great significance. You could say she is the Quemoy and Matsu of this election, but that understates the case.

It is obvious what is going on here. Donald Trump closed the gap with Hillary Clinton by giving a series of sound, substantive speeches on the economy, immigration and crime. Voters tend to agree with his views on most of these issues, and as long as he was talking about them, Hillary Clinton was in trouble. So the press did what it does best: it changed the subject.

Trump, of course, bears some responsibility. He is not a skillful candidate, and sometimes he doesn’t have the sense to come in out of the rain. Or to stop talking about Ms. Machado. All too often, he has gone along with reporters who are obviously trying to throw him off his game.

Still, it’s not too late. If Trump gets back to the issues and stops rising to the bait every time a reporter tries to distract him, he can still win. The problem is that to do this, he must keep his ego in check. Trump needs to remember that the election is not about him, his business dealings or his petty rivalries, it is about the future of the United States of America. Whether he can do this remains to be seen."
100156,1009,FRIDAY ON MY MIND,http://www.powerlineblog.com/archives/2016/09/friday-on-my-mind.php,6,"Late this past Friday afternoon the FBI conducted its second document dump in the Clinton email case. To those paying attention it has become clear that the case has compromised the FBI and destroyed the reputation of FBI Director of James Comey. These Friday afternoon document dumps come straight from the scandal management playbook perfected under the (Bill) Clinton administration. They remind us, in case any reminder was necessary, of how much we have to look forward to in the event the Clintons return to the White House. I nevertheless find it shocking that the FBI itself has now adopted the routine, acting as a party with much to be ashamed of. I collected early pieces and a few related revelations presenting a first take on the 190 pages of interview notes in “Scandal management with the FBI.”

In the New York Observer John Schindler explains “The FBI investigation of emailgate was a sham.” Subhead: “We now have incontrovertible proof the Bureau never had any intention of prosecuting Hillary Clinton.” Andrew McCarthy’s NRO column similarly argues “Obama’s conflict tanked the Clinton email investigation.”

Among the revelations reported over the weekend in the first pass at the documents was President Obama’s use of a pseudonym in email correspondence with Clinton on on the private email account maintained on her insecure server. Now Jonathan Allen reports for Reuters: “Clinton server tech told FBI of colleagues’ worries about system.” Excerpt:

“… The newly released interview summaries from the FBI investigation show government employees undercutting other aspects of the public accounts given by Clinton and senior State officials.

“A State Department employee, whose name was redacted, told investigators they believed senior department officials interfered with the screening of Clinton’s emails for public release …

“The employee, who worked on the screening process, said there was pressure to obscure the fact they were finding classified information in the messages. … Clinton repeatedly said last year she never sent or received classified information …

“The State Department has said that Clinton did not include any of her emails with Petraeus when her lawyers screened and returned what they said were all her work emails in 2014. A single conversation of about 10 emails later emerged last year after the Defense Department provided it.

“The employee also said the Defense Department told the State Department last year it had found about 1,000 emails between Clinton and David Petraeus in its records from his time as the director of the United States Central Command.” …

At PJ Media Debra Heine expands on that last bombshell regarding the deleted Petraeus emails in “FBI Docs: Hillary Deleted Nearly 1,000 Emails With David Petraeus.” Excerpt:

“A potentially explosive nugget from the FBI’s Friday document dump of investigatory notes from the Clinton email probe has been all but ignored by the media. And that is the revelation that Hillary Clinton deleted 1,000 work-related emails between herself and General David Pet[r]aeus from his time as the director of the United States Central Command. …

“In August of 2015, she signed a statement to a federal judge declaring “under penalty of perjury” that she turned over all work-related emails. …

“Petraeus started out as the leader of U.S. Central Command and then became the director of the CIA during Clinton’s tenure as secretary of State, so not only were those emails obviously work related, they very likely were highly classified. The implications here are staggering.

But it gets worse.

The FBI summary also revealed that top State Department officials were actually putting pressure on employees to hide the fact that they were finding classified information in Clinton’s emails.” …

Today Catherine Herridge and Pamela Browne report “FBI doc dump on email case reveals role of ‘confidential’ Clinton aide.” It is an article replete with evidence of additional criminal misconduct in the Clinton email scandal."
100157,1009,COMEY ON THE STABBING RAMPAGE,http://www.powerlineblog.com/archives/2016/09/comey-on-the-stabbing-rampage.php,6,"FBI Director James Comey appeared on Capitol Hill for an oversight hearing held by the House Judiciary Committee today. GOP members focused their questions primarily on the FBI’s handling of the Hillary Clinton email investigation and Comey’s ultimate decision not to recommend charges against the former secretary of state. The C-SPAN video of the hearing is posted here. I found the questioning by Reps. Sensenbrenner, Jordan, Gowdy, Franks, Ratcliffe, Trott and others to be intensely interesting.

The Washington Times succinctly delivers the good news and the bad news. The good news is that Comey made clear he has not cleared Madam Hillary of lying in the case. The bad news is that she will not be brought to justice.

Rep. Ron DeSantis represents Florida’s Sixth District, but he turned his questioning to events in Minnesota (video of Rep. DeSantis’s line of questions below). Law enforcement authorities in Minnesota have gone silent on the case. Thanks to Rep. DeSantis for taking it up with Comey. Responding to Rep. DeSantis’s questions about the status of the FBI investigation of Dahir Adan’s stabbing rampage in St. Cloud a week ago Sunday, Comey states: “It does look like at least in part he was motivated by some sort of inspiration from radical Islamic groups, which groups and how we’re not sure of yet.”

Rep. DeSantis asks what’s going on in Minnesota generally. He puts the question this way: “Why is Minnesota turning out so many jihadists?” Comey cites Minnesota’s large and concentrated Somali community. Comey, however, downplays the number involved. “Again we’re talking about eight people [who have departed Minnesota to join terrorist groups], I think the number is,” he says, and praises the cooperation of Minnesota’s Somali community with law enforcement.

The Star Tribune’s Stephen Montemayor covers Rep. DeSantis’s questions and Comey’s testimony here without noting the misleading aspects of Comey’s testimony. The terrorism case that went to trial in May included a group of 10 defendants, plus one recently charged defendant who is in Syria, plus one co-conspirator turned informant who hasn’t been charged. The group in that case numbers at least 12 all by itself.

Six of the 10 defendants pleaded guilty before trial. Two of the six entered into cooperation agreements with the government and testified at trial. Contrary to the gist of Comey’s remarks, the informant and two cooperating defendants took a lot of abuse within the Somali community for testifying against their three colleagues who went to trial — so much that Minneapolis FBI Division Special Agent in Charge Richard Thornton made the following statement at the press conference immediately following the guilty verdicts that were returned on June 3: “I find it shameful that some so-called community leaders have tried to vilify the confidential human source in this case. There is something wrong when you blame the person who did the right thing and defend those who were clearly in the wrong.”"
100158,1010,That ‘basket of deplorables’ Clinton mentioned? This is what she was talking about.,https://thinkprogress.org/trump-supporters-think-minorities-have-too-much-influence-polling-says-deplorable-151d0038b50a#.a5gqvus43,6,"Weeks after Hillary Clinton notoriously said that half of opponent Donald Trump’s supporters could be placed into a “basket of deplorables,” a new poll reinforces the point she was making.
According to a Langer Research Associates survey, 38 percent of Trump supporters think minorities have too much influence in American society. Despite the fact that white men constitute 80 percent of Congress while only comprising 31 percent of the country’s population, the survey found that 21 percent of Trump supporters actually think white people don’t have enough influence.
 On the other hand, 67 percent of Clinton supporters think minorities have too little influence, and just seven percent think whites don’t have enough.
Trump and Clinton supporters also diverge in their views on how much power women currently have in America. Twenty-one percent of Trump supporters think women have too little power, compared to 58 percent of Clinton supporters. “Controlling for demographics, partisanship, ideology and presidential approval, seeing too little influence for whites and men and too much influence for minorities and women independently predicts support for Trump,” a summary of the poll says. “Other than disapproval of Barack Obama, which is by far the best predictor of support for Trump, views of group influence have a similar effect as partisanship, ideology and race.”
Polls conducted earlier this year found that 65 percent of Trump supporters believe Obama is a Muslim; 59 percent believe Obama wasn’t born in the United States; 40 percent believe blacks are more “lazy” than whites; 31 percent support banning homosexuals from the country; 16 percent believe whites are a superior race; and 20 percent disagree with Lincoln’s signing of the Emancipation Proclamation, which freed Southern slaves.
For context, Clinton’s comment about “the basket of deplorables”_—_those with “racist, sexist, homophobic, xenophobic, [and] Islamophobic ” views_—_was directed toward 50 percent of Trump supporters. That’s a greater percentage than those who believe minorities currently have too much power according to the new poll, but a lesser percentage than those who believe Obama is a Muslim_—_a quickly discredited conspiracy theory that nonetheless brought Trump to national political prominence. "
100159,1010,Trump campaign caught lying about Roger Ailes,https://thinkprogress.org/trump-and-the-art-of-the-super-casual-lie-3a0c07e590d9#.gvumpf7in,6,"Trump and his campaign engage in a lot of big lies. They claim, falsely, repeatedly, that he can’t release his tax returns, opposed the Iraq war and “ended birtherism.”
But even more revealing of Trump’s relationship with the truth are the small lies. The obvious lies about things that are much less consequential. They demonstrate not an elaborate plan to mislead the public but a simple contempt for the truth.
Take for example Roger Ailes, the former CEO of Fox News who was ousted from his job in July after numerous women accused him of sexual harassment.
In August, the New York Times reported that Ailes, who has a storied career as a right-wing political operative, would be assisting Trump in preparations for the presidential debates. This was a bit unseemly in light of the allegations that freed up Ailes’ time, but hardly surprising. Fox News, under Ailes’ leadership, operated largely as an extension of the Republican Party.
The Trump campaign quickly, and adamantly, denied the report. The Hollywood Reporter had the story:
Donald Trump’s campaign vehemently denies that Roger Ailes, the former head of Fox News who recently resigned amid sexual harassment allegations, is now working with Trump ahead of the presidential debates.
“He is not advising Mr. Trump or helping with debate prep. They are longtime friends, but he has no formal or informal role in the campaign,” Hope Hicks, Trump campaign spokeswoman, told The Hollywood Reporter.
That was a very clear statement from the campaign.
KellyAnne Conway appeared on CNN a couple of days later and confirmed that Ailes would not “to my knowledge” be helping Trump prepare for the debates.
 On Monday, the first debate between Trump and Hillary Clinton was held. Who helped Trump prepare for the debate? Roger Ailes.
According to the New York Times, he not only was involved with preparations but “led” a “debate-prep camp” with Trump.
There were early efforts to run a more standard form of general election debate-prep camp, led by Roger Ailes, the ousted Fox News chief, at Mr. Trump’s golf course in Bedminster, N.J. But Mr. Trump found it hard to focus during those meetings, according to multiple people briefed on the process who requested anonymity to discuss internal deliberations. That left Mr. Ailes, who at the time was deeply distracted by his removal from Fox and the news media reports surrounding it, discussing his own problems as well as recounting political war stories, according to two people present for the sessions.
Why would the campaign, who was obviously aware of Ailes’s involvement, lie to the press? There is no obvious reason.
It seems that Trump and his campaign don’t need much of a reason."

The question, debated at multiple meetings at the White House, is how aggressively to respond to the Russian operation. Publicly naming and shaming the Russians and describing what the intelligence community knows about their activities would help Americans understand and respond prudently to any disruptions that might take place between now and the close of the polls. Senior Justice Department officials have argued in favor of calling out the Russians, and that position has been echoed forcefully outside of government by lawmakers and former top national-security officials from both political parties.
Unfortunately, it’s not that simple. The President and several of his closest national-security advisers are concerned about the danger of a confrontation in the new and ungoverned world of cyberspace, and they argue that while the U.S. has powerful offensive and defensive capabilities there, an escalating confrontation carries significant risks. National Security Council officials warn that our critical infrastructure–including the electricity grid, transportation sector and energy networks–is vulnerable to first strikes; others say attacks on private companies, stock exchanges and the media could affect the economy. Senior intelligence officials even worry about Russia exposing U.S. espionage operations in retaliation. And while U.S. officials have “high confidence” that Russia is behind what they describe as a major influence operation, senior U.S. officials tell TIME, their evidence would not yet stand up in court.
So intelligence has ""high confidence"" that it's Russia. Or, you know, it could be Donald Trump's 400-pound hacker sitting on his bed. Or China. Or maybe even Donald Trump's 10-year-old son, Barron, though that part is kind of hazy, since maybe the kid is supposed to be fighting off the hackers. "
100161,1001,Trump's campaign manager confirms that he broke the law by seeking investments in Cuba,http://www.dailykos.com/stories/2016/9/29/1575920/-Trump-s-campaign-manager-confirms-that-he-broke-the-law-by-seeking-investments-in-Cuba,7,"This morning, reports emerged that Donald Trump illegally did business in Castro's Cuba.

 A company controlled by Donald Trump, the Republican nominee for president, secretly conducted business in communist Cuba during Fidel Castro’s presidency despite strict American trade bans that made such undertakings illegal, according to interviews with former Trump executives, internal company records and court filings.
Not surprisingly, Trump surrogates have been confronted by this story today, and no one has been more vigorous in her defense of Donald Trump than campaign manager Kellyanne Conway.

Read the entire story. It starts out with a screaming headline, as it usually does, that he did business in Cuba. And it turns out that he decided not to invest there. They paid money, as I understand, in 1998 — and we’re not supposed to talk about many years ago when it comes to the Clintons.
Yeah. Who knows what the Clintons were up to in 1998? Anyway, there’s just one little problem with Conway saying that Donald Trump spent money looking for investments in Cuba but decided not to buy. If you can’t read the tiny text, the points say:

These manufactured reports from a totally discredited reporter are pathetic.

Kurt Eichewald sourced 90% of the report from company documents.

The Clinton Spin Machine and their allies in the media are getting desperate, and it’s pretty sad tha they have to go back 10, 20, or even 30 years to try and attack Mr. Trump.

It’s 18 years … and considering that nearly every talking point the Trump campaign has used since the debate has involved Bill Clinton’s affairs in the 1980s and 1990s … yeah.

Can you imagine if MSNBC dedicated even five minutes for a story on how the Clintons made their money by selling access and rewarding their special interest donors?

Well, every penny the Clintons have made for 30+ years is public because they released their taxes. And do you really want to add up how many minutes were spent talking about Clinton Foundation only to find there was no scandal involved?

Documents show that the Trump company spent a minimum of $68,000 for its 1998 foray into Cuba at a time when the corporate expenditure of even a penny in the Caribbean country was prohibited without U.S. government approval. But the company did not spend the money directly. Instead, with Trump’s knowledge, executives funneled the cash for the Cuba trip through an American consulting firm called Seven Arrows Investment and Development Corp. Once the business consultants traveled to the island and incurred the expenses for the venture, Seven Arrows instructed senior officers with Trump’s company—then called Trump Hotels & Casino Resorts—how to make it appear legal by linking it after the fact to a charitable effort.
This comes just as the investigation into other ways Trump has misused a charitable foundation is exploding.

Thanks for the confirmation, Kellyanne."
100162,1001,New York attorney general expands investigation of Donald Trump Foundation,http://www.dailykos.com/stories/2016/9/29/1575885/-New-York-Attorney-General-expands-investigation-of-Donald-Trump-Foundation#read-more,7,"Donald Trump took $100,000 out of his foundation and gave it to a political group trying to stop the re-election of New York Attorney General Eric Schneiderman. Bad news for Trump, it wasn't enough.

The New York attorney general's investigation of the Donald J. Trump Foundation appears to have broadened to include new allegations of self-dealing by Trump that surfaced after the probe began, TPM has learned.
The “self-dealing” is primarily associated with how Donald Trump used foundation money to pay his own bills.

Donald Trump spent more than a quarter-million dollars from his charitable foundation to settle lawsuits that involved the billionaire’s for-profit businesses, according to interviews and a review of legal documents.
The self-dealing even included paying off a lawsuit Donald Trump acquired by trying to cheat someone at a charity golf tournament. 

The investigation by the New York attorney general also includes looking into gifts Trump has purchased for himself using foundation funds, including a signed football helmet and at least two giant portraits of Trump.

Self-dealing -- or the use of a charity's money to the personal benefit of one of its operators -- is a major no-no in charity world, and a violation of both state law in New York, where the Trump Foundation is registered, and IRS regulations, according to legal and tax experts.
Millennial voters are key at defeating Donald Trump, and NextGen Climate has a way to reach them in swing states. No matter where you live, click here to volunteer to make calls, texts and find other ways to help out.

All of this information has surfaced because of the relentless work by David Fahrenthold at the Washington Post, who has simply gone through the foundation’s books and checked the validity item by item. 

The Trump campaign attacked Fahrenthold and the Washington Post, calling the reporting inaccurate and biased. However, Trump’s response included not a single example showing an error on Fahrenthold’s part, and further attempts to elicit specifics from Donald Trump, Junior Trump, or Trump’s campaign have all come up dry.

""The Trump campaign's response to our reporting has been full of personal insults and devoid of any discussion of the facts,"" senior politics editor Steven Ginsberg said in a statement. ""We have reached out to the campaign repeatedly, by phone, email and on social media, and they have yet to answer our questions. We welcome a response that addresses the legitimate questions raised about the Trump Foundation.""
What does the IRS define as self-dealing?

Sale or exchange or leasing of property
Lending of money or other extension of credit
Furnishing of goods, services or facilities
Payment or compensation
Transfer to, or use by or for the benefit of a disqualified person of the asset of a foundation
Paying off legal fees. Purchasing items “for the foundation” that are instead being used by Trump … Donald Trump has managed to tick just about every item on the list.

And that doesn’t even touch on the other ways Trump has misused his foundation, like using the foundation to avoid taxes and using it as a source of political payoffs. And all that is still in addition to the investigation Eric Schneiderman has underway of the Trump University fraud.

With all that on his plate, Schneiderman is likely to be busy dissecting Trump’s misdeeds for years. Years and years.

But if he was to hurry up at least a charge or two, America would appreciate it."
100163,1002,How Trump’s Critics Are Helping Him Win the Next Two Debates,http://www.breitbart.com/big-government/2016/09/29/debates-trump-critics-win-next-two/,7,"In the three days since the first presidential debate, Donald Trump’s critics have become increasingly shrill. They have taken what was, to a plurality of viewers, a narrow win for Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton, and they have tried to inflate it to a massive victory.
Their agenda is obvious: voters like winners, so making Clinton an even bigger winner could be a way to improve her poll numbers. But the hyperbole is helping Trump set expectations that guarantee he wins the next two debates.

As this author predicted, Trump would lose the first debate, largely because Clinton’s health problems lowered expectations for her, even below where they had been for Trump. Initially, Trump faced lower expectations, because he is less experienced at debates. But after Clinton collapsed at the 9/11 memorial, some observers wondered whether she could stand through a full 90 minutes of debating. She did that — with nary a cough. Moderator Lester Holt also weighed in heavily in Clinton’s favor.

Yet, as this author explained after the debate, Trump’s loss in the first debate made it likely that he will win the second and third debates. There are five reasons. First, Trump will now benefit from low expectations in the second debate that carry over into the third, since his first win will still be seen as a fluke. Second, the moderators will be under pressure to be less biased than Holt was. Third, Trump will benefit from the town hall format in the second debate, because he has spoken more often to real voters than Clinton has done recently. Fourth, Trump has home field advantage in Las Vegas for the third debate. And fifth, Trump’s improvement over time will show that he can learn on the job, as he will have to do in the White House.

Had Trump actually melted down on Monday, as the New York Times‘ Charles Blow pretends, any mistakes in later debates would have reinforced that first impression. But because he was competent, even while losing, Trump set himself up for wins.

Perhaps fearing a comeback, Trump’s critics are trying to squeeze every possible advantage out of Clinton’s win on Monday. But they are setting him up for even bigger wins — and setting Clinton up for a fall. Take, for example, Paul Waldman, writing at The Week. He predicts that Clinton will win the second debate — and his reasons come down to preconceived notions of the candidates: Trump as a blustering fool, Clinton as not only smart but also empathic. Waldman actually declares, without any irony, that “relating to other humans one-on-one is something Hillary Clinton is actually very good at” — something that we know from opinion polls is not true, and which her campaign also knows is untrue, since they do not allow it to happen often.

Waldman also argues Trump is incapable of learning or improvement. That flies in the face of Trump’s improved polls since mid-August, when he became a more disciplined candidate.

It also sets expectations so low Trump is certain to clear them."

In a rally at Council Bluffs, Iowa, Trump says, “Everything you need to know about Hillary Clinton can be understood with this simple phrase: Follow the money.”

Trump referred to the testimony earlier in the afternoon by FBI Director James B. Comey Jr., in front of Congress–when Comey had to answer for his decision to grant associates of Clinton immunity from prosecution.

“Her staff took the Fifth and her ringleaders are getting immunity,” he said.

It looks like something you would see dealing with the mob, he said.

If the regular person did what Clinton and her team did with her private email scheme that person would be in great trouble, he said.


 Clinton and her team deleted 33,000 emails after receiving a congressional subpoena for all of her emails–not only deleting them, but also bringing in a specialist to “bleach” her hard drive to remove any trace, Trump said.

But, both Republicans and Democrats let her off the hook, he said. “I was so disappointed with the people in Washington for allowing her to get away with it.”

Not only did Clinton get away with deleting and bleaching her emails, she also destroyed 13 cellphones with a hammer, he said.

In past campaign events, the New York City developer has talked about the Democratic nominee and her shady relationships and and he often used the line: “She turned the State Department into her own hedge fund.”

But, never before has Trump been so precise and focused on what he calls the “the politics of profit.”

Trump told his Hawkeye State supporters that the Clinton campaign has accepted $100 million dollars from Wall Street and the hedge funds.

Trump leads the former first lady in Iowa according to polls. President Barack Obama beat his Republican rival Mitt Romney with 52 percent to Romney’s  47 percent in Iowa in 2012.

In her private sector career as a motivational speaker, Clinton collected $4.1 million in honoraria from financial services firms.

What did she say? Trump asked.

“I’d like to see what she said–where are the papers?” he asked.

“If she ever got the chance, she would put the Oval Office for sale,” he said. “We can’t let that happen.”

It was very common for companies lobbying the federal government to hire Mr. or Mrs. Clinton for a speech.

Returning to the former secretary of state’s public life, Trump said 22 groups lobbying the State Department hired Bill Clinton for speeches.

“We are going to end Clinton corruption–total corruption,” he said.

It is important to remember who the former first lady is fighting for, he said.

“Hillary Clinton is an insider fighting for her donors and her insiders-mostly fighting for herself,” Trump said. “I am an outsider fighting for you–we are fighting together.”"

Mills was granted immunity in the Clinton email case. Why? Comey told the Senate that Mills’ immunity was a negotiation “tool to get the laptop.”

Breitbart News reported that Mills, like Clinton, never signed mandatory security forms pertaining to the handling of classified information. Mills was granted immunity to protect her from prosecution while fellow Clinton aide Huma Abedin, who DID sign mandatory security forms, was not.

100166,1003,Why The Pundits Are Wrong About Hillary Clinton Dominating The Debate,http://www.huffingtonpost.com/gleb-tsipursky/why-the-pundits-are-wrong_1_b_12245136.html?utm_hp_ref=politics,7,"The vast majority of pundits declared Hillary Clinton the decisive winner of this week’s debate. This includes both conservative and liberal pundits. For instance, Douglas Schoen of Fox News wrote:

“She was ready for all of his quips with a litany of detail that may have bored the viewer at points, but showed why she is winning on qualifications, experience and temperament in every poll.”

However, most post-debate online polls are breaking for Donald Trump as the winner. These polls are not rigorous, in that anyone can vote in them multiple times, regardless of whether they would vote in the actual election. Still, some of these polls have hundreds of thousands of votes. They provide significant evidence of enthusiasm for Trump’s debate performance and suggest that the pundits are wrong about Clinton dominating the debate.

So what explains this difference between the polls and the pundits?

As an expert on the role of emotional intelligence in public life, including in debates, I have long observed that mainstream media commentators don’t give sufficient credit to the role of emotions in shaping public perceptions. Understanding the impact of emotions in politics is key for making an accurate prediction of how debates will impact voting.

Pundits vs. the public

Pundits tend to focus on the substance of the debate by analyzing the content of each candidate’s statements. Schoen’s quote above is typical of what pundits value: policy details that express appropriate qualifications and experience.

This focus on content fails to fully reflect what actually influences the viewing public - body language and tone of voice.

The first-ever presidential debate, between Richard Nixon and John F. Kennedy, was apparently seen as a tie by those who listened on the radio. Yet, those who watched on television and got to compare the energetic and healthy-looking Kennedy with the pale, shifty-eyed Nixon saw the former as the winner.

In the presidential debates most Americans focus more on nonverbal cues of body language, and remember them after the debate is over, compared to the content of what is said, according to David Givens, director of the Center for Nonverbal Studies, a private nonprofit research center. These nonverbals are of fundamental importance to communication, and they often mean more than what is actually being said.

This is something that traditional pundits fail to give due credit. This failure can be seen in previous debates in which Trump participated for the Republican presidential nomination. In most cases, pundits declared that Trump was defeated by his competitors, but he won in post-debate online polling and ended up with the nomination.

Research on emotional intelligence provides key clues for why Trump ended up on top. Emotional intelligence is the ability to perceive and influence the emotions of others. While we perceive ourselves to be rational beings, in reality studies show that our emotions dominate most of our mental processes. Donald Trump during the first presidential debate.

Emotional intelligence is especially important for leaders due to the phenomenon of emotional contagion - the ability to “infect” large numbers of people with your emotions. Research shows that emotionally intelligent leaders are especially skilled at emotional contagion. This is a fundamental component of what scholars call charisma, the whole complement of factors that enables a leader to influence others through the leader’s personality.

In my work on the role of emotional intelligence in public life, I have long highlighted Trump’s strength in playing to the emotions of his audience. He has succeeded in being perceived by the public as more honest and authentic, despite fact checkers saying otherwise. Emotional intelligence and the first debate

Charisma has long been a weak area for Clinton. She has struggled to overcome the persistent impression that she’s inauthentic, cold and distant, which she says emerged from her learning as a young woman to control her emotions. In this debate, Clinton needed to demonstrate a better sense of emotional connection to the audience to win over important demographics, such as Bernie Sanders supporters.

Despite her command of policy and substance, Clinton did not in my view succeed in conveying strong emotions during the debate. For instance, in the part of the debate about the economy, the most important issue for U.S. voters, she conveyed a clear plan, with strong evidence backing it up. In her debate preparation she likely worked on injecting emotions into her presentation through telling stories, a classical way of conveying emotions. She shared some powerful stories of people suffering from the poor economy and how her policies would help them out.

But her nonverbal cues - body language and tone of voice - showed lack of emotional expression. For instance, in this moment in the debate, Clinton talks about helping people who are struggling to balance family and work, and experience various stresses.

Yet her tone and body language do not change to reflect these emotional topics. She did not gesture or change her voice to express empathy with those who struggle and have stress. She looks the same as she does a little later or earlier when talking about policy details.

Nonverbal cues of body language and tone are especially important in cases where the content of the verbal statement is at odds with the nonverbal cues. Emotional stories told with flat affect are unlikely to work for convincing the undecided and Bernie supporters that Clinton truly cares and is actually fighting for them. Training in conveying emotions through body language and tone of voice could help Clinton in the next debate and public speaking in general.

By contrast, Trump looked like he truly cared about the economy. Right out of the gate, he spoke to the emotions of voters by expressing concerns about jobs leaving the U.S. Despite the lack of detail and his difficulty responding to questions about how he would solve this problem, his body language was angry and authoritative.

He appeared to be a strong protector to those voters, especially working-class ones who are suffering economically. He may have even appealed to those who are doing fine, but believe that the economy is headed in the wrong direction.

Trump also harshly criticized Clinton on trade deals such as NAFTA, calling it the “worst deal ever” in a strong and aggressive manner. Clinton’s calm response that Trump is “inaccurate,” without good nonverbals indicating her authentic belief that he was lying, is an example of how Trump got the best of Clinton on the nonverbals.

Overall, I would argue that while Clinton won the debate on content and substance, Trump won on style and charisma. In fact, I believe the 2 to 4 percent gain for Clinton predicted by FiveThirtyEight and other pundits in the next week will fail to materialize. Until they start taking emotional engagement into consideration, pundits will continue to be wrong about debate outcomes, and we should question their initial predictions. "
100167,1003,Donald Trump Would Be The New Female Body Shamer-In-Chief,http://www.huffingtonpost.com/bonnie-fuller/donald-trump-beware-hes-t_b_12249568.html?utm_hp_ref=politics,7,"Can we really elect a man who has repeatedly and proudly insulted the looks of women from Miss Universe to Heidi Klum? If the president is setting the example as a body-shamer, then it will be open season on every girl in school and every woman at work. You need to vote!

Words matter. Hillary Clinton pointed that out in the first presidential debate on Sept. 26, and she is so right. Words couldn’t matter more when they are uttered by the president of the United States. He or she sets the tone and the example for the entire nation.

If our next president is Donald Trump, then every woman in America needs to be prepared to be a target of body-shaming. That’s because Donald Trump has a long and unabashed history of body-shaming women for their looks, as well as insulting them in a variety of other ways.

Hillary rightly brought this up in the debate. After all, females make up 51% of the US population, which means they account for more than half of the vote. Hillary pointed out that Trump has called women “pigs,” “slobs,” “dogs,” “disgusting,” and “losers.” He was not embarrassed by her words.. In fact, he admitted that he had insulted comedienne Rosie O’Donnell for one, but he gleefully insisted that “everybody would agree that she deserves it and nobody feels bad for her.” Really? Tons of horrified debate viewers took to twitter immediately to disagree.

Neither was he embarrassed when Clinton reminded him about former Miss Universe Alicia Machado, who he called “Miss Piggy” because she gained weight after winning the title. Clinton added that he also referred to her as “Miss Housekeeping,” because she was a Latina, from Venezuela.

In fact, Trump happily called in to Fox & Friends the next morning after the debate to double down on fat shaming her again. “She was a Miss Universe person, and she was the worst we ever had - the worst, the absolute worst. She gained a massive amount of weight and it was a real problem,” he complained.

That’s right - the potential next president took time out of his busy schedule to viciously continue his body-shaming attack on Alicia Machado. Machado, by the way, says she was so traumatized by Trump’s obsession with her weight when she was Miss Universe, that she ended up in a battle with anorexia and bulimia.

“You know, with 18-year-olds, when you’re growing up, that was horrible to me,” she recounted on the Today show, on Sept. 28. “My self-esteem (was) on the floor.”

Presidents have tremendous power to set an example and if we elect one who revels in insulting women for their looks, it will normalize this same behavior by other men in workplaces, schools and online. In other words, women can expect a tidal wave of body and looks shaming to come their way under a president Donald Trump.

Beware if you’re not a “10.”

Even if you are, you can’t escape Trump’s mockery. Trump called out Heidi in August , saying, ‘ sadly, she’s no longer at 10’. Wait, what?

If even Heidi can’t measure up to Trump’s misogynist standards, what hope is there for regular women? And forget about it for women who he considers rivals.

Trump slammed GOP candidate Carly Fiorina for not being a beauty. “Look at that face, would anyone vote for that? Can you imagine that? Can you imagine that, the face of our next president,” he said in a Rolling Stone interview.

Of course, he’s slammed Hillary Clinton, herself, for not looking “presidential.” “Well, I just don’t think she has a presidential look,” he told ABC’s David Muir in early Sept. “You need a presidential look.” We can presume that Donald was doing the ultimate body shaming here - implying that Hillary couldn’t “look” presidential because she doesn’t have a penis.

Women have fought hard in the past decades to make “lookism” unacceptable in the workplace. No CEO in his right mind today would comment negatively on his female employees’ looks or bodies. In fact, they could face a lawsuit and potential job loss if they did. Yet, Donald Trump thinks he can hold the highest office in the land with his long history of lookism and his current insults. You need to think about this before you hit the voting booth on Nov 8.

Voters shouldn’t be willing to tolerate this behavior in a president when they won’t in their bosses! And the victims of Trump’s body and looks shaming include some of the most beautiful women in the country, aside from Heidi. He shamed Kim Kardashian in a 2013 interview with Howard Stern. “Does she have a good body? No. Does she have a fat ass? Absolutely. And if it weren’t Kim, they’d say ‘Wow, I don’t want to go out with her.’” Then he attacked her again when she was pregnant with North West. “ I think she’s gotten a bit large”, he complained to Showbiz Tonight.

Uh, yes- that’s what happens to women when they get pregnant, Donald!

He called former Desperate Housewives actress, Nicolette Sheridan, a “solid four,” on a scale of one to ten. “I liked the way she used to look. A person who is very flat chested is very hard to be a 10.” He even took aim at Angelina Jolie. “I don’t think she’s got a great face. I think her lips are too big, to be honest with you. They look like too big,” he told Howard Stern.

When Hillary Clinton talks about Donald Trump not having the temperament to be president, she is usually referring to his quick-to-anger temper and his impulsive decisions. But, I’d say, his loud and proud body and looks shaming of women equally demonstrate that he has not a trace of the temperament that’s needed to be president.

And talk about “trickle down.” If Donald Trump is elected as the female shamer-in-chief, his sexist attitude will continue to trickle down to tens of millions of men.

As Michelle Obama said in her speech on Sept. 28, “If a candidate regularly and flippantly makes cruel and insulting comments about women... that’s who that candidate really is.”"
100168,1003,Donald Trump’s Hall Of Insults,http://www.huffingtonpost.com/peter-dreier/donald-trumps-insult-hall_b_12246442.html?utm_hp_ref=politics,7,"It is difficult for voters to keep track of the many legal and personal scandals surrounding Donald Trump, but it is easier to remember the many people whom he has insulted. Both pose liabilities for Trump’s campaign for president, but perhaps ironically, it is the insults that are likely to do more damage than the scandals.

Supporters of Hillary Clinton seem to believe that each Trump scandal adds to voters’ negative assessment of his fitness to the president, like a snowball that gets bigger and bigger as it rolls downhill. But that doesn’t seem to be happening. Instead, each day’s scandal seems to push the previous one out of our collective memories. There are so many of them — and the details are so complicated and bizarre — that it is hard to keep track of them. The most recent scandal involves the Trump Foundation, which, according to an investigation by the Washington Post, Trump has illegal used to avoid taxes, pay business expenses, and create the misleading impression that he’s a generous philanthropist. Each day, the Post seems to find yet another way that Trump has misused the foundation to feather his nest. But no sooner have we started to understand the magnitude of Trump’s misdeeds with his foundation than we are confronted with another scandal — his illegal business dealings with Cuba during the U.S. embargo, which Newsweek just uncovered.

Trying to remember the scandals over the Trump Foundation and Cuba leaves us little room in our brains to recall the U.S. Justice Department’s lawsuit against Trump for discriminating against blacks in his apartment buildings; or the illegal con job he foisted on the unwitting “students” of his bogus Trump University; or the many employees (waiters, dishwashers, and plumbers, among others) and contractors he stiffed in his business dealings by failing to pay them for services they rendered; or the several women who have charged Trump of raping them as well as many others who have accused Trump of being a sexual predator; or the many stories that have linked Trump to the mafia in his hotel and casino business activities; or his misuse of at least four business bankruptcies to avoid paying his creditors and his taxes; or Trump’s failure to pay federal income taxes despite his wealth; or his hiring of undocumented workers for one of his real estate projects and his failure, as a federal judge found, to pay them or to provide safe working conditions, as required by law; or Trump’s repeated fines for breaking rules related to his operation of his casinos; or the Federal Trade Commission’s $750,000 fine against Trump for failing to disclose his purchases of stock in two rival casino companies, which flouted the nation’s anti-trust laws; or Trump’s misuse of his $55,000 of campaign donations to purchase copies of his book, Crippled America: How to Make America Great Again, from which he receives royalties — a violation of Federal Election Commission rules; or the foreign models who worked for Trump Model Management in this country without having proper visas and permits. And this is just a partial list!

One might think that all these scandals would lead voters to view Trump as a corrupt, irresponsible, law-breaker unfit to be president. But there are so many of them that it is difficult to keep Trump’s crimes and calumnies straight. Most of us only have a big enough attention span to remember the most recent scandal.

On the other hand, most Americans have a pretty good memory for names and faces, so it is easier to remember at least some of the long list of people whom Trump has insulted, in part because we can identify with these individuals. We are all aware of Trump’s steady use of mockery, bullying and belittlement against people with whom he disagrees, who have criticized him, or whose looks or handicaps he finds troubling.

So while Clinton’s supporters might not gain much ground reminding voters about Trump’s multiple business and personal scandals, they are on firmer ground calling attention to the people who have been targets of Trump’s demeaning insults. That’s why Hillary Clinton scored big on Monday night when she brought up Trump’s history of calling women “pigs,” “slobs,” and “dogs,” and, in particular, the insults he hurled at former Miss Universe Alicia Machado, including calling her “Miss Housekeeping” and “Miss Piggy.” Unable to let Clinton’s comments pass, Trump has spent the last few days continuing his defamation of Machado for having gained weight while she was Miss Universe. Alicia Machado

But voters might have some difficulty retrieving the specific epithets that Trump has used against people over the years. So here is a very partial list of the people he’s insulted and the words he’s used to attack them. Khizr and Ghazala Khan: After Khizr Khan — whose son Humayun, a US Army captain who was killed in Iraq and was awarded the Bronze Star Medal and the Purple Heart — gave a speech at the Democratic convention condemning Trump for his comments about Muslims and pulled out a pocket-sized copy of the Constitution to asked if Trump knew about the right to equal protection, Trump struck back. Trump not only said that Khan had “viciously attacked” him but also erroneously claimed that Khan’s wife Ghazala was not allowed to speak because she was Muslim. “She probably, maybe she wasn’t allowed to have anything to say,” Trump said on ABC News. Judge Gonzalo Curiel: Trump attacked Curiel, a judge who is presiding over a trial brought by people who were scammed by Trump University. Trump accused Curiel of having “an absolute conflict” that should prevent him from presiding over the Trump University case because Curiel, a United States citizen who was born in Indiana to immigrants from Mexico, is “of Mexican heritage.” Trump said that Curiel could not be fair because “I’m building a wall” on the U.S.-Mexican border. At a campaign rally, Trump claimed that “I have a judge who is a hater of Donald Trump, a hater. He’s a hater,” despite the fact that Curiel has ruled in favor of Trump on most of his lawyer’s requests. Trump (left) mocks disabled reporter Serge Kovaleski (right)

Serge Kovaleski: At a campaign rally, Trump he flailed his arms and mocked Kovaleski, a New York Times reporter who suffers from a chronic condition that limits the movement of his arms. Kovaleski had challenged Trump’s claim that after 9/11 Muslims in New Jersey had celebrated the attacks. Megyn Kelly: After the Fox News anchor asked Trump about his many anti-women comments over the years, Trump said: “You could see there was blood coming out of her eyes. Blood coming out of her wherever.” Carly Fiorina: “Look at that face!” Trump told a Rolling Stone reporter on his private plane when Fiorina, then his Republican rival for president, appeared on a television screen. “Would anyone vote for that? Can you imagine that, the face of our next president? Senator John McCain: At a candidate forum in Ohio, Trump mocked McCain, who spent more than five years as a prisoner in North Vietnam. “He’s a war hero because he was captured. I like people that weren’t captured, OK? I hate to tell you. He’s a war hero because he was captured, OK?” Central Park Five: In 1989 five teenage men, four African Americans and one Latino, were wrongfully convicted of raping a 28-year old white woman who was jogging in New York City. The media quickly labeled them the “Central Park Five.” As soon as they were arrested, Trump led the charge against them. He paid a reported $85,000 to take out advertising space in four of the city’s newspapers, including the New York Times, under the headline “Bring Back The Death Penalty. Bring Back The Police!” In those ads, Trump wrote: “I want to hate these muggers and murderers. They should be forced to suffer and, when they kill, they should be executed for their crimes. They must serve as examples so that others will think long and hard before committing a crime or an act of violence.” Trump’s words were hardly subtle — he was calling for the boys to die. All five boys pleaded not guilty at the trial but despite the lack of DNA evidence linking any of them to the crime scene, the jury found all five boys guilty. The judge sentenced them to serve five to 15 years in prison. Michael Warren, a respected New York civil rights lawyer who later represented the Central Park Five, said that Trump’s ads “poisoned the minds of many people who lived in New York and who, rightfully, had a natural affinity for the victim. Notwithstanding the jurors’ assertions that they could be fair and impartial, some of them or their families, who naturally have influence, had to be affected by the inflammatory rhetoric in the ads.” In 2002, Matias Reyes, a violent serial rapist and murderer serving a life sentence, confessed to the Central Park rape, stating that he had acted by himself. When the DNA evidence was re-examined, it showed that Reyes’ semen alone was found on the rape victim’s body. That year, New York’s Supreme Court vacated the convictions against each member of the Central Park Five, whose lives had been shattered by their prison terms and who, had Trump had his way, would have been given the death sentence for a crime they did not commit. Pope Francis: After the pope criticized Trump’s proposal to build a wall on the U.S.-Mexican border, Trump said that the pope’s comments were “really not very nice.” But then he went further, claiming that that the Islamic State (ISIS) wanted viewed the Vatican as its “ultimate trophy” and that the pope would “would have only wished and prayed that Donald Trump would have been president because this would not have happened.”

This list doesn’t even include Trump’s wholesale insults against Muslims, Mexicans, and Jews, or his nasty and misinformed comments about rivals Hillary Clinton, Jeb Bush, Marco Rubio, Ted Cruz, John Kasich, and others.

Trump has spread his insults so far and wide that there are few Americans who are unaware of his penchant for impulsive rants and invective against powerless and innocent people as well as against his competitors in business and politics. "
100169,1004,Clinton Hits Trump For Boasting About Not Paying His Taxes,http://talkingpointsmemo.com/livewire/clinton-trump-taxes-iowa,7,"During a Thursday rally in Des Moines, Iowa, Hillary Clinton blasted Donald Trump for bragging about ""gaming the system"" and not paying taxes.

""He spends all of his time just dumping on America,"" Clinton said. ""But then it’s probably true that he hasn’t paid a penny in federal taxes.""

Clinton mentioned Trump's refusal to release his tax returns during Monday night's first presidential debate, saying that he may be doing so because he hasn't paid federal income taxes. In response, Trump argued that not paying those taxes makes him ""smart."" He later denied saying that he has never paid federal income taxes.

""If not paying taxes makes him smart, what does that make the rest of us?"" Clinton asked the crowd in Iowa on Thursday.

The Democratic nominee also knocked Trump for rooting for the housing crisis in the hopes that he could make money off of it. She also criticized his business practices, saying that there is a ""long list of people who have been mistreated"" by Trump.

Clinton spent much of her speech talking about her plans for the economy, calling for a higher minimum wage, affordable college tuition and federal investment in child care.

Toward the end of the speech, she emphasized that she will be practicing for her next debate against Trump.

""I have no idea what he’s gonna say the next time,"" she said. ""But I will spend some time preparing for it."""
100170,1004,LA Times: Trump Wanted To Fire Hostesses Who Weren't Pretty Enough,http://talkingpointsmemo.com/livewire/trump-golf-course-fire-unattractive-women,7,"Managers at the Trump National Golf Club in Rancho Palos Verdes made sure that whenever their boss Donald Trump came to visit, only the prettiest hostesses were working, according to the LA Times.

Former employees said that under pressure from Trump, managers made sure that Trump’s clubhouse restaurant was staffed with attractive young women over more experienced employees, according to court documents cited in the article.

""I had witnessed Donald Trump tell managers many times while he was visiting the club that restaurant hostesses were 'not pretty enough' and that they should be fired and replaced with more attractive women,” Hayley Strozier, who was director of catering at the club until 2008, said in a sworn declaration.
Initially, Trump gave this command “almost every time” he visited, Strozier said. Managers eventually changed employee schedules “so that the most attractive women were scheduled to work when Mr. Trump was scheduled to be at the club,"" she said.
The LA Times used sworn court declarations found in documents from a 2012 labor relations lawsuit brought against one of Trump's development companies in Los Angeles County Superior Court.

The allegations by some employees that the workplace culture encouraged appearance-based hiring are a small part of the broader lawsuit, which centered around the lack of meal and rest breaks mandated by California law. That was largely settled in 2013. Golf course management agreed to pay $475,000 to employees who had complained about break policies, although they never admitted any wrongdoing.


Gail Doner, a middle-aged woman who worked as a server at the golf club from 2007 to 2011, wrote in her court declaration that the youngest and prettiest hostesses got the best shifts, despite their lack of restaurant experience or efficiency.

Meanwhile, Doner — who had 20 years of experience working for wine vendors, and was at “the top of [her] game” while working for Trump National — said managers slowly cut back her shifts until they stopped scheduling her at all, “effectively firing [her].”
“I chose not to fight to get my job back because by that point I was fed up with the toxic environment and the way that I was treated,” Doner wrote."
100171,1004,CNN Says Corey Lewandowski Is No Longer Being Paid By Trump Campaign,http://talkingpointsmemo.com/livewire/corey-lewandowski-no-longer-payments,7,"CNN commentator and former Donald Trump campaign manager Corey Lewandowski is no longer receiving severance payment from the campaign, the network announced Thursday.

When CNN's host Alisyn Camerota introduced Lewandowski for a segment on ""New Day,"" she prefaced his appearance with the announcement that he was no longer receiving payments from the Trump campaign.

""Now, in previous appearances we told you that Corey was still receiving severance from the Trump campaign, that is no longer the case, we are told,"" she said. ""Are you done with those payments?""

""Amazing. Everything comes to an end,"" Lewandowski joked.

""I didn't think those would ever run out,"" Camerota replied.

A Politico report released later on Thursday disclosed that Lewandowski is no longer receiving payments because the Trump campaign paid the rest of his contract in one lump sum.

""The campaign has paid the remainder of its residual contractual obligations to Mr. Lewandowski. This final payment will be noted in the next FEC report,"" Trump spokeswoman Hope Hicks, told Politico.

Lewandowski's lingering payments from the campaign had been a hot topic ever since he was hired at CNN, with many questioning whether he was able to be objective about Trump because of the payments. The Trump campaign's controversial continuing payments to Lewandowski also led to an erroneous report last week that he had been suspended from the network."
100172,1005,Will These Anti-Trump Ads Be the Killer Spots of the 2016 Campaign?,http://www.motherjones.com/politics/2016/09/will-these-anti-trump-ads-be-killer-spots-2016-campaign,7,"The Clinton campaign has released sharp ads attacking Donald Trump for his erratic temperament, his long history of misogynistic remarks, and his lack of foreign policy experience. But one of the most eviscerating ad efforts of the fall (so far) has come from a progressive outfit in Ohio, which has launched a series of spots slamming the GOP presidential nominee for having repeatedly stiffed contractors.

The effort was inspired by a June USA Today article that reported that Donald Trump has been involved in more than 3,500 lawsuits, with many of them involving contractors and individuals who claimed that Trump or his companies had not paid them for the work and services they provided. This story bolstered one of the anti-Trump themes of the 2016 campaign: that this guy is a cheapskate who screws the folks who work for him. In fact, in February, Kellyanne Conway, months before becoming Trump's campaign manager, denounced Trump on this front, saying he had ""actually built a lot of his businesses on the backs of the little guy"" and had a history of ""not paying contractors after [they've] built something"" for Trump. And at the first debate between Trump and Hillary Clinton, the Democratic nominee asked Trump, ""[Do the] people that you have stiffed over the course of your business not deserve some kind of apology from someone who has taken their labor, taken the goods that they've produced and then refused to pay them?"" Trump, replying to one case, huffed, ""Maybe he didn't do a good job, and I was unsatisfied with his work.""

This was one of the worst moments for Trump during that debate, and ProgressOhio, a liberal group, is hoping to keep this line of attack alive in perhaps the most crucial of the swing states. The organization has created several ads featuring first-person testimonials of contractors who say Trump skipped out on paying them. In one ad, a contractor hired to work at Trump's Taj Mahal casino in Atlantic City, New Jersey, maintains that Trump did not pay his small, family-run business a $232,000 bill. Due to this loss, he says, ""My dad had to lay off his own brother."" So far, the ads have only been disseminated online by ProgressOhio and two other progressive groups: MoveOn and Working America. Actor Mark Ruffalo did tweet them out to his 2.7 million followers. And now ProgressOhio is aiming to bring them to the airwaves. It plans to start by broadcasting the ads only in Toledo. If it can raise more funds, it will look to air them in other parts of the Buckeye State. No doubt, it would be happy to share these ads with other groups with the resources to place them on television in other states.

One of the best ads of the 2012 campaign focused on a worker at a factory taken over by Romney's Bain Capital who built a stage on which company execs later announced the facility was being shut down. The spot personalized a major criticism of Romney's business career. The ProgressOhio ads seek to do the same for Trump, and they target an audience that Democrats are nervous about: economically insecure, blue-collar white guys who may be susceptible to Trump's fist-pounding attacks against the elites. The point here is obvious—to show these voters that Trump is no friend of working man and women. This sort of assault was highly effective against Romney four years ago. It may well become a more prominent feature of the 2016 campaign in the weeks to come."
100173,1005,Men Are Much More Likely to Think Hillary Clinton Isn’t Healthy Enough to Be President,http://www.motherjones.com/politics/2016/09/men-are-much-more-likely-think-hillary-clinton-not-healthy-enough-be-president,7,"A new poll suggests that gender bias might account for a lot of those questions about Hillary Clinton's health.

With the exception of her recent bout of pneumonia, Clinton is apparently in fine health. She's released multiple letters from her doctor over the course of the presidential campaign, and none revealed any serious health concerns. But that didn't stop the right-wing media from continuing to suggest that Clinton had some vague—but surely deadly—health problem that should prevent her from taking the presidency. Trump himself hinted at this during Monday's debate, saying Clinton ""doesn't have the stamina"" for the job.

Apparently the perception of Clinton's health depends on whether the perceiver is a man or a woman. According to a new AP-GfK poll, there's a distinct gender gap in who is willing to buy the conspiracy theories. The poll found that 45 percent of men said they were ""only slightly or not at all confident"" in Clinton's physical fitness. Women were far less likely to think the first major-party female presidential nominee wasn't physically up to the task, with just 34 percent lacking confidence in her health. Despite the fact that Trump hasn't released as detailed a medical history, voters overall were more reassured, with 51 percent surveyed saying his health wasn't a concern."
100174,1005,So You're Freaking Out About the Latest Polls. Here Are Some Important Things to Remember.,http://www.motherjones.com/politics/2016/09/polls-election-we-voters-video,7,"Recent national polls show presidential nominees Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump locked in an increasingly tight race. That's freaking out Democrats, and allowing the Trump campaign some relief after the Republican nominee's numbers dropped significantly after the conventions.

But what are polls actually an indication of? And how do you know which poll you should trust?

What even is a poll?

Should you really be freaking out right now?

Thankfully, we've got some great experts in this new video from the We The Voters project, a new web-series about the US elections. Clare Malone and Harry Enten are senior political writers at FiveThirtyEight, the news and politics data analysis site headed by statistician Nate Silver. (Silver rose to fame after accurately predicting the outcome of 49 out of 50 states in the 2008 elections, and then all 50 states in 2012.) Using easy-to-understand analogies, Malone and Enten illustrate how polls work and what makes certain polls more representative than others.

Watch the video for a few key takeaways, but here's a pretty important one: Be aware of how polls are presented. A poll might be nonpartisan in itself, but the outlets that report them are free to deploy their own spin.

Or, the candidates themselves can self-servingly select which polls they choose to showcase. Case in point: As NPR points out, most poll numbers show that Trump didn't ""win"" Monday's presidential debate. Instead, Trump used online reader polls, which are less scientific, to boast that he did. On Tuesday, a Fox News executive reminded Fox producers that online polls ""do not meet our editorial standards,"" according to a memo obtained by Business Insider.

And of course, you shouldn't rely on just one poll. Generally, you should be looking at a number of polls to get an overall picture of how a candidate is doing—unless you want to flat-out deny reality, like this top Trump adviser: Stay tuned for more from We The Voters, a new digital, nonpartisan campaign to inform voters of key issues this election season.

100175,1006,Will: Conservatism has to come to grips with its failure — and America’s,http://hotair.com/archives/2016/09/29/will-conservatism-come-grips-failure-americas/,7,"Conservatives already dispirited over the outcome of the 2016 cycle might want to pop a Xanax before reading George Will’s latest essay on the state of the Right. The Washington Post columnist paints a dreadful, but realistic, picture of the world facing conservatives no matter the outcome of the general election in six weeks. It’s a time not for choosing as much a time for pessimism, Will writes, because conservatives have seen their party hijacked — and few people appear to care about it:

The American project was to construct a constitutional regime whose institutional architecture would guarantee the limited government implied by the Founders’ philosophy: Government is instituted to “secure” (the Declaration of Independence) preexisting natural rights. Today, however, neither the executive nor legislative branches takes this seriously, the judiciary has forsworn enforcing it, and neither political party represents it because no substantial constituency supports it.

The ease with which Trump has erased Republican conservatism matches the speed with which Republican leaders have normalized him. For the formerly conservative party, the Founders’ principles, although platitudes in the party’s catechism, have become, as former senator Daniel Patrick Moynihan said, “a kind of civic religion, avowed but not constraining.”

The beginning of conservative wisdom is recognition that there is an end to everything: Nothing lasts. If Trump wins, the GOP ends as a vehicle for conservatism. And a political idea without a political party is an orphan in an indifferent world.
This is a consequence of an eclipse within the GOP and the Right of policy in pursuit of gainsay. Over the last several years, starting with the loss of Republican majorities in Congress in 2006 but accelerating during the Barack Obama administration, the Right has seemed more interested in electoral politics than actual legislative accomplishments. Instead of using political leverage that comes with majorities to advance conservative goals through compromise, we began valuing obstruction and gridlock more.

To an extent, that was going to be inevitable. The two-year period of single-party Democrat rule from 2009-11 was a testament to progressive triumphalism, and the need to block that agenda was paramount. However, at a certain point, voters expect more return from their investment than government shutdowns and budget standoffs. The re-election of Barack Obama made it clear that voters wanted some kind of accommodation from both parties. Rather than respond to that, conservatives went right back to making promises that were impossible to keep — like claiming they could force Barack Obama to sign a repeal of ObamaCare, and shutting down the government to get it.

As I write in my column for The Week, the main proponent of no-win obstructionism has found that the monster he helped create has taken a big bite out of his hide since endorsing Trump last Friday:

The conservative movement itself has made it clear that it’s in no mood for compromise or pragmatism. Instead, over the last few years, the mood has shifted into a purity campaign that certainly fed into Cruz’s calculations. The purity campaign extended to anyone who’d ever worked across the aisle, even for conservative approaches to contentious issues.

But a funny thing happened on the way to purity. The bitter partisan stalemate resulting from purity campaigns on the right and the left created an electorate that no longer trusts in the political process. The Republican nomination came down to the ideological purist and Donald Trump, the pragmatic outsider who promised voters he’d just get things done — and Trump handily beat Cruz. Democrats nearly dumped the bare-knuckled partisan candidate of Business As Usual for a socialist backbencher in the Senate.

It’s not just the populists, either. Voters across the spectrum have tired of infighting and want solutions — and that means finding ways to work together, rather than wait for promises of victory by sheer force of will over the realities of Congressional majorities and White House control.

Perhaps Cruz, who has a brilliant mind and usually good instincts, understands that he hit the limit of purist politics. It might be that the prosaic truth of the binary choice, plus his ambitions for higher office later, necessitates pragmatism. Either way, Cruz’s endorsement acknowledges the main lesson Trump’s nomination should teach conservatives: Philosophy is not enough in politics. Voters want to see results and solutions, not just stunts. And if they can’t get either from the leaders of the governing class, they’ll go outside the system instead.
I’m a little more optimistic than Will, in this sense: America has not forgotten its founding values. It has, however, lost its patience for a movement that has declined into unseriousness, isolation, and purity battles. When conservatives start working for actual solutions in the context of political diversity, rather than refusing to take part in the process and delivering nothing while demanding that voters give them total power, then perhaps voters will take them seriously as defenders of America’s founding values. In the meantime, it’s pretty easy to see why a candidate who promises to deliver something of value managed to find support."
100176,1006,"Trump spokesman to Chuck Todd: Winning the unscientific online polls means he won the debate, man",http://hotair.com/archives/2016/09/29/trump-spokesman-chuck-todd-winning-unscientific-online-polls-means-won-debate-man/,7,"What makes the public bickering over scientific versus unscientific polls interesting isn’t the questions about methodology, it’s how it relates to the duty to tell the truth. Which political actors have a duty to tell the truth?

The public accepts (in practice if not in theory) that candidates have no duty to tell the truth. Politicians are liars, we have no expectations of integrity in them, they’re doing everything they can to win an election, so they lie. Trump can get away with touting his big wins in unscientific online polls for that reason, and also for the reason that he really might not understand the methodological differences. Someone could explain it to him, but who’s going to dare harsh his buzz about a poll he’s winning 99/1? On the other end of the spectrum, the public thinks news reporters do have a duty to tell the truth even though they violate that duty in a thousand subtle and sometimes unsubtle ways. In between are the great mass of opinionated commentators. Some of them feel their first duty is to the truth and only secondarily to the cause; some put their duty to the cause above the truth, sometimes to so great an extreme that they turn into, well, Sean Hannity.

How about Trump spokesman Jason Miller, though? What duty does he have to tell the truth about the fact that Trump has lost every scientific poll after the debate? Including this new one released within the last few hours by Gallup: Clinton won by 19 points on who was more likable, 32 points on who appeared more presidential, and 36 points on who had better command of the issues. Miller doesn’t have to acknowledge all of that, but he’s a political pro who surely does understand and agree with Todd’s point that unscientific surveys are worthless. How should he handle that?

He could have done what good spokesmen always do and moved the conversation towards more favorable ground for his client. He might have shrugged off the polls as unimportant (“there are two debates to come and the only poll that matters is on Election Day”), said that Trump did what he wanted to do by painting Clinton as the embodiment of the status quo, and pointed to the next debate as a potential gamechanger. No lies in any of that. All of it is defensible. But because, I guess, the word came down from on high today that Trump’s performance is to be defended at all costs, he’s stuck pushing this. The debate was rigged, the unscientific polls were right, all nonsense he’s forced to sell because the man-child he works for can’t concede that his unfocused preparation for the debate wasn’t so smart in hindsight.

Here’s a question. Assuming that Miller is a conservative (he was Ted Cruz’s campaign’s spokesman this year before he was Trump’s), does he have any duty to tell the truth for the good of conservatism? Ben Shapiro:

Facts Matter More Than Feelings. This principle is particularly close to my heart, for obvious reasons. I believe that facts matter. But for the last several months, with Trump fading in the polls, many Trump supporters have begun pretending that scientific polls are worthless, and unscientific polls are reliable indicators of support levels. In 2012, I took part in the “unskewing” of polls – I looked at the D+ breakdowns in polls, and then tried to rejigger the numbers based on a more even reflection of the electorate. That was an exercise in foolishness; the polls were right, and I was wrong. But now, there’s a whole new cottage industry of poll trutherism, far beyond unskewing: now we’re pretending that opt-in online polls are the equivalent of scientific polls. Why? Because we don’t like the scientific polls…

Then there are the Trumpian conspiracy theories. Since the debate, we’ve heard that Hillary Clinton used hand signals to cue Lester Holt; the Florida GOP tweeted out an Infowars story about Hillary being wired for sound. Every Trump failure has a conspiracy theory to support it, and those conspiracy stories are now being taken mainstream by some Republicans.

Truth doesn’t stop being true just because the truth is that your favored candidate is doing poorly.
Millions of people on Miller’s own side who don’t follow polls closely and don’t know whom to trust are watching garbage like this and concluding from it that unscientific polls really are as good as the real thing. They’ll carry that lesson with them after Trump’s political career is over and Miller has moved on to other clients. Whether he realizes it or not, he’s encouraging his own fellow travelers to be stupider and more poorly informed because it serves his interests short-term even though it’s poisonous to his cause long-term. And as I say, he doesn’t really have to do it. He could have deflected the question in a hundred ways. It’s one thing to have no duty to tell the truth. It’s another to have an affirmative duty to lie.

And like Max Boot said: No one forced him to take the job. "
100177,1006,Trump campaign to surrogates: Stop telling people that he lost the debate,http://hotair.com/archives/2016/09/29/trump-surrogates-stop-telling-people-lost-debate/,7,"I guess he noticed that New York Times story yesterday, huh? I don’t blame him for being annoyed that his advisors are telling the media that he needs to prepare more diligently, even if they’re going that route only because they fear he won’t absorb their advice if they tell him that privately. But that’s the question: Does Trump agree that he needs to prepare more? In other words, is he mad that his team is whispering to reporters about things that should stay in-house or is he mad because he really doesn’t believe he needs to do anything differently next week?

Team Trump denies that any of this happened, of course:

In a conference call with surrogates Wednesday afternoon, Trump aides made clear the Republican nominee is upset that his allies publicly acknowledged they pushed him to change his preparation and tactics before his next bout with Hillary Clinton. And he wants them to stop it immediately…

Trump wants his supporters to make an energetic defense of his performance and refuse to concede that he didn’t nail it…

Aides and advisers hoped Trump’s refusal to participate in traditional debate preparation sessions — instead favoring the impromptu, off-the-cuff approach that helped him through the GOP primaries — might be eased after Monday night.

One ally described Trump as the kind of guy who can’t simply be told a stove is hot — he has to touch it to see for himself.
Most of the president’s job, especially on foreign policy, involves being told by trusted aides which stoves are and aren’t too hot to touch. If President Trump’s going to insist on touching all of them to find out for himself, hoo boy.

His campaign staff has, allegedly, delivered the message “gingerly” that he needs to be more disciplined next time, but there’s an interesting argument internally over that. One source claims that his advisors keep telling him that “letting Trump be Trump” won’t bring in new voters. The new, more disciplined Trump 2.0 was built to convince white college grads who have been skittish about him to give him a second look, and it seems to be working. If he’s back to Trump 1.0 at the debates, those voters might write him off entirely and then he’s stuck at 40-42 percent nationally without an obvious way to build on it. Trump’s counter, though, according to CNN’s source is that “his approach is what his base likes” — which is true, and which would be a better play at this point if Team Trump concludes that he’s done about as much as he can to persuade persuadables that he’s presidential timber. He might be better off going Full Metal Trump for the last month and seeing if it inspires his white working-class base to turn out in record numbers.

Playing for swing voters seems like the wiser course between the two since it’d be relatively easy for Trump to behave “presidentially” over the next two debates — study hard, don’t get baited, stick to your message that Clinton’s the status quo personified — and very hard to turn out millions of extra downscale white voters, especially without much of a ground game. Also, if Trump is all about pleasing his base then what was the point of the brief “softening” on immigration and the outreach to minority voters this past month? He would have been better off in white neighborhoods pounding the table about mass deportation. He wants to be the populist Mr Hyde but his campaign keeps shoving him towards being a more traditional Dr Jekyll, which is why you get these odd fluctuations in which audience he seems to be pandering to at any given time.

His post-debate numbers are holding steady in the LA Times tracking poll, by the way. There’s been no bounce for Hillary in that survey yet. YouGov, however, sees something positive for Clinton and negative for Trump: Any question in any poll that involves better numbers for her than for him among Republicans is a problem. YouGov also asked all voters if the debate improved or worsened their opinion of each candidate. Clinton split 41/36; Trump split … 29/47, with 20 percent of his own party saying their opinion of him worsened versus just six percent of Democrats who said that about Clinton. That’s why his team is leaning on him to buckle down for the next one. Another bad debate might cement the impression that Trump isn’t up to the job, assuming the first one hasn’t already.

Exit quotation from the man himself: “I’m winning all of these [online] polls, hundred of thousand of votes… I have to sit back and you have to sit back and hear these polls don’t mean anything.”"
100178,1007,"Former Clinton White House Staffer RETURNS, Exposes “Beyond Chilling” Truth That Hillary Will Hate",http://www.youngcons.com/former-clinton-white-house-staffer-returns-exposes-beyond-chilling-truth-that-hillary-will-hate/,7,"Hillary Clinton has a lot of baggage.

Unfortunately for her, so does her husband.

I saw someone on Facebook the other day claiming that no one has ever accused Bill Clinton of rape.

That’s very false.

Many women have accused Bill Clinton of sexual misconduct in one form or another.

One of those women was Monica Lewinsky.  Monica’s friend Linda Tripp was a key part of that scandal. Linda sat down for an interview recently that has to be driving Hillary and the mainstream media nuts thanks to some new details that were provided about Hillary’s competence.

From Conservative Tribune: Tripp recently took part in a lengthy interview with Breitbart reporter Aaron Klein, during which she recalled many of the various Clinton scandals that unsurprisingly seemed to foreshadow some of the Clinton’s more recent scandalous behavior.

She opened up about what she had seen regarding the aftermath of Vince Foster’s death, as well as Travelgate, Filegate and the Whitewater scandal, with one common theme seemingly connecting them all together — a lax attitude on the part of the Clintons regarding classified information and security issues.


Tripp began her career in the George H.W. Bush White House, which she noted followed strict protocols regarding security and the handling of classified material. That changed when the Clintons arrived, as they had a “cavalier, loosey-goosey, this isn’t important, don’t be a prude” attitude toward handling sensitive materials.

“Because I would often bring up the fact that this had to happen. That this was not a luxury. This was a necessity. And classified material is just part and parcel of working in the West Wing of the White House on a daily basis,” she explained. “So there was sort of a disregard for any of the rules. They certainly didn’t apply to them. And that was startling.”

One example Tripp shared was the process by which individuals working in the White House would gain security clearances, which typically was an arduous process that took upward of 90 days to complete before the individual could begin working.

She further recalled that even then Hillary Clinton’s top aide Cheryl Mills was instrumental in many of the scandals, seemingly always there to clean up any messes and protect Clinton, something that apparently has continued even to this day.

All of what Tripp recalled seemed to connect seamlessly to today, as the Clintons remain surrounded by scandals only of a different name now.

“The Clinton’s embody a culture of corruption,” Tripp said.

Not exactly good news for Hillary.

Things just seem to get worse and worse for her every day. "

Obama’s Justice Department could have easily prosecuted her.

But, they decided to make up their own interpretation of the law to protect her.

However, Trey Gowdy is urging people not to give up.

There is still a glimmer of hope for people who want to get rid of this Justice Department.

Here’s Christian Datoc with more… From The Daily Caller:

During a Thursday morning interview on Fox News, Congressman Trey Gowdy stated that there is still a chance Hillary Clinton’s email server could come back to haunt her. Gowdy told host Bill Hemmer that if American voters “vigorously disagree” with the decision not to prosecute Clinton or any members of her State Department staff, they can simply vote in a new Justice Department in November.

“It is dead in the water other than what I said in the past,” the South Carolina Republican continued. “There are multiple groups in our culture that provide oversight. There is the executive branch, there’s Congress, there’s you in the media, but on November 8th, the real jury gets to weigh in, and if they think this Department of Justice has been politicized, they are welcome to replace it with another Department of Justice.” He brings up a good point.

Unhappy with this current administration and the way they handled Hillary’s emails?

Make your voice heard on November 8th and we can get a new one.

Then, maybe someone can actually hold her accountable.

Here’s the video.

Apparently, there are a lot of people out there not buying the liberal narrative that he lost the debate to Hillary.

Today, Hillary was in Iowa for a rally.

How many people showed up?

About 600.

You didn’t hear much about the attendance from the mainstream media. She said some pretty ridiculous stuff.

Including a strange commentary on the 2016 race. From Breitbart:

“It breaks my heart to see all the mean spirited, divisive, bigoted things that are being said in our country,” she said, placing her hand on her chest during a rally on Thursday afternoon. Clinton opened up her rally proclaiming that she wanted her campaign to be “about something, not just against somebody” and tried to spark a positive tone in the rally.

“We can have our differences for heaven’s sakes, we’re Americans, that’s in our DNA,” she said, calling for everyone to “listen to one another” going forward.

Clinton warmly told the crowd long stories about her parents, but her attempt to signal a bright new future quickly turned nasty.

“He spends all of his time just dumping on America,” she said, referring to Trump.

A lot of nonsense to unpack there.

First of all, Trump doesn’t “dump on America”.  He dumps on the Democrats who have been screwing up America for 8 years.

Also, you don’t get to make up false narratives about Trump supporting the KKK and then sit back and complain about how divisive the race is.

This is the woman who called Trump supporters “deplorable”.

Absolutely delusional. "
100181,1008,Trump Is Better Positioned for the Next Two Debates Than the Pundits Dare Realize,http://www.americanthinker.com/articles/2016/09/trump_is_better_positioned_for_the_next_two_debates_than_the_pundits_dare_realize.html,7,"In the first presidential debate Donald Trump achieved Job One: convincing independents that he is being mischaracterized and caricatured, that he really is a “normal” guy, just exuberant but essentially normal, under control, disciplined.  To the point that he is a plausible choice.  I believe that at the suggestion of his handlers he drank water whenever he felt the urge to interrupt or insult or felt himself “losing it.”  (The irony, of course, is that he mocked Marco Rubio for drinking lots of water during debates.  But, as with “All Things Trump,” the alternative is Hillary.  So drink away!)

It seemed kind-of a draw.  I wanted him to hit her harder on the emails, the Clinton Foundation, the speaking fees, her 25 years of public scandals, even how she lied about her name.  But his most important job was to seem Presidential, no matter what, to seem plausible.  In that, he succeeded, much as he benefited when he shared a stage and podium with the Mexican President, with marble walls behind them as two world leaders. He was sharing the stage, split-screen with the Secretary of State, the Democrats’ candidate for President, and he managed to emerge plausible.  Despite the hundreds of millions spent on calling him a monster, the mere sight of him in a one-on-one with Hillary Clinton legitimized him for Independents as a real candidate.  In that sense, he won a split decision narrowly.

I was enormously put off, disgusted, by her constant false laughing and broad toothy smiling, as though she perceived Trump to be the funniest buffoon, just so comical that you honestly could not help laughing.  Well, he was fine, was serious, and there was nothing to laugh at — reflecting that her laugh and toothy smile is phony, now and always.

Lester Holt was profoundly one-sided.  He interrupted Trump constantly (41 times), rarely Hillary (7 times).  He tried a few Candy Crowley moments, as when he interjected his views on the constitutionality of stop-and-frisk.  That is Hillary’s job, if she wishes to interject along those lines, not the moderator’s.  He asked Trump five hard follow-up questions; he asked Hillary . . . not one.  However, whereas moderators like Crowley cowed Romney and McCain into submission, because those genteel nominees were oh-so-polite and well mannered, Trump was not cowed.  When Holt corrected Trump, Trump stood his ground and re-stated his positions in contradiction to Holt.  When Holt tried to cut him off, Trump gently continued talking.  It is not elegant to stand up to bias, and maybe Frank Luntz’s sample viewers dialed back their devices, but the alternative to standing up is getting crushed, as Crowley did to Romney.

Because Holt was so predictably biased, I have no problem with Trump refusing to answer certain questions and instead answering his own questions.  It was a shame that Trump got baited into defending extensively on his taxes and the birther stuff.  If I were he, on taxes I would have said: “Lester, you get the IRS to stop its audit.  Or, better — Hillary, you get Koskinen to stop the audit, and then I will release taxes.  Meanwhile, Lester, when tonight are you going to ask her to release her 33,000 deleted emails?  And when are you going to ask her to release the transcripts of those secret Wall Street speeches where they paid her $225,000 for each 15-minuite speech?” 

As to the Birther issue: “Lester, the whole thing was spread by Hillary Clinton’s veteran henchman Sidney Blumenthal.  Here, Lester — I just happen to have with me a copy of the news item where the guy from the McClatchy newspapers tells how he was pressed by Mister Blumenthal to send a reporter to Kenya to check out where Obama was born.  In fact, I have a second copy of the article, which I would appreciate, Lester, if you can hand to Hillary.  And, speaking of Hillary’s close advisor Sidney Blumenthal, when are you going to ask Hillary about Sidney Blumenthal’s private emails to her on her unsecure private server?  And since he was advising her on Benghazi, Lester, when are you going to ask Hillary about Benghazi and about Sidney Blumenthal’s role in secretly advising her while he was on the payroll of the Clinton Foundation.  And, oh yeah, Lester, when are you going to ask her about the Clinton Foundation and how it took money from regimes that oppress women and murder gays, and how she gave special treatment as Secretary of State to donors to the Clinton Foundation?”  Then, if Holt returned to follow up on the Birther issue, I just would have kept repeating the retort above

Hillary’s mouth got drier and drier as the debate progressed.  That means that, despite her laughing and toothy smiling, she was more stressed and anxious than she showed.  You could hear it.

I do not believe most non-Democrats give a hoot about Trump’s taxes, or what he is worth, or who he has stiffed in business, or what he gives in charity.  We just want to know what he will do to protect the homeland, improve the economy, and secure the federal judiciary, from the Supreme Court to the federal appellate circuits down to the district courts.  The taxes and Birther stuff is a real sideshow that fascinates the media and the Dems but means nothing.  Moreover, if Trump really is under such an audit — and we do not care — then he should not release taxes.  Any tax release would lead the media to poke around and embarrass the auditors into chasing down every single possible point of contention, including things they otherwise would not bother with and taking a hard line with Blumenthal on every single point of dispute, lest they be accused of going soft on him.  He should just keep coming back with: “You release the 33,000 emails, and the Wall Street speeches, and get the IRS to stop hounding me and end the audit, and I will release the taxes.”

Final thought.  Obviously, I am voting for Trump.  Anyone But Clinton.  So I am the prisoner of my vantage point.  But here is what I see:  If he had won the first debate, Trump’s megalomania would have gone through the roof, and he would be back to gloating and making incredibly damaging comments and getting into silly fights with people beneath him.  He would walk into the next debate with no prep, and — to use his term (which every Brooklyn boy used in my teen years when describing a baseball game when our team lost by a lot) — he would get schlongged next time.  And it would be a disaster.

Instead, he stood his ground nicely.  She called him names — “racist,” “crazy,” “in his own reality” — and he behaved himself.  He interrupted no more than does Bernie Sanders or than does any other New Yorker interrupt others who are speaking.  This was not a GOP primary debate.  He was pretty much a plausible President.  Yet he knows, and his team knows, that he missed many chances, faced a terribly biased moderator, let her squirm out of some corners — and somehow let the night go by without deeper talk of Benghazi, the martyred families, “What difference does it make?” the Clinton Foundation, the Wall Street speeches, the $225,000 fifteen-minute speeches, the way they left the White House “broke” (except for the furniture they stole) and soon became hundred-millionaires without ever building a thing they can point to.  So he now has a chance to mull over what was, what could have been — and what yet can be.

Meanwhile, never underestimate the egomania and arrogance of Herself.  Hillary is as crazy-in-love-with-self as he is, and she is surrounded by the same kind of sycophants that he has.  Now she goes home, even more sure that she has it all locked up, and that he is an idiot.  John Kerry did that after his first debate with “W” and it showed in the second, when “W” was on his game.  If she comes in next time, like some kind of Rhonda Rousey expecting to win in thirty seconds, or like last year’s St. Louis Cardinals, convinced that she in invincible, she may just end up like Rhonda Rousey or last year’s Cardinals.

I think that is a possibility.  Trump has a great shot at being better next time, and he again benefits from entering the second debate with a lower bar of expectations.  By the third debate, he not only will have gained experience but also will have Chris Wallace moderating.  Wallace will not be Trump’s friend at that debate, not by a long shot, but Wallace will be fair and will demand the same of Hillary that he demands of Trump.  She is not used to that, and she won’t have a fourth debate to recover from being treated the way an honest journalist should treat her.

100182,1008,Does the Present Culture of Uncertainty Favor Trump?,http://www.americanthinker.com/articles/2016/09/does_the_present_culture_of_uncertainty_favor_trump.html,7,"You don’t have to travel very far outside the Beltway to encounter a lot of folks who feel like that “these are the worst of times” –– if not “worst,” then very much in the running.

Some 70 to 80 percent of Americans believe that the country is heading in the wrong direction and there is plenty of evidence to support their thinking. In spite of the President and Mrs. Clinton’s rosy utopianism, millions of Americans are worse off financially now than they were 8 years ago. Seniors have seen their incomes dwindle frighteningly as interest rates earned on CD’s and savings accounts have shrunk to less than 1 percent, working Americans’ wages stagnated years ago, unemployment figures –– including people who’ve given up on finding work – are intolerable, Millennials, especially, face a very uncertain future with unemployment hitting their generation especially hard. Everyone faces rising prices in the most obvious place for ordinary folks: the grocery store, particularly when it comes to the cost of meat which has been driven up by the cost of grain due to the government’s ethanol mandate. Taxes and regulations are squeezing out jobs-producing small businesses (In 1994, small businesses less than 1 year old created 4.1 million jobs but only 3 million in 2015) eliminating non-essentials out of the family budgets of Americans.

Culturally, corruption is pervasive –– in politics, certainly, but also in popular culture where even the Super Bowl entertainment and televised media award shows –– staples of family entertainment –– are vulgar and trashy. The environment? Everywhere you look the streets and highways are littered with trash. We cannot be assured of our safety shopping in our malls, worshipping in our churches or putting in our day’s work at the office. Public services are overextended; we can’t even talk to a real person on the customer service lines of businesses. Our police departments say the shortage of applicants willing to face today’s challenges and crises threatens public safety even more.

In his recent comments in First Things’ Public Square, R. R. Reno put things into perspective. Reno wrote about the vulnerability of twenty-first century America. That vulnerability goes far beyond the natural human reality of “finitude, which means knowing that one may have to endure setbacks, illnesses, and disappointments.” Today’s vulnerability, he wrote, is a “pervasive disquietude [that] is transforming our society and politics.” Our Millennials, especially, he believes experience the undermining of “the credibility of the past [that] deprives them of a cultural inheritance that they feel they can trust. Without confidence that the past provides secure anchors and reliable patterns of life, they feel isolated” and cannot “trust inherited wisdom and patterns of life to guide” them on their way.

The Millennial world and, increasingly, the general culture, consists of “a horizon of freedom [that] is also a horizon of possible missteps, failures, and wounds.” Thus, speech must be censured, “safe spaces” and “trigger warnings” provided. Campuses must also set out clearly a procedure by which any relationship between the sexes can only proceed through a series of verbal “yes” or “no” responses. No wonder guys have quit asking girls out on dates. In world of meaningless sex, it is no wonder that marriage rates are declining and loneliness is now recognized as a major national problem. Plus, social scientists are increasingly concerned about the denigration of masculinity.

Reno recognizes the importance of religion as a powerful influence on social stability, permanence and policy. Of course, the left knows this, thus the pervasive religious liberty and freedom of speech battles today. Reno’s major point in this regard is, “without a trustworthy Father in heaven (and often without a father in the home), the rising generation is more and more likely to ask big government (and a culture of political correctness) to provide security and comfort.” Nothing is more insecure or uncomfortable than today’s public schools and college campuses where, Reno says, “inclusion” is not working very well and, in fact in many places, are “largely dysfunctional.”

All of this uncertainty and vulnerability in very disparate sections of the society, is producing cultural “earthquakes.” The end result is that the upper elites and those on government dole are the winners. The losers are the middle-class who’ve “seen no income growth in the last few decades.” They’ve lost financially and culturally. Their Judeo-Christian values and mores have been trashed, and their patriotism and faith are derided and belittled. Even in their own country, they are strangers in an increasingly strange and hostile land.

The pervasive sense of uncertainty and disorientation has erupted in ways that are bewildering many if not most of the candidates for office in this election season as it has resulted in nullifying their old tried and true techniques of persuading the public. President Obama, the first Black President, has exacerbated racial tensions to the disbelief and puzzlement of many who thought he would help bring healing and mark the end of the racial divide. Now, racial polarization is widespread; according to the media, only “Black Lives Matter” and the prevailing narrative is that “white people” with their privilege are the enemy. President Obama even spoke derisively of the grandmother who raised him as “a typical white person.” Religious people were stereotyped and marginalized as “bitter clingers.” While laser-like in his focus on any suspected hint of hidden racism among the people of this country, he refuses to even call terrorists, “Islamic terrorists” even though all have been radical jihadists. Speaking in Laos, he caricatured Americans as typically lazy and uninformed.

Democrat candidate, Hillary Clinton, the first female candidate of a major party for President, is so corrupt and takes such extreme radical leftist positions that even many of those who would celebrate breaking the “glass ceiling” oppose her candidacy. Hillary has written off those opposed to her candidacy as “deplorable” and described them in mean-spirited stereotypes because she views all those who are unwilling to get on her bandwagon as “irredeemable.” (Well-read Americans have observed how frequently those “on the Hillary bandwagon” are just one small misstep from being thrown “under the Hillary bus.”) As though she were the Pope, she has declared Americans’ “deep-seated religious beliefs have to change.” Contrary to the Democratic Party’s historic alignment with 9-to-5 wage earners, Hillary’s obvious disparagement of the working class is particularly off-putting to those working class men and women who are out-of-work.

During the Obama Administration, according to National Review data [TL1] on Black America: labor-force participation went down 2.1 percent; food stamp participants increased 58.2 percent, home ownership dropped 9.5 percent and real median income declined 1.5 percent. Those are disastrous figures making uncertainty and vulnerability pervasive through the middle class, Millennials and Senior Citizens.

In the face of all these facts, why would Mrs. Clinton shrilly ask in a recent speech, “Why am I not 50 points ahead?” It’s actually surprising that the race is close at all.

Donald Trump is a different political candidate. In many respects he is an unknown even though he’s been in the public eye his whole life and his every fault and failure is well known. Nevertheless, in spite of so much negative press, Donald Trump is gaining on Hillary. It’s a measure of how desperately Americans want change and a restoration of Constitutional governance.

Working Americans respond positively when he says he wants to “Make America Great Again.” Main Street Americans want someone who respects the values of hard-work, faith, family, and patriotism, not someone who will give the nation 4 more years like the last 8 wretched, discouraging years of race-mongering and corruption that we’ve had to endure without a Justice Department, Homeland Security, Internal Revenue Service, State Department, Federal Bureau of Investigation or White House we can trust.

Many Americans are hungry, even desperate, to see a restoration of our basic freedoms – religious liberty, freedom of speech, respect for life and opportunities for all to reach their full potential. We wait anxiously to see if we are an emerging majority and if this once great nation of ours can be put back on the right track toward a hopeful future.

100183,1008,Washington’s Short Termism,http://www.americanthinker.com/articles/2016/09/washingtons_short_termism.html,7,"In the Wall Street Journal Vice President Joe Biden comments on ""How Short-Termism Saps the Economy"". He mirrors similar criticisms from the Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton. They complain that corporate incentive systems are oriented to the short term to the detriment of the long-term best interest of the companies they lead. Shareholders and the economy ultimately suffer. Apparently Biden and Clinton are more reflective of the shareholders’ wishes than the boards they elect.

Biden confesses that the Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1993 put a limit on cash pay to executives in an attempt to link executive pay to performance, and now criticizes incentive pay oriented toward the short term. The best long-term incentive is to simply own the stock.

Incentives that are tied to short-term shareholder wealth, rather than increasing the asset or market based long-term value of the company, tend to use securities market and financial maneuvers. This is part of the reason for the high level of stock buybacks that are propelling the market and causing Biden some heartburn. This is a problem with laws and regulations trying to nudge behavior without understanding the dynamics of the system.

But there are other reasons for the recent buyback activity. The combination of low interest rates and rapidly accumulating fiscal friction costs makes the buyback activity a rational deployment of resources that is in the best interest of the shareholders. The ACA and the Dodd-Frank bill, with years passing from its enactment to clarification, leave the costs of new investment uncertain. New regulations and the threat of executive orders bypassing legislation make long-term capital commitments risky. Will they find a way to impose the card check bill even after it was rejected in Congress?  

Hillary’s campaign proposes a seven-layer array of capital gains taxes, but no matter how often taxes on the wealthy are raised, there is an immediate call to pay more. Their fair share is never articulated, but it is always higher than the current rate. Raising the estate tax as she has proposed is not an incentive for the wealthy to make long-term investments while sacrificing current consumption.

Even a targeted tax cut may have little impact because of the lack of faith that it will remain in place long enough to merit the investment risk. George W. Bush’s tax cut had an expiration date. When the Democrats took the House in 2006 and everything else in 2008 few felt it would remain in place past the expiration.

Executive compensation among the largest companies can appear to be excessive, but the solution to this is not government moral preening and micromanagement, but competition. The hyper-regulation following the recent crash, however, serves to cement the position of established companies and to limit startups and new competition.

Inflation is most pronounced in the parts of the economy with the most government regulation, as Kevin Williamson at National Review wrote in his illuminating article, ""Sneaky Inflation"". The largest companies have come to see greater returns from the rent-seeking ties to government than by investment in job producing and economy growing capital investment. Rent seeking and hyper-regulation induces short-term behavior.

If such short termism is truly to the disadvantage to the shareholders, then there should be other companies taking the long-term view attracting capital from those unhappy shareholders. There is certainly a competitive market for capital. The reason that there is an emphasis on returning profits to shareholders is that there are too few opportunities for capital investment in an economy subject to ever increasing friction costs, fiscal uncertainty, and social justice warriors whose preferred tax policy is ‘never enough’. Investors would rather see profits reinvested and grow than returned, although there is some demand for a return to compensate for the near zero interest rates on traditional yield instruments.

If there is a problem with short termism it is in government, with the proliferation of three-thousand-page bills, endless regulations from unaccountable and uncontrollable agencies, rent-seeking cronies, executive unilateralism, and various forms of legal shakedowns.

If Joe Biden wants corporate America to take a long term view of business growth perhaps he should start by asking his boss and Congress to do the same.

100184,1009,TRUMP’S OFF-MESSAGE DETOUR CONTINUES,http://www.powerlineblog.com/archives/2016/09/trumps-off-message-detour-continues.php,7,"The Democrats are doing their best to distract voters from the serious issues in this year’s campaign. Donald Trump, sadly, continues to enable them. The Associated Press reports that Trump is now obsessing on Bill Clinton’s infidelities:

“An impeachment for lying,” Trump said Thursday at a campaign rally in New Hampshire, referring to the effort to remove Bill Clinton from office for lying about his affair with White House intern Monica Lewinsky. “Remember that? Impeach.”

The Republican nominee’s decision to dredge up the former president’s sexual history is a risky move in his campaign against Democrat Hillary Clinton, whose own team isn’t fazed by the attack line.

Well, no. What they fear is discussion of immigration, the economy and terrorism.

Trump critics say it all could backfire, elevating Clinton in the eyes of female voters and motivating her base.

“The whole notion of trying to get Hillary Clinton to pay for Bill Clinton’s infidelities is just strategically a bad choice,” said Katie Packer, a longtime Republican strategist opposed to Trump’s candidacy. Women in particular, she said, see it as cruel.

Republican pollster Frank Luntz said Trump’s reference to Bill Clinton’s indiscretions was his low point Monday night among the group of voters with whom he watched the debate.

Of course, the issue isn’t infidelities or indiscretions, it is rape and sexual harassment. Also, perhaps, the Lolita Express, although Trump hasn’t brought that up. But all of this makes sense only in the context of Hillary’s role as an accessory after the fact.

Trump first touched on Bill Clinton’s sexual past the weekend before the debate, threatening to seat Gennifer Flowers in the front row. She has said she and Clinton had an affair and he has admitted to one sexual encounter.

Is that last assertion true? I don’t recall that Bill Clinton denied the twelve-year affair that was alleged by Flowers. Didn’t Bill and Hillary jointly admit that Flowers was telling the truth in a nationally televised interview?

But that is a minor point. Ironically, the most pertinent comment comes from Hillary’s campaign team.

While Hillary Clinton’s aides aren’t thrilled about having her marriage back in the spotlight, they argue Trump’s new focus prevents him from making an affirmative case for his candidacy and only underscores the concerns some voters have with his temperament.

Exactly. When Trump is talking about Paula Jones and Monica Lewinsky, he isn’t talking about the economy, or immigration, or crime, or terrorism. I think one can speculate safely that the Democrats can hardly believe their good fortune.

Donald Trump needs to get back on message, or he is going to lose."
100185,1009,"LIVE FROM COUNCIL BLUFFS, TRUMP ON THE STUMP",http://www.powerlineblog.com/archives/2016/09/live-from-council-bluffs-trump-on-the-stump.php,7,"Nebraska attorney Dave Begley returned to his stomping grounds in Council Bluffs to file another of his reports on the appearances of the presidential candidates. Here he gives us Trump on the stump yesterday (full event video below). Dave writes:

The freewheelin’ Donald Trump is a thing of the past as he spoke on Wednesday using the TelePrompter. The speech was more structured but it needed some editing. The main point of the event – before a full room of over 1,000 – was to rally the troops and get out the vote. The speech had two main points: attack Madam Hillary and revisit the things that Trump will accomplish as an agent of change.

Trump hit Hillary very hard. Hillary is the insider fighting for her donors. Trump will fight for you. Her only real success in 26 years was in making herself rich; $100 million in donations from Wall Street along with $4.1 million in speaking fees. Follow the money. The office of Secretary of State was sold. Checks were written and favors granted. Special interests own Hillary. They get what they want to serve their globalist agenda but we – the American people – don’t get what we want.

On the email cover-up Trump noted that 33,000 emails were deleted and “bleached” after they were subpoenaed by Congress. Her phones were destroyed by hammers and her aides took the Fifth and were granted immunity by the FBI as in Mafia cases. He noted that her greatest achievement is getting away with her email scheme and subsequent cover-up.

Trump asked how many more Clinton scandals this country can survive. His call to end Clinton corruption brought wild cheers. Do we need Clinton drama – on multiple fronts – for the next four years?

He noted that her campaign is unserious. Clinton’s invocation of something to do with Miss Universe twenty years ago only proves Trump’s point. The leader of the Free World should be decided on something more substantive than that frivolity, but that’s what Hillary has. The woman card: deal me in.

Looking back at Monday’s debate, Trump asserted that he won. Maybe he did, but he really needs to practice. The fact-checkers might even agree with Trump that Madam Hillary failed in Iraq, Iran, Syria, Libya, Russia, China and North Korea. I note that 450,000 are presumed dead in Syria (that’s roughly equivalent to Omaha’s population) and millions have been displaced in the Middle East in the greatest humanitarian crisis since World War II. And this woman has the right experience for a promotion? As Trump has said, Hillary has experience but it is all bad.

As the change agent, Trump ticked off the things he will accomplish. I note that he has the capacity to do them as the GOP will control Congress. Hillary won’t be able to pass her legislation. We will get gridlock and extra-constitutional executive actions from her. You know his items: build a wall, end sanctuary cities, lower taxes, better trade deals, repeal Obamacare, repeal Common Core, school choice, cut regulations, kill the Green agenda, promote American energy, build infrastructure and appoint conservatives to the Supreme Court.

It appears to me that Trump is targeting the industrial midwest and Council Bluffs certainly fits that profile. The crowd was very much blue collar and this is where the election will be won if it is won. After Iowa, the hardest working man in politics left for the great north woods of Wisconsin for another rally. Trump said he will fight “for every neglected part of this country.”

His only guest on stage was the mother of Sarah Root. This young woman was killed by an drunk illegal alien in Omaha the day after she graduated from college with highest honors. The illegal alien bailed out of jail and is gone. In a surprising twist I spoke with a woman from Lincoln, Nebraska, who had a family member or friend – in the late ’90’s – raped at the Cornhusker Hotel. This foreigner had crossed the line numerous times but he returned to rape in downtown Lincoln. He is now in the Nebraska Penitentiary and is soon to be released, but my question is how he will fare in a Hillary Clinton administration.

Rudy Guilani introduced Trump (his introduction is included in the video below). He challenged the notion that Trump is somehow friendly with Putin. Drawing on his experience putting the Mafia away, the former United States Attorney stated: “If you cave in to them, they take advantage of you.” Barack Obama and Hillary Clinton drew a line in Syria and it was crossed. Now Russia runs wild."
100186,1009,GOWDY STRIKES A NERVE,http://www.powerlineblog.com/archives/2016/09/gowdy-strikes-a-nerve.php,7,"When FBI Director James Comey appeared before the House Judiciary Committee yesterday, the GOP members grilled him about his handling and disposition of the Clinton email investigation. As former prosecutors, several members drew on their experience working with the FBI to point out the apparent anomalies that have come to light, including the various immunity deals that went roughly nowhere. (Paul Sperry provides a useful summary in the New York Post this morning.)

Rep. Trey Gowdy highlighted the anomalies in a way that drew the obvious ire of Comey (video below). Gowdy is particularly effective outlining the circumstantial evidence that belies Comey’s recommendation of no prosecution. “False exculpatory statements are gold in a courtroom,” Gowdy says, and then itemizes a few of Clinton’s most notable lies. Gowdy then sums up the lameness of Comey’s rationale for declining to recommend any prosecution.

In the final minute of the video, Gowdy pays an emotional tribute to the FBI based on his experience. He draws a contrast between the FBI he worked with and the one that is visible in the apparent anomalies in the FBI’s investigation of the Clinton case. “That is not the FBI that I used to work with,” Gowdy says.

Gowdy struck a nerve. Dropping his mask of impassivity, Comey indignantly responds: “I hope someday when this political craziness is over you will look back again on this because this is the FBI you know and love. This was done by pros in the right way. That’s the part I have no patience for.”

Well, I know the feeling, but that’s not exactly a defense on the merits to how “funny” things look or to the substance of Gowdy’s critique. It’s a substitute for an argument. "
100187,1010,The Trump campaign has very important opinions about what size women are allowed to be,https://thinkprogress.org/the-trump-campaign-has-very-important-opinions-about-what-size-women-are-allowed-to-be-c1cae79daf9a#.p847lnohi,7,"Just over a month before the presidential election, the Trump campaign is doggedly focused on what size they believe women’s bodies should be.
Despite backlash in the press_—_a round of headlines this week pointed out that the current news cycle isn’t doing Donald Trump any favors with female voters_—_the GOP presidential nominee and his surrogates won’t stop talking about Alicia Machado, a former Miss Universe winner who was publicly shamed for gaining weight after she won the crown in 1996.
It’s just the latest high-profile example of Trump making offensive comments about women’s weight, examples of which are littered throughout the past several decades.
Back in 1996, mainstream news outlets reported that Machado gained weight after “indulging a passion for pasta and cake.” Donald Trump required her to exercise publicly in front of the media in order to keep her crown.
And after Hillary Clinton took the opportunity during Monday’s presidential debate to reference Trump’s treatment of Machado, noting he once called her “Miss Piggy,” the campaign hasn’t been able to let it drop. Tuesday morning, Trump kept talking about Machado’s weight during an appearance on Fox News, saying she “gained a massive amount of weight” and it was a “real problem” for the Miss Universe pageant. Wednesday evening, he discussed it again with Bill O’Reilly, saying he did the right thing by saving Machado’s job after she “put on so much weight” and she “knew what she was getting into” by entering a beauty contest.
Trump surrogates got in on the game, too. On Wednesday evening, Newt Gingrich defended Trump, telling a room full of people at a Log Cabin Republicans event that “you’re not supposed to gain 60 pounds during the year that you’re Miss Universe.”
It’s unclear what makes Trump and Gingrich qualified to discuss what constitutes an appropriate weight for individual women. While BMI is a wholly imperfect measure of health, Trump’s current height and weight_—_which he revealed earlier this month on the Dr. Oz Show_—_technically mean the candidate could be considered clinically overweight.
Regardless, this hardly an isolated incident. Trump has a long history of making disparaging comments about women’s bodies.
Machado isn’t the only Miss Universe contestant who says Trump suggested she was fat. “He was calling some girls some pretty horrible names as well,” Jodie Seal, who competed as Miss Australia the same year that Machado took home the crown, told Inside Edition. “He said to me, ‘suck your stomach in. Suck your gut in.’ He always wanted us to be sexy.”
And, as the Washington Post detailed in a piece published on Wednesday, there are plenty of other examples that reveal Trump’s attitude toward women who apparently weigh more than he deems they should.
Trump called actress Rosie O’Donnell a “fat pig” and said she has a “fat, ugly face.” He said singer Jennifer Lopez has a “fat a_—_” and said reality television star Kim Kardashian had “gotten a little large” during her pregnancy. He kept a “fat photo” of one employee whose weight fluctuated in a drawer and told an overweight executive, “you like your candy,” according to the employees. When a reporter complimented his wife, Melania, on her appearance shortly after giving birth, Donald Trump replied: “She’s lost almost all the baby weight.”
In addition to making comments comparing women to pigs and dogs, Trump has sent other signals that communicate he’s comfortable with dehumanizing women. Once, during an 2005 interview with Howard Stern, Trump rated celebrity women’s level of attractiveness on a scale of 0 to 10. When discussing Halle Berry, Trump considered her body parts as separate objects.
“I’ll tell you what. I think she’s got from the mid section to the shoulders_—_she’s a 10,” Trump said. “The face is a solid 8. And the legs are maybe a little bit less than that.”
Despite the negative reception so far, the Trump campaign appears to be ready to further this particular news cycle. NBC News reporter Anthony Terrell obtained Machado-related talking points that the Trump camp distributed to its surrogates. The talking points emphasize that “Mr. Trump has spent his career promoting women” and encourage surrogates to pivot to bringing up Monica Lewinsky instead.
This, too, is a page out of an old Trump playbook. The Trump campaign has frequently suggested that Hillary Clinton should be held accountable for her husband’s infidelities_—_playing into the tired sexist trope that women are somehow responsible for bad behavior perpetrated by the men they happen to be romantically connected to.
On Machado’s end, the story isn’t going away anytime soon, either. Right-wing outlets are currently rushing to smear her, calling her character into question because she looks like someone who once appeared in pornography.
On a press call with reporters earlier this week, Machado_—_who has spoken openly about relapsing into bulimia after Trump publicly shamed her_—_said that watching Trump run for president has been like “a bad dream.”
“I never imagined 20 years later I’d be in this position,” she said. "
100188,1010,Trump’s campaign manager accidentally admits Trump broke the law on live TV,https://thinkprogress.org/trump-manager-conway-admits-illegal-cuba-spending-c53ab74ff200#.jrp3wt41d,7,"Donald Trump’s campaign manager appeared to unwittingly confirm an explosive Newsweek story on Thursday, telling ABC’s The View that a Trump company did indeed spend money in Cuba in 1998, in violation of a longstanding U.S. embargo that Trump has vociferously defended.
Newsweek’s Kurt Eichenwald reported on Thursday that Trump Hotels & Casino Resorts spent at least $68,000 in 1998 in Cuba, “at a time when the corporate expenditure of even a penny in the Caribbean country was prohibited without U.S. government approval.” The story notes that “with Trump’s knowledge, executives funneled the cash for the Cuba trip through an American consulting firm.” After the consultants traveled to Cuba and spent the funds, the consultants instructed Trump’s company on “how to make it appear legal by linking it after the fact to a charitable effort.”
Asked about the report, Conway first tried to defend Trump by pointing out that the company ultimately decided not to invest in Cuba and therefore was “not treasonous.”
“Read the entire story. It starts out with a screaming headline, as it usually does, that he did business in Cuba. And then it turns out he decided not to invest there.”
Asked if she was denying that they spent the funds, she conceded: “I think they paid money, as I understand from the story, they paid money in 1998.” Conway then attempted to claim a double standard, “We’re not supposed to talk about years ago when it comes to the Clinton, but with Trump, there is no statute of limitations ever.” Conway then noted that Trump has been “very critical of Cuba” and gave a speech to the Cuban American National Foundation in Miami “critical of those who want to do business with Castro” a year later.
Watch: Sen. Marco Rubio (R-FL), who has endorsed Trump after losing the Republican nomination to the millionaire real estate investor, said on Thursday that the allegations are “very serious and troubling” and called on Trump’s campaign to answer the questions raised by the report.
UPDATE: BuzzFeed’s Kyle Blaine reported on Thursday afternoon that the Trump campaign distributed talking points to surrogates urging them to dismiss Eichenwald as a “totally discredited reporter” with “manufactured reports,” to dismiss this and other reports as “being from “10, 20, or even 30 years” back, and to change the subject to the Clinton’s “special interest donors.”
Eichenwald responded with a Tweet noting that the Trump campaign still has not addressed the allegations.
Soon after, on MSNBC, Trump surrogate Steve Cortes acknowledged much of Eichenwald’s report, but argued, “If this was a violation, I think it was an incredibly technical one” and “if he had a technical violation there, I don’t think we can really fault him much for that.”"
100189,1010,Trump digs in on why refusing to pay taxes makes him ‘smart’,https://thinkprogress.org/trump-lie-income-taxes-37d23eee89b4#.y8q3pw8cr,7,"At the first presidential debate earlier this week, Republican nominee Donald Trump seemed to admit that he doesn’t pay anything in federal income taxes. But he’s spent the days since lying about what he said.
Speculating about why Trump has refused to release his tax returns during the debate, Democratic rival Hillary Clinton said, “Maybe he doesn’t want the american people, all of you watching tonight, to know that he’s paid nothing in federal taxes.” She noted that when Trump was made to hand over tax returns over the years, “they showed he didn’t pay any income tax.”
Trump broke in to say, “That makes me smart.” But since then, he’s tried to pretend that that’s not what he said. When CNN’s Dana Bash quoted his own statement back to him hours after the debate, he told her, “No, I didn’t say that at all.”
He went even further on Wednesday night, rewriting the debate exchange in an appearance on Fox’s Bill O’Reilly.
O’Reilly brought up “the statement that you made that you were smart for paying as few taxes you could possibly pay.”
Trump responded, “No I didn’t say that. What she said is, ‘Maybe you paid no taxes,’ and I said, ‘Well that would make me very smart.’”
He repeated it later in the interview, saying, “I never said I didn’t pay taxes. She said, ‘Maybe you didn’t pay taxes,’ and I said, ‘You know, that would make me smart.’” It’s only inserting a few words, but what Trump claimed to say on O’Reilly’s show is entirely different than what he actually said. Trump’s debate statement was that he is smart because he doesn’t pay income taxes, not that it “would” make him smart if that were true.
It also runs counter to what we do know about some of his tax returns. At least five times in the past 40 years, when forced to hand over documents, it was clear that he paid nothing or virtually nothing in income taxes. In some of those years it was due to massive business losses at his casinos, but in others it seems he may have erroneously reported no income on his returns.
Trump went on to tell O’Reilly just why it would make him smart not to pay taxes. “Tax is a big expense,” he said. “I wouldn’t mind paying taxes a lot less if our politicians knew how to spend the money, but they don’t. They waste the money. I mean, they don’t know what they’re doing with the money.”
He also thinks refusing to pay taxes in full makes him an attractive leader to voters. “A lot of people say, ‘That’s the kind of thinking that I want running this nation,’” he went on. “The fact is that I think people are looking at it like, ‘Maybe that’s the kind of person we need.’”
One example of waste he pointed to was money spent in “the Middle East.” But taxes help fund much more than wars_—_although Trump himself has called for big increases in military spending overall, which would require new revenue from somewhere. He’s promised to make up for it with cuts to other parts of government, but those cuts would have to be more like enormous gashes to make up for the extra spending. And the programs that would take the hit might have more support than Trump thinks: scientific and medical research, education, infrastructure like harbors and airports, and even some of Trump’s own priorities like veteran health care or border enforcement.
Taxes also help fund other big programs that Americans generally love, like Social Security and Medicare.
Trump is not the only wealthy person to exploit any available loopholes to lower his tax bill_—_the 400 Americans with the highest incomes paid a tax rate of 17 percent on their incomes, even though they should be subject to the top 39.6 percent rate. Trump has proposed giving the rich an even bigger break, as the wealthiest would see the largest benefit from his tax plan by far. Yet a recent analysis found that he would actually raise taxes for many families who make much less."

His personal attacks and shouted bits of nationalist rhetoric are almost enough to make anyone forget that he’s also an anti-science loon. And while his rants in that area usually target climate change (a well-known Chinese hoax perpetrated on America to gain a manufacturing advantage, he claims), that’s far from the limit of Trump’s war on facts.

Donald Trump is also an anti-vaxxer.

Donald Trump has not only spread dangerous misinformation about the links between vaccines and autism, but he’s also given money to the anti-vaxxer cause.
If you’ve been wondering just who the Donald J. Trump Foundation does cut a check for when it’s not paying off Donald J. Trump’s bills or buying football helmets for Donald J. Trump or paying for giant ego-boasting portraits of Donald J. Trump, here’s your answer.

His monetary support for the conspiracy theory came in the form of a $10,000 check to an anti-vaccine charity run by former Playboy model and television host Jenny McCarthy.

What a surprise. When Trump decided to give some money, it was to a former model and TV host. The problem, of course, is that McCarthy’s charity is anything but charitable. It spreads a thoroughly-debunked doctrine of imaginary harm caused by vaccines. Equally awful, it caters to a pretend system of “alternative vaccination physicians” that put children at risk of very real, and very harmful, infections.

And don’t think Donald Trump paid McCarthy just because she’s blond (though that does seem to be a habit when it comes to checks from Trump’s foundation). Trump totally believes in vaccines … right until he doesn’t.

“Autism has become an epidemic… I am totally in favor of vaccines. But I want smaller doses over a longer period of time,” Trump said, before rambling on about a child who “went to have the vaccine, and came back, and a week later got a tremendous fever, got very, very sick, now is autistic.”
Trump’s vaccine beliefs may seem inconsistent and insensible. But then, neither sense nor science is required on the alt-right.

Ultimately, Trump’s vaccination campaign gives insight into the kooky alternate reality that the Republican nominee lives in, inhabited by outlandish claims and outright lies: from his remarks this week that Google is conspiring to bury negative Hillary Clinton stories, to his belief that thousands of U.S. Muslims cheered on the terror attacks of 9/11, to the Obama “birther” conspiracy—the list goes on and on.
As important as it is to think about what Donald Trump might do if he had control of the United States military, and what he might do to the Supreme Court, take a moment to think about what a Trump administration might inflict on the National Institutes of Health.

Trump’s crusade on vaccines puts children at risk. Trump was not only willing to trumpet this dangerous misinformation—he gave money to advance it."

He’s also the owner of a Facebook page filled with a smorgasbord of racism that has raised demands that he resign.

The calls for resignation come after a Facebook page apparently belonging to Wasko posted in June a picture of a monkey, saying it's a picture of Michelle Obama and a wagon of orangutans captioned ""moving day at the White House.""
Sure that seems bad—worse than bad. But it’s not the worst of Wasko’s hate-fest.

One of the more overt posts was a picture of Clint Eastwood holding a noose with the text ""Barry this rope is for you. Wanna bring that empty chair over here!""
There’s another set of posts on the page that might sound … a little familiar.

He has various posts calling Obama and Hillary the leaders of ISIS, Hillary behind bars, and various others.
Where would anyone get ideas like that? And what would make anyone—much less a mayor—feel like it was okay to publicly display this level of racism and raw hate in 2016. There’s a simple answer.

The West York Council President Shawn Mauck told CNN … that the posts are a result of the ""age of Trump that has made anything possible.”
What does Wasko have to say for himself? He’s staying true to his leader’s words.

On Thursday, Wasko wrote on his Facebook page that he will not be ""politically correct, I will say what is on my mind and what I believe in …""  
Well, Donald Trump did tell his followers he was going to make all their dreams come true. Apparently this is the kind of thing that Trump supporters dream about."

That we had to wait until after the election to ""let the people decide"" who should be naming the Supreme Court. So, Senate Republicans, after this week in Trump, what do you think about that? 

You don't even really have to go beyond 3 AM Friday morning and the tweetstorm of the century. Because nothing says presidential like refusing to let an extremely damaging story die, making it headline news for the fourth day in a row. So, yeah, a guy who takes to Twitter at 3:14 in the morning to call a young woman ""disgusting"" and ""terrible,"" after he called her fat and horrible, yeah, that's a guy you want making the big decisions. 

And that's just the tip of the iceberg in this week in Trump! The debate! The admitting that he doesn't pay taxes,  and turning around and saying he never said what he said about his taxes an hour later! And speaking of debate lies, boy, Trump really killed it! Thirty-four lies in 90 minutes, and he only talked about half of the time!

Speaking of taxes, hey, how about that Foundation that isn't actually a foundation because it has never been certified as a charitable organization? That makes the fact that Trump hasn't actually given any of his own money to it in nearly a decade practically moot. 

Oh, and hey, Cuba. He'd have a head start on Nixon when it comes to doing the president doing illegal things, since he's already broken the law by doing business in Castro's Cuba during the embargo. 

He doesn't pay taxes, he has a scam charitable foundation that he hasn't even donated to and he illegally did business in Castro's Cuba. He attacks young women for their looks and is so certain he's in the right to do so he carries on the attacks for four days! 

This? This is who Senate Republicans think should be in charge of nominating Supreme Court justices? And that's barely scratching the surface of just one week in Trump news. Every Republican senator—all the ones running for re-election and all the other ones too—need to be pressed on this, and pressed hard. Because it's on them, now. They have to answer what comes first: their party or their country.

The new poll sponsored by two Florida Fox TV stations showed a was a dead-heat with Clinton measuring in at 46.6 percent and Trump barely behind her at 46.3 percent.

Libertarian Gary Johnson received the support of a mere 3.9 percent of respondents while the Green Party’s Jill Stein came in with a tiny 1.7 percent.

As the campaigns are winding down, only nine respondents said they were still undecided.

The poll also had good news for U.S. Senate candidate and former GOP presidential hopeful Marco Rubio. 47.1 percent of respondents said they’d vote for Rubio over the 42.9 percent who picked Democrat challenger Patrick Murphy.

The poll also found that 50.6 percent thought Hillary won the first debate while 40.5 percent thought Trump did. But this perception clearly didn’t affect the votes of too many Trump supporters.

The poll was taken between Sept. 28 and Sept. 29 and has a 4 percent margin of error. The poll was somewhat small, with 223 Republicans and 229 Democrats participating alongside 167 independents."

",http://www.breitbart.com/2016-presidential-race/2016/09/30/poll-mere-29-percent-trust-media-fact-checking/,8,"Only 29 percent of likely American voters “trust media fact-checking of candidates’ comments,” according to a late September survey from Rasmussen Reports, while a prior poll indicated presidential debate moderators would help Clinton over Trump.
Sixty-two percent of American likely voters, 88 percent of Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump supporters, 69 percent of voters not affiliated with either the Republican or Democratic political parties, and 79 percent of Republican voters “believe the media skew the facts to help candidates they support.” These results come from a survey of 1,000 likely voters from September 28-29.

Fifty-nine percent of Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton’s supporters, 51 percent of liberals, but just 29 percent of those likely voters actually trust media fact-checking of the candidates’ comments.

“Among the supporters of Libertarian Gary Johnson and Green Party candidate Jill Stein, sizable majorities also don’t trust media fact-checking,” Rasmussen stated of the poll.

Rasmussen also stated:

The majority of voters in most demographic categories believe the media play favorites when they fact-check candidates’ comments.

Blacks are more trusting of media fact-checking than whites and other minority voters are. In addition, 79 percent of conservatives and 58 percent of moderates believe media skews fact-checking to support their supported candidates. Only 40 percent of Democrats and 39 percent of liberals felt the same.

The survey had a margin of error of +/- 3 percentage points.

Rasmussen pointed to its own survey from July which showed 69 percent of voters believe,“reporters try to help the candidate they want to win” and they “think it’s far more likely they will help the Democrat than the Republican.”

A September Rasmussen poll taken in the week before 2016’s first general election presidential debate revealed a plurality of voters expected moderators in the upcoming debates to aid Clinton over Trump. Only six percent thought moderators would try to help Trump compared to the 46 percent that believed moderators would try to help Clinton."

“It’s probably true,” Voight told a TMZ reporter on Thursday.

Doubling down, the actor and ardent Trump supporter said “Google is certainly working for Hillary” and added that the entire “mainstream media is in the tank for the Democrat party.”

“This is real.” Breitbart News reported on the allegations against Google in August. Searches for terms related to stories about Hillary Clinton’s health typed into Google’s engine returned Autocomplete suggestions like “Hillary’s healthcare plan,” while the same searches inputted in search engines like Bing and Yahoo returned Autocomplete terms like “Hillary Clinton’s health problems” or “Hillary Clinton’s health issues.”

Trump mentioned the allegations in a rally speech in Wisconsin this week: “A new post-debate poll that just came out, the Google poll, has us leading Hillary Clinton by two points nationwide, and that’s despite the fact that Google search engine was suppressing the bad news about Hillary Clinton.”

The Verge reports that Trump was likely referring to a Independent Journal Review post-debate poll conducted by Google Consumer Surveys.

In June, the search engine told the Washington Times that “Google Autocomplete does not favor any candidate or cause. Claims to the contrary simply misunderstand how Autocomplete works.”

Still, Voight even went so far as to warn against the possibility that the Clinton campaign might plant pro-Clinton audiences members in seats at the next presidential debate.

“Are people set up within the audience?” he asked. “I’m sure that people want to win, and that’s the way it is.”

The Academy Award-winning actor has spent months speaking up in support of the Republican nominee, after formally endorsing Trump in March in an exclusive interview with Breitbart News.

Earlier this month, during an interview on the Fox Business network, Voight said he doesn’t “think there’s any place Donald Trump can’t win.” "
100196,1003,Donald Trump Is Trying To Lose,http://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/donald-trump-is-trying-to-lose_us_57eec738e4b095bd896a0d56?utm_hp_ref=politics,8,"Several months ago, my dad and I were walking along Pennsylvania Avenue where we took a selfie in front of the White House. As it always does these days, our conversation turned to Donald Trump.

As we strolled a bit farther down the street, we came across the scaffolding surrounding what will become Trump’s latest project_—_a new fantastic, wonderful, hotel that is beautiful and that people will really love, believe me.

It was then that I could picture it. This is where it all would end. Trump would stand in front of a microphone (a fully operational one, not one of those defective ones the deceptive mainstream media gave him during the first debate), and say that, while he didn’t win the presidency, he would still have a great room on Pennsylvania Avenue. (Full disclosure: I thought/hoped this would happen a lot sooner than November.)

In front of that hotel, my dad (who is in real estate, and has been a Trump-observer for decades) repeated a theory he has clung to since the day Donald announced his candidacy.

“I don’t think he really wants to win. He just wants the attention and the fame. Not the job.”

While this is certainly possible, I’ve always assumed that at some point, Trump turned a corner and really wanted his next office to be Oval.

But my dad insisted, over and over, “He doesn’t want to win.”

So let’s posit a theory. The man who talks about nothing but winning actually wants to lose.

It explains everything. He refused to practice for the debates. He makes gaffe after gaffe. He doubles down on the worst parts of his performances. That’s crazy if you want the White House. But it’s genius if you want the headlines. All press is good press. It’s the perfect plan if your personal dopamine hit is seeing your own name in the headlines, day after day.

Remember all that sniffing during the debate? He was snorting Donald Trump.

You can say a lot of negative things about Trump. But one thing you have to admit is that he is the master self-promoter in the age of self-promotion. Kanye West thinks he needs too much attention. He has figured out a way to put his name on buildings he doesn’t fully own. He is the most famous rich guy who isn’t even that rich. And in the last year, he has become the most talked-about human in the world.

And that’s just what he set out to become.

You can say that Daddy gave him the money to start the real estate business. But he built his personal brand with smoke and mirrors of his own making.

It’s obvious that he never thought he could get this far. And everything makes sense if you accept that he doesn’t want to get any farther. You really think the master media manipulator of our era couldn’t do better in a debate than that schlub who showed up on Monday night? Every bit of evidence we’ve seen over the past few decades suggests otherwise. Donald kills on reality TV. He kills on Howard Stern. He kills every time he is trying to sell the one product he really cares about: Donald Trump.

Not buying it yet?

Well, consider the most important and unexpected line of the first debate_—_one that the pundits glossed over or completely ignored. It was his comment about that same hotel in DC:

We’re just opening up on Pennsylvania Avenue right next to the White House, so if I don’t get there one way, I’m going to get to Pennsylvania Avenue another.
If I don’t get there one way… In other words, if I lose. Remember, this is a guy who’s main selling point from the earliest primary battles was that he is winning. Why, at the biggest moment and on the biggest stage, would he mention his plans in the event he loses?

Think it was just a slip? Sure, maybe the most media-savvy self-promoter of our era accidentally said he might lose…

Or maybe my dad is right. Maybe that’s been the plan all along.

He gets the fame. He’ll continue to get the media attention. And he’ll crush one of the most famous adages we have: Everyone will remember who came in second place.

He hasn’t pivoted towards the center in the general election. He hasn’t spent much of his own money on ads. He hasn’t built a big ground operation. He won’t listen to advisors who tell him to brush up on the issues or prepare for debates.

And he’s spent the entire general election saying things that would have completely destroyed any traditional campaign.

And there’s the rub; the one thing that’s surprised so many observers and probably Trump himself. And the thing that is by far the most depressing and troubling element of this whole sick moment in American history.

He’s trying to lose. But the voters won’t let him."

Buried in Politico’s daily newsletter on September 28, the news comes as the Trump campaign has also announced that another climate change denier — Myron Ebell of the Competitive Enterprise Institute (CEI) — is leading Trump’s EPA transition team.

White currently serves as a fellow-in-residence at the Texas Public Policy Foundation, which, like CEI, is funded by ExxonMobil and Koch Industries, and she also serves on the Trump campaign’s economic advisory team. 

White co-heads the Texas Public Policy Foundation’s Fueling Freedom Project, which has among its stated goals to “explain the forgotten moral case for fossil fuels” and “end the regulation of CO2 as a pollutant.”

In addition, she formerly served as a special assistant to First Lady Nancy Reagan in the Ronald Reagan White House, as former Texas Republican Governor Rick Perry’s appointee to the Texas Center on Environmental Quality (TCEQ) and as an appointee to the Texas Water Development Board under then-Governor George W. Bush.

News of White’s possible EPA appointment comes as scientists say the planet has now permanently passed the threshold of 400 parts per million of atmospheric carbon dioxide (CO2). At a global temperature rise of 2 degrees Celsius, the scientific consensus says we could see calamitous impacts, while many say the already locked-in warming of 1.5 degrees is the safe limit.

White is only one of many Trump campaign consultants with direct ties to the hydraulic fracturing (“fracking”) industry.

Trump’s prospective Secretary of Energy under Trump and a key campaign energy adviser, Harold Hamm, also has an industry connection as CEO and founder of a major fracking company, Continental Resources. Continental has a stake in the building of both the northern leg of the Keystone XL and Dakota Access pipelines.

Politico’s Morning Energy also reported that Larry Nichols, the co-founder and retired CEO of fracking giant Devon Energy, serves on the Trump campaign as an energy adviser. Devon Energy also funds the Texas Public Policy Foundation and CEI.

Moore told Morning Energy that Hamm, Nichols, and White are “among a small group of people who have Donald Trump’s ear on energy policy.” Moore himself founded the Koch Industries-funded Club for Growth, a right-wing political fundraising group, and he and White co-authored a book published in May titled, “Fueling Freedom: Exposing the Mad War on Energy.”

“I’ve been told by some of the staff it’s been useful to them,” White told SNL Energy Finance Daily in a recent interview of the book, which includes chapters promoting fracking, calling green energy a false hope, and referring to the looming creation of a “Saudi America.”

Like White, Moore formerly worked in the Reagan White House, serving as research director for President Reagan’s Privatization Commission.

Climate Denier, Fracking, Coal Promoter

On numerous instances, White has disavowed climate change and denied that it is caused by human activity. Mirroring her, Trump has dismissed climate change as a Chinese hoax. However, Trump denied saying that during the first presidential debate when brought up by Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton.

“No matter how many times, the President, EPA and the media rant about ‘dirty carbon pollution,’ there is no pollution about carbon itself! As a dictionary will tell you, carbon is the chemical basis of all life,” White wrote in September 2015.

“Our flesh, blood and bones are built of carbon. Carbon dioxide (CO2) is the gas of life on this planet, an essential nutrient for plant growth on which human life depends. How craftily our government has masked these fundamental realities and the environmental benefits of fossil fuels!”

She also derided climate science as having been “institutionalized” by elites and elite institutions, writing that dealing with the problem of climate change would be akin to allowing societal collapse.

“The weak science and counterproductive policies have been institutionalized in law, academia, media, and culture,” she wrote in the National Review magazine in March 2016. “The elites effectively promote the specter of a planetary meltdown forecast by supposedly unequivocal science, while they dismiss the civilizational threat of trying to decarbonize human society.”

In August 2016, White wrote an article deriding President Barack Obama’s “deluded and illegitimate battle against climate change.”

Beyond denying climate change, White also serves as a major promoter of fracking for shale oil and gas and of exporting U.S.-produced oil. She has also written a report and given a speech making a “moral case” for fossil fuel production and consumption. “A rapid increase of domestic supplies of oil and gas at a time of painful gas prices; high-paying new jobs; expansion of thousands of businesses; increased federal, state, and local tax revenues: What’s not to like?,” wrote White. 

“The U.S. has far more energy resources than any other country, yet no other country so limits and blocks access to its own energy supply. The opposition to fracking displays this unfortunate mentality.”

In a recent article White concluded that the 2016 Republican Party platform “is right” and that “coal is clean,“ while in another article in October 2013 she came out against the regulation of coal-fired power plants by the Obama administration and its Clean Power Plan.

“The imperial EPA has once again raised its scepter, this time proposing the first hard caps on carbon dioxide emissions from coal-fired power plants,” she wrote. “The proposed coal rule merits a deeper assessment than it has yet received. The impacts of this and other EPA rules targeting coal go far beyond the coal industry. The EPA is undermining the very foundations of economic productivity.”

Internal documents published by the group Common Cause show that in 2010, White attended the American Legislative Exchange Council‘s Energy, Environmental, and Agriculture Task Force meeting. The Texas Public Policy Foundation is a member of the ALEC-created State Policy Network, a collective of industry-funded think-tanks (called “stink tanks“ by critics) which produce reports and other public relations materials in service to the right-wing corporate agenda.

“Get White Out”

Perhaps portending what an EPA would look under her watch, in 2007 White came under fire for her inaction on climate change and environmental concerns while chairing TCEQ, with the watchdog group Public Citizen creating a billboard image near the TCEQ’s headquarters demanding to “Get White Out” and also crafting a website by the same name.

Public Citizen said White had not done enough to halt climate change or slow mercury and air pollution and also said she tried to erode democracy by eliminating the right to comment publicly on a proposed project unless one lived within two miles of its proposed site.

“Chairman White has failed to lead our environmental agency in the right direction. Instead of acting to curb the serious threat from global warming, the TCEQ buried its head in the sand, and determined that global warming impacts would not have to be considered in the contested case hearings for any of the coal plant permits,” Get White Out’s website said of her tenure. 

One thing seems clear: If he wins in November, Trump’s climate and energy team will likely wipe out any U.S. progress on the ever-worsening global climate crisis."
100198,1003,What (if Anything) Does Donald Trump Respect?,http://www.huffingtonpost.com/andy-schmookler/what-if-anything-does-don_b_12218798.html?utm_hp_ref=politics,8,"When we Americans choose a president we need to consider more than their political inclinations. We must consider also the moral spirit in which they will use the great power they’ve been given.

In particular, will he or she be restrained — by respect for others and for the political system and culture in which they are working — from abusing that power.

“Respect” is a key concept here—defined as “a feeling of admiration or deference.” Such respect can be directed toward a person, or group, or ideal, etc.

In that context, we should ask: What does Donald Trump respect?

1) Does Trump show respect for other people?

He certainly did not show respect to his opponents—like “Little Marco,” and “Lyin’ Ted,” and Jeb with his “low energy.”

As Megyn Kelly’s famous question at the Fox News Republican debate showed, Trump has not been respectful of women.

And Trump has consistently shown disrespect for anyone who has said anything critical about him, whether it be Paul Ryan or the Gold Star father.

Toward his major allies, Trump has been benign but not respectful, as when he’s treated Chris Christie and VP candidate Mike Pence with casual - almost humiliating - disregard.

While it’s true that Trump has spoken respectfully of Russian President Putin, that has been a way of putting down his own political adversaries: e.g. saying Putin is strong as a way of saying Obama is weak.

A poll conducted by the AP finds that 60% of registered voters in the U.S. believe that Trump “does not respect ordinary Americans.”

2) Has Trump shown respect for the norms and laws by which Americans encourage and require right behavior?

When Trump derided “Little Marco” and “Lyin’ Ted,” it was shocking because we had not - until then - seen anyone on so prominent a political stage violate a norm that says insulting people is unacceptable. Trump has made disrespect for that norm a cornerstone of his political strategy.

For more than forty years, there has been a norm that presidential candidates will release their tax returns to the public. Never before Trump has it been so important to get a clear picture of a candidate’s financial dealings, but Trump is the first candidate to refuse to respect that norm.

Hundreds of workers and small contractors have complained that Trump has stiffed them on work he contracted with them to perform. Not only is honoring one’s contractual obligations a norm, but it is a legal requirement. It is one, however, that evidently Trump does not respect.

There are laws concerning how charitable monies may and may not be used, and we now know that Trump has not respected these laws - using charitable funds donated by others to settle his own legal battles, and to buy portraits of himself.

Perhaps most remarkable has been Trump’s consistent disrespect of truthfulness. The L.A. Times has said, “Never in modern presidential politics has a major candidate made false statements as routinely as Trump has.” And the Pulitzer-prize-winning fact-checking organization, Politifact, has found eight times as many “pants-on-fire” level falsehoods among Trump’s statements as among those of his Democratic opponent.

(For just one example, on Trump’s signature issue of immigration: 1) Far from there being the ongoing wave of illegal immigration that Trump asserts, the number of such unauthorized immigrants in the U.S. has decreased in the past eight years; and, 2) as the conservative Cato Institute reports, contrary to Trump’s alarmist assertions about immigrants as dangerous criminals, immigrants are less crime-prone than our native-born population.)

Perhaps most important for Americans to ponder before casting their votes is how much respect has Trump shown for the Constitution. Here the pattern of disrespect is no different: he has foretold actions he would take as president that would usurp the powers of Congress, curtail the ability of the press to criticize him, and impose unconstitutional forms of discrimination based on religion. The conservative National Review recently criticized Trump’s autocratic view of the presidency as “A Constitution of One.”

This pattern poses a problem bigger than liberal vs. conservative policies.

The attitude of respect — for people and for America’s norms and laws — seems alien to Mr. Trump’s character. What basis, then, is there for believing that — in wielding the mighty powers of the presidency — he will be governed by anything but his own will and his own self-regard?"
100199,1004,Debate Commission Now Says Trump Had Audio 'Issues' Monday Night,http://talkingpointsmemo.com/livewire/debate-commission-trump-microphone,8,"After Donald Trump complained that his microphone at the first presidential debate was ""terrible,"" the Commission on Presidential Debates issued a short statement Friday saying that the Republican nominee's audio had ""issues.""

""Regarding the first debate, there were issues regarding Donald Trump's audio that affected the sound level in the debate hall,"" the statement from the debate commission read.

Following the debate, Trump complained that the sound on his microphone was ""going on and off."" ""I had a problem with a microphone that didn't work,"" he said on ""Fox and Friends"" Tuesday morning. ""My microphone was terrible. I wonder, was it set up that way on purpose? My microphone, in the room they couldn't hear me, you know, it was going on and off. Which isn't exactly great. I wonder if it was set up that way, but it was terrible.""

The one-sentence statement from the debate commission did not suggest that the audio issues Trump experienced affected the television broadcast of the debate. "
100200,1004,"Trump On 3 AM Tweets: At Least 'I Will Be There, Awake, To Answer The Call!'",http://talkingpointsmemo.com/livewire/trump-3am-miss-universe-tweets,8,"Donald Trump tweeted Friday afternoon that he shouldn't be criticized for tweeting about former Miss Universe Alicia Machado's purported ""sex tape"" in the wee hours of the morning because ""at least you know I will be there, awake, to answer the call!""

""For those few people knocking me for tweeting at three o'clock in the morning, at least you know I will be there, awake, to answer the call!"" he tweeted. The comment is likely a reference to a campaign ad from Hillary Clinton during the 2008 Democratic presidential primary season, in which a narrator asked, ""It's 3 a.m. and your children are asleep. Who do you want answering the phone?""

Republicans, including Trump, have long claimed Clinton metaphorically missed that 3 a.m. call and was asleep when the attack on the American diplomatic compound began in Benghazi, Libya. But congressional inquiries have found Clinton was immediately engaged in the response to Benghazi. "
100201,1004,"Newsweek Website Attacked After Report On Trump, Cuban Embargo",http://talkingpointsmemo.com/livewire/dos-hack-newsweek-trump-cuba-embargo-story,8,"The editor-in-chief of Newsweek confirmed Friday that the magazine's website was on the receiving end of a denial-of-service attack Thursday night, following the publication of a story accusing one of Donald Trump's companies of violating the Cuban trade embargo.

Editor-In-Chief Jim Impoco noted that the attack came as the story earned national attention.

""Last night we were on the receiving end of what our IT chief called a 'massive' DoS (denial of service) attack,"" Impoco wrote in an email to TPM. ""The site was down most of last evening, at a time when Kurt Eichenwald's story detailing how Donald Trump's company broke the law by violating the U.S. trade embargo against Cuba was being covered extensively by prominent cable news programs. Our IT team is still investigating the hack.""

Later Friday afternoon, Impoco emailed TPM that in an initial investigation, the ""main"" IP addresses linked to the attack were found to be Russian. It should be noted that it is possible to fake an IP address.

""As with any DDoS attack, there are lots of IP addresses, but the main ones are Russian, though that in itself does not prove anything,"" he wrote. ""We are still investigating.""

A DoS attack makes sites completely unavailable to their intended users. Many noted that Newsweek's website was down last night, initially assuming that it was due to high traffic on the Cuba piece. But Eichenwald tweeted Friday morning that the actual issue was an attack on the magazine's website: Denial-of-service attacks may be considered a federal crime under the Computer Fraud and Abuse Act."
100202,1005,Trump Praised Saudi Arabia's Shariah Law for Making It Easy for Men to Get Divorced,http://www.motherjones.com/politics/2016/09/time-donald-trump-called-saudi-arabia-good-place-get-divorce,8,"In order to avoid admitting to cheating on his wife, Donald Trump invoked his Fifth Amendment right against self-incrimination 97 times during his divorce proceedings with Ivana Trump in 1990, the Huffington Post reported Friday. So it should come as little surprise that Trump had kind words for a system that allows men to divorce their wives without going to court: Saudi Arabia's Shariah law.

The Republican presidential candidate praised the Islamic law, or Shariah, system during a 60-second syndicated daily radio commentary called ""Trumped!"" that he recorded from 2004 to 2008. In a January 2008 segment, Trump discussed a news story of a Saudi man who had divorced his wife for watching a television show while alone at home because, in Trump's telling, the husband considered it tantamount to being alone with a strange man.

""Men in Saudi Arabia have the authority to divorce their wives without going to the courts,"" Trump said. ""I guess that would also mean they don't need prenuptial agreements. The fact is, no courts, no judges—Saudi Arabia sounds like a very good place to get a divorce.""

BuzzFeed first uncovered the show and its website in March, and the Wall Street Journal published some audio and transcripts in July. According to BuzzFeed, stations that still have an archive of the shows cannot release the audio without Trump's permission.

When it comes to Trump's beliefs about women, Trump's radio vignettes often mirror his own life and his past treatment of and attitudes toward women that are now haunting his campaign.

In recent days, Trump has threatened to begin attacking Hillary Clinton for her husband's infidelities. But it's Trump who has extensive experience with divorce—and it's no wonder he would have preferred the Saudi system. Before finalizing his divorce from his first wife, Ivana, Trump began seeing Marla Maples, who would become his second wife. The divorce required five depositions, during which he repeatedly took the Fifth.

Trump's remarks about Saudi Arabia were not the only commentary from his radio show with relevance to Trump's own marriages. Trump often used the show to discuss the appearance of female celebrities. In one segment from 2005, Trump noted that pop star Britney Spears had disappeared from a list of the sexiest women alive compiled by FHM, a men's magazine. ""Angelina [Jolie] took over the crown from Britney Spears, who didn't even make the sexy list this year,"" Trump said. ""She has gone down, there's no question about it. That's what a marriage can do for you.""

His belief that marriage hurts a woman's appearance wasn't great news for his own marriage to Ivana. As that union unraveled, he made it clear to her that her looks had deteriorated—and Ivana seemed to internalize that critique and blame herself. ""She threw herself into my arms sobbing and crying and saying, 'Donald doesn't want me anymore,'"" former New York Daily News columnist Liz Smith recently recalled. ""'He has told me, he can't be sexually attracted to a woman who has had children.'"" In order to entice her husband, Ivana got a face lift and a breast augmentation, Smith said.

It didn't work. Trump was seeing a new woman and setting the stage for his future radio commentary about Saudi Arabia."

The allegation that Machado once starred in a porn film has been debunked by numerous sources. The smear campaign comes days after the first presidential debate on Monday, when Hillary Clinton said Trump had called Machado ""Miss Piggy"" to ridicule her appearance. Following the debate, Trump doubled down on his fat-shaming by calling Machado's previous ""massive"" weight gain a ""real problem."""
100204,1005,Donald Trump's Favorite Anti-Immigrant Sheriff May Finally Lose an Election,http://www.motherjones.com/politics/2016/09/joe-arpaios-23-year-reign-might-finally-be-coming-end,8,"Joe Arpaio, the sheriff of Maricopa County, Arizona, walked onto the stage at the Republican National Convention in Cleveland, a few hours before Donald Trump was supposed to deliver his acceptance speech. Arpaio, a tough-on-illegal-immigration crusader, flashed a peace sign as the crowd roared its approval. Wearing an oversize black suit and a tie pin in the shape of a pistol, the 84-year-old sheriff said he's spent 55 years in law enforcement, but his ""most important mission has just begun: to help elect Donald Trump president of the United States.""

Trump is the only candidate strong enough to defend the nation from ""terrorists coming over our border, infiltrating our communities and causing massive destruction and mayhem,"" he said, adding that ""criminals [are] penetrating our weak border security system and committing serious crime.""

Arpaio earned his spot on the RNC stage by styling himself as ""America's Toughest Sheriff,"" who famously stops immigrants for no reason, dresses jail inmates in pink underwear, and houses the inmates in Korean War tents in the desert heat. He's ridden his fame to six four-year terms as sheriff of the country's fourth-biggest county.

Now running for his seventh term, he's facing an opponent with better poll numbers whose message is getting a signal boost with $300,000 from liberal billionaire George Soros. He's also having his own trouble with the law, with a looming criminal contempt referral for disobeying the orders of a federal judge who sought to restrain some of his anti-immigrant excesses. He's saddled Maricopa County taxpayers with more than $140 million in settlement fees and court costs—the results of his sometimes overzealous approach to law enforcement.

Arpaio has been a national figure for years, but this year's race underscores the wider political fight playing out across the country: Donald Trump's xenophobic brand of populist bigotry has propelled the once-taboo and semi-fringe identity politics of white racists back into the mainstream conversation. For years Arpaio has been a leading national figure for fighting and criminalizing undocumented immigrants, and this race is drawing a lot of attention. Millions of dollars in out-of-state donations have poured in for Arpaio, but his challenger—retired Phoenix Police Sergeant Paul Penzone—has also drawn outside support, chiefly in the form of an independent expenditure committee funded solely by liberal financier George Soros.

Trump's nomination could push the red state blue for the first time in a generation and motivate the state's Hispanic voters to vote in greater numbers than ever before. A proposal to legalize recreational marijuana, and a minimum-wage ballot question could also drive younger Democratic-leaning voters to the polls. Republican Sen. John McCain's tough challenge from Democratic Rep. Ann Kirkpatrick has enhanced on-the-ground Democratic organization across the state and won't help Arpaio, nor will the sheriff's ongoing ""investigation"" into President Barack Obama's birth certificate.

He's somewhat like me,"" Arpaio told the Guardian , referring to Trump. ""Or I'm like him. I don't know which way it goes.""
On the other hand, Trump's intense anti-immigrant rhetoric has galvanized many voters, and Arpaio has been that crowd's hero for years. ""He's somewhat like me,"" Arpaio told the Guardian, referring to Trump. ""Or I'm like him. I don't know which way it goes."" Whichever way it is, Arpaio is still incredibly popular among Republicans in Maricopa County. He easily won the Republican primary in August, defeating three other candidates. (The second-place finisher came in nearly 40 points behind Arpaio.)

So will this be Arpaio's last election?

""If it's going to happen, it's going to happen now,"" says David Berman, a professor emeritus of political science at Arizona State University and a senior research fellow at Arizona's Morrison Institute for Public Policy. ""It's going to be the toughest election he's ever had.""

Arpaio's challenger is Paul Penzone, a retired Phoenix police sergeant who came within six points of beating the sheriff (50.66 to 44.65) in 2012. That year, a third-party candidate named Mike Stauffer siphoned off crucial votes. Some Arizona Democrats assumed Stauffer had been recruited by Arpaio's campaign to thwart a Penzone victory. They wondered again this year when third-party candidate Chad Lisk threw his hat into the ring, only to be blocked after failing to garner the requisite number of petition signatures.

""It's apparent that the voters are tired of the nonsense they've seen from the sheriff the last several terms, and we feel confident with our chances,"" said Penzone.

He says the 2012 race was closer than it looked because the percentage of the vote Arpaio received was ""barely above the median."" He rattles off the problems: Arpaio has cost county taxpayers at least $72 million, and that's from only one case related to profiling and harassing Latinos; he's facing a referral from a federal judge for criminal contempt of court related to a racial profiling case filed in 2007; his lawyers hired an investigator to look into the wife of the judge who issued that order. Penzone is announced that he filed a defamation lawsuit against Arpaio after the sheriff ran an ad recycling overstated and exaggerated claims that Penzone assaulted his ex wife in 2003. ""It's [all] just a complete abuse of his authority,"" Penzone says. ""The voters are tired of it, and I'm tired of it.""

Chad Willems, Arpaio's campaign manager, did not respond to several requests for comment. After the contempt referral, Willems told the Associated Press that the exorbitant legal fees were the fault of the American Civil Liberties Union, which brought the case, because the organization refused to settle, costing taxpayers millions in legal fees. ""If Penzone wants to side with the ACLU on this issue, he can be our guest,"" he said. He told reporters with Cronkite News at Arizona State University that polling casting doubt on Arpaio's popularity is dead wrong, and that the Arpaio campaign's internal polling suggests the incumbent will ""heavily"" defeat Penzone.

But Penzone's political challenge isn't Arpaio's only problem. The sheriff could face criminal charges after US District Court Judge Murray Snow, appointed by George W. Bush, ruled August 19 that Arpaio and another senior sheriff's deputy ignored court orders, lied to the court, and withheld information in a racial profiling case dating back to 2007. The case, Melendres v. Arpaio, was filed by a group of Latinos in Maricopa County targeted by sheriff's deputies for illegal-immigration sweeps during traffic stops. In 2011, Snow ordered Arpaio and his deputies to quit detaining suspected undocumented immigrants who had not broken any state laws. In 2013, Snow ruled that Arpaio and his deputies had discriminated against Latinos and also that Arpaio had violated the 2011 order in part to bolster his popularity during the 2012 election.

In May this year, Snow ruled that Arpaio had continued to arbitrarily detain Latinos based solely on immigration suspicions and held him in civil contempt, which left the door open for a criminal contempt referral that took place on August 19. Now the US Department of Justice will determine whether to criminally charge Arpaio with contempt of court, a crime punishable with up to six months in prison. In the middle of all this, Arpaio's attorneys hired a private investigator to investigate the judge's wife after a tipster told Arpaio that Snow's wife said that Snow wanted to get Arpaio out of office.

""This is really almost completely uncharted territory,"" says Mel McDonald, a former US attorney who is representing Arpaio privately in the criminal case. McDonald says there isn't a lot of precedent for Arpaio's case, and he's meeting with DOJ officials October 11 to figure out what the next steps will be. He says the DOJ can choose to pursue criminal charges, or it can decline to do so. Snow can then choose to appoint a special prosecutor to pursue the case.

Although Arpaio is paying for his legal defense in the criminal contempt case, the rest falls on the taxpayers of Maricopa County to the tune of $72 million, according to the Arizona Republic, which notes that in all, Arpaio has cost taxpayers $142 million in legal fees, settlements and court awards since 1993. Arpaio does have a massive war chest that dwarfs the approximately $540,000 Penzone has raised thus far. According to filings published by the county on Thursday, Arpaio has raised just more than $12 million, roughly three-fourths of which came from small donors in other states, according to the Associated Press' August analysis.

Penzone also has support from out of state: Liberal financier George Soros has stepped in to help. Soros has pumped $3 million into local district attorney races in a half-dozen states over the last year with an eye toward reforming the criminal justice system, according to Politico, with millions of dollars going toward radio and television ads. In Arizona he donated $300,000, the total budget of Maricopa Strong, an independent expenditure committee not affiliated with the Penzone campaign, according to records filed with the county. ""We're looking to persuade voters who have some doubts about Arpaio because of his record of wasting taxpayer money on lawsuits and legal fees, and losing sight of his primary mission of enforcing the law and keeping the people of Maricopa County safe,"" said a source close to Maricopa Strong.

Despite all this baggage, Arpaio still has a strong chance of extending his 23-year reign over Maricopa County. Berman, the political scientist, says pundits have been predicting a surge of Hispanic voter turnout for years—a prospect that could cripple state Republicans up and down the ballot—only for it to never materialize. He concedes that the marijuana initiative, the minimum-wage question, an organized Democratic effort in the Kirkpatrick race against McCain, and Donald Trump—let alone all of Arpaio's legal issues and history of racial profiling and harassment—could put Penzone over the top.

But there are still many more Republican voters in Maricopa County than Democrats and independents (737,439 active Republicans, 577,885 Democrats, 743,456 others). Besides, he said, it's Arpaio's true believers who have kept him in office this long.

""Arpaio has got the Trump supporter type—he has the same kind of true believer behind him,"" says Berman. ""If he went to jail, they'd still elect him. He just has this following that thinks he can do no wrong, just like Trump."""
100205,1006,Should Trump attack Hillary for trying to discredit Bill’s accusers at the next debate?,http://hotair.com/archives/2016/09/30/trump-attack-hillary-trying-discredit-bills-accusers-next-debate/,8,"I don’t know why I phrased that headline as a question. He’s obviously going to do it no matter what his fans or advisors think. The question, I guess, is whether it’ll help him or hurt him.

It’s not surprising that risk-averse Republicans on the Hill want him to stay far, far away from the subject of Monica Lewinsky. They touched the hot stove of Clinton liaisons in the 90s and got burned. They’ll never touch it again. It’s also a safe bet that Kellyanne Conway and most of the Trump brain trust don’t want him broaching this subject. They’ve spent the past six weeks trying to turn him into a more disciplined, presidential figure. A gutter fight with Clinton, who will claim victimhood in being tarred with her husband’s infidelities, is a risky proposition under those circumstances, especially with women voters. The only people who have Trump’s ear who I thought might egg him on are the pugilists like Gingrich and Christie — but even Newt thinks this is a bad play.

Well, no matter. Sounds like it’s happening.

“Mr. Trump has never treated women the way Hillary Clinton and her husband did when they worked to destroy Bill Clinton’s accusers,” reads one of the talking points the campaign sent to surrogates on Thursday as the controversy surrounding the story of former Miss Universe Alicia Machado continued to dominate headlines of the race.

And during a rally Thursday afternoon in Bedford, N.H., Trump himself referenced the scandals of the 1990s that he’s been congratulating himself for not talking about all week. “The Clintons are the sordid past,” he said. “We will be the very bright and clean future.”
Surrogates are getting into the act too:

Tennessee Rep. Marsha Blackburn brought up Paula Jones, Gennifer Flowers, and Monica Lewinsky in an MSNBC interview. Arkansas Attorney General Leslie Rutledge also said on MSNBC that “If we want to dig back through the ‘90s on comments made about women, we can certainly look to Secretary Clinton referring to Monica Lewinsky as a neurotic loony toon.” And in another MSNBC interview, Rep. Chris Collins also criticized Hillary Clinton for allegedly mistreating the women with whom Bill Clinton cheated. (In correspondence brought to light by the Free Beacon two years ago, Clinton was reported by friend Diane Blair to have referred to Lewinsky as a “narcissistic loony toon” in private.)

Rudy Giuliani has taken the line of attack one step further by referring to Clinton as “too stupid to be president” because of her husband’s affairs.
I don’t think Trump attacking Hillary over Bill is doomed to backfire but it may require a degree of deftness that Trump simply doesn’t possess. The trick is keeping Hillary’s roles as victim and accomplice distinct. It’s stupid to criticize her over the mere fact that Bill is a serial philanderer; all that’ll do is make you look boorish and drum up sympathy for her. If, though, you can make the case that she was complicit in destroying the credibility of women who accused Bill of misconduct, up to and including rape in the case of Juanita Broaddrick, then you’ve got something. That would cut to the heart of Clinton’s “girl power” shtick. Andrew Ferguson does it superbly here. Also, if Trump’s going to do this, Broaddrick has to be the central figure in the case he prosecutes because her accusations are the most gravely serious. If you toss her in as just one character in a field that includes Monica, Paula Jones, Kathleen Willey, Gennifer Flowers, and so on, it’ll muddy the message Trump wants to send. No one (much) cares if an ambitious Hillary tried to keep one of her husband’s girlfriends quiet en route to the White House, but hushing up a rape victim is a different matter. Does Trump have the discipline to stick to blaming Hillary for her own actions rather than Bill’s, and to limit his accusations to Juanita Broaddrick instead of Monica Lewinsky?

Probably not, no, but I think he’s going to attack regardless. Partly that’s because it chaps Trump’s ass, I’m sure, to have Clinton suddenly killing him over sexism towards Alicia Machado when there’s an honest-to-God rape allegation hanging over the Clintons’ heads that the wider media rarely discusses. He fancies himself a counterpuncher (he’s not, he’s really just a puncher) and Billary is begging for a counterpunch right now. Beyond that, I think Trump’s base really, really wants to see him do this whatever the eggheads on their side like Conway and Gingrich might think. Trump is the right’s id, and that id desperately craves bareknuckle warfare with the Clintons whether it’s to their strategic advantage or not. If Trump laid into Hillary onstage over Juanita Broaddrick next week for 60 seconds, Rush Limbaugh would need smelling salts the next morning. The whole appeal of Trump, in fact, is that he’s willing to go places that other Republican politicians won’t because he’s Politically Incorrect and doesn’t give a crap whether the media regards him as gauche because of it. You could argue that the entire reason you’d nominate someone like Trump is because he’s likely to throw Broaddrick and Lewinsky and Jones in Hillary’s face in front of 80 million people when Ted Cruz or Marco Rubio would pass. “He fights,” right? Well, now he gets to prove it.

But don’t forget, Clinton has proved this week that she understands Trump well enough to set a trap for him that’s got him jumping through hoops like a trained tiger. She had to have known that angering him by rubbing his face in the old Machado business would raise the risk of him firing back over Broaddrick et al. And if she’s comfortable enough with that possibility to have sprung the trap with Machado anyway, she either must have something else planned when Trump takes the bait on Bill or she has data that leads her to believe that Trump’s attacks will backfire spectacularly with women — especially when her friends in the media open fire on him in retaliation. But hey, if his sagging polls this week achieve nothing else, maybe they’ll liberate him to undertake higher-risk attacks. If he’s down 12 points in the next poll of Pennsylvania, why not pull the pin and lob the Broaddrick attack at Clinton? Maybe it’ll take Hillary down. And even if it blows up on him, he was already half-dead anyway.

Here’s Rush arguing this morning that Hillary’s the real bully towards women. See what I mean? The right wants this fight! Exit question: What does Trump say when Hillary reminds him that he’s been very sympathetic towards her over Bill’s misbehavior in the past?"
100206,1006,Giuliani: Trump will demand tonight that Obama not pardon Clinton for any legal issues before leaving office,http://hotair.com/archives/2016/09/30/giuliani-trump-will-demand-tonight-obama-not-pardon-clinton-legal-issues-leaving-office/,8,"Last night WaPo dropped yet another embarrassing scoop about Trump’s charity, noting that it’s been raising funds in New York for years but never registered with the state AG as it’s required to do by law. Reporters oohed and ahhed over the news but I think Hugh Hewitt was right: Although their dubious charity activity gives you a window onto the characters of both candidates, voters aren’t paying attention to this stuff. I think that’s because the charity reporting doesn’t tell us anything we don’t already know about the two of them. Hillary’s an establishment parasite who leverages her political influence to trade favors with powerful people. Of course the Clinton Foundation operates the way it does. Trump is an image-obsessed con man who wants to be seen as a big shot and doesn’t care what corners he cuts to do so. Of course the Trump Foundation operates the way it does. Their characters are already priced into their political stock, so the charity reporting never really changes the value.

Same deal, though, with this “no pardons!” attack, right? Reminding voters that Crooked Hillary got a free pass over Emailgate from her friends in the Justice Department is a better use of Trump’s time than tweeting about sex tapes, but I fear it’s already fully priced into Hillary Inc. She placed her own convenience over the national security of the country and got off scot free when less connected public figures would have been gone to the pen. That’s well known by now, and while it can’t hurt to remind people sporadically, which voters who stuck with her throughout the twists and turns of the FBI investigation this summer are going to flip on her now because of this? Why would O need to preemptively pardon her when the whole point of the DOJ/FBI sturm and drang of the past three months is that the fix is in and she’ll never be indicted in the first place? Comey declined to charge her, remember? It sounds like this is a roundabout way for Trump to suggest without explicitly saying that, if he wins the election, his Justice Department will indict Crooked Hillary. He hinted at that back in February, in fact; five months later, Republicans were chanting “lock her up” on the floor of the convention in Cleveland. He could complete the circle by saying now, explicitly, that he’ll charge her with mishandling classified information if he’s elected. That would be another way in which Trump channels the right’s id by throwing roundhouses at the Clintons.

But to bring this back to the point up top, which swing voter would that convince? Anyone who’s desperate to see Clinton behind bars is already a flag-waving Trump supporter. White college grads who are worried about the economy and terrorism will stop caring about Hillary Clinton five minutes after the race is called for Trump in November. And it’s simply not true that Trump would follow through on his promise to prosecute her as president. Even if he lucks out and ends up with a Congress that’s still controlled by Republicans, the GOP’s majorities in the House and Senate will be thinner than they are now. The party will need to work with Democrats to pass Trump’s agenda and trying to send the last Democratic nominee to prison won’t make that easier. It’ll also open Trump up to ferocious attacks from the left and the media that he’s politicizing the Justice Department by demanding prosecution in a case where the FBI, rightly or wrongly, has already declined to charge. Trump as president would inevitably end up deciding that, “for the good of the country” and in the spirit of national healing, it’d be best to let Hillary sink into senescent retirement out of the public eye than to have a big trial. Especially since the DOJ losing that trial would be deeply humiliating to Trump.

Instead of worrying about Obama pardoning Hillary, Trump could use tonight to reiterate his strongest argument against Clinton, the one that actually can win him votes. But why bother with that, I guess, when there’s a right-wing id to be fed? Further to that point, here’s Rush back in February exulting at the possibility of the Clintons finally facing justice in court. By the way, it’s late in the day on a Friday as I write this. Isn’t that the usual time for another highly damaging FBI document dump about Hillary? "

Doesn’t he? Or was Carl Bernstein right that Weld, a Massachusetts centrist, would end up defecting from the ticket and trying to help Clinton down the stretch if he got spooked that a Trump presidency is a real possibility?

He’s much more complimentary of Johnson in the clip below than the headline above would suggest, as you’ll see (the key line about Hillary comes near the very end), but it’s odd nonetheless for a candidate in one party to say that no one’s more qualified than a candidate from another. It’s not the only time Weld has done Hillary a solid on the trail this year either. Back in June, he told the Times that he saw nothing criminal in how she handled her email. Just two days ago, he repeated on MSNBC that Clinton is qualified to be president while Trump is not — a judgment not entirely shared by his running mate.

Gov. Johnson: I think she is gonna press the button.

Chris Matthews: What?

Gov. Johnson: Well, if confronted with that ten minutes, she will be hawkish. She will be more hawkish in that role.

Chris Matthews: You think she has a happy trigger?

Gov. Johnson: I think she won’t err on the side of not being the aggressor.
It’s no surprise Weld would be softer on Clinton than Johnson is, though. He and Hillary have known each other for more than 40 years, since their time working as congressional staffers on the House impeachment proceedings against Nixon in 1974. And Weld has always been an awkward fit for the Libertarian ticket. He’s palpably not a libertarian, so much so that he won the VP nod at the convention this year with a bare minimum of 50.5 percent of the delegates. He’s the VP pick only because he and Johnson are friends from their time as governors and Johnson wanted him as his running mate, thinking that a middle-of-the-road ticket with more governing experience than either of the two major-party candidates might get a closer look from disaffected voters. Libertarians obliged him. That’s why the rumors of Weld quitting the ticket keep circulating — his relationship with Hillary Clinton is a lot older than his relationship with the Libertarian Party.

Read A.B. Stoddard on why Hillary should be actively trying to steal Weld away from Johnson, even with the promise of a cabinet position if need be. In lieu of an exit question, I’ll pass along a thought I saw on Twitter a few days ago: Gary Johnson is the closest we’ve come to nominating “Towelie” from “South Park” for president. "

Seven days before that, grandma needed help up the stairs.

The first major party presidential candidate under FBI investigation – who had the primaries rigged in her favor by the DNC – wants to lead the free world, yet can’t manage to walk up and down without help.

Pfft.

In yet another case of, “In No Universe Should Hillary be President,” here’s video showing Clinton at today’s Florida rally looking for assistance to…wait for it…walk down the stairs. Placing Hillary in the White House would be as smart as installing a screen door on a submarine.

How can liberals so blindly support Clinton knowing she’s sick; knowing everything wrong she’s done in the past? Really tells you the type of idiocy we’re dealing with today.

At this same rally, Hillary burst into yet another coughing fit.

Also, only a few hundred people showed up to the event.

You’d think a former president and the spouse of a current presidential nominee would be front and center during the whole thing, but Slick Willie just brings along too much baggage.

The real reason why we’re not seeing more of Bill?

Infidelity.

From New York Post:

Hillary Clinton’s campaign has been reluctant to use her scandal-scarred hubby on the campaign trail due to his multiple rumored affairs, a new report says. A book by author Joe Conason reveals the constant concern Clinton advisers had about the former president and lists the names of his rumored lovers, according to The Daily Mail.

Makes sense. Bill’s history with women is not favorable for the first major party female hopeful; someone who claims she wants to help women.

Yet, Hillary can’t escape her past of silencing Bill’s accusers, so does it really matter that 42 is kept out of sight? It’s not as if progressive women seem to care about what he’s done, anyway.

100211,1008,The Debate Schedule Helps Trump,http://www.americanthinker.com/articles/2016/09/the_debate_schedule_helps_trump.html,8,"Who won the first debate on September 26?  Perhaps a better question might be which candidate performed worse.  Trump had several opportunities to score better in the debate than he did, and Hillary was her usual plastic phony self, but she avoided any real mistakes.  Give her a modest edge in this first presidential debate, but give Republicans a clear edge to do better and better in the next three.

Mike Pence is smart, pleasant, likeable, and experienced.  There is every reason to believe he will do better against Tim Kaine than Trump did against Hillary.  In fact, Pence will probably do better than Kaine on form because Pence was a successful conservative media personality on radio and television, and this experience shows in how he handles the media.

Because of the age of the two presidential candidates, voters may be more interested in the vice presidential debates than in a typical presidential election year.  Equally importantly, this vice presidential debate will give the Republican ticket an upward trajectory from the September 26 debate so that going into the second presidential debate on October 9, assuming that the format of this debate is more favorable to Trump than the first debate, Trump can push ahead of Hillary.

The October 9 debate has a town meeting format, which will allow questions to both candidates from ordinary voters.  This is the sort of format in which Trump has done well, while it should terrify Hillary.  No moderator is going to ask her about Juanita Broaddrick or Kathleen Willey or any other the other women raped or abused or terrorized by her husband while Hillary sat saying and doing nothing.  If Trump raises that subject, he could take flak, but if a woman in the audience asks about these, what can Hillary do?  Not much.

In the first debate, Trump faced the first female presidential candidate in her first debate and faced a ""person of color"" moderator who was clearly in Hillary's corner.  Lester Holt, predictably, asked Trump questions intended to show his imagined racism, and Trump could not effectively respond that Holt was focusing on those issues.  Hillary prodded Trump as a sexist (forget her husband as a rapist).  Reacting too strongly to either of these leftists could have backfired.

When ordinary Americans ask questions of candidates, this may be the first time ever that Hillary, while America watches, will have to explain the unexplainable offenses of Bill and herself against women or the obvious questions about the Clinton Foundation, the email scandal, and her endless lifetime of outright lies.  (""Mrs. Clinton, when you told America you were named in honor of Sir Edmund Hillary climbing Mt. Everest, you were lying, weren't you?"")

Hillary, who could not have sweated too much imaging what Lester Holt would ask her, may sweat a lot imaging what ordinary voters in this sort of setting may ask her.  Trump, much more than Hillary, will be more in his element.  He doesn't need to shock, but simply be real and spontaneous, two qualities Hillary utterly lacks.  While the two moderators are both confirmed leftists like Holt, they cannot moderate how questions are asked and what is actually asked by participants.

Coming out of the second presidential debate and out of the only vice presidential debate a few days earlier, the Republican ticket could easily be seen as leading the debate series 2 to 1.  The last debate is the only one with a truly neutral moderator, Chris Wallace, whose father was an icon at CBS and whose credentials cannot seriously be questioned by anyone.

While Wallace will – and should – press Trump on things he has gotten wrong or fibbed about, Wallace will also press Hillary about the things she has gotten wrong or fibbed about.  Just the email scandal and the Clinton Foundation are enough to sink any candidate forced to really answer the questions.

Hillary's public record requires her to defend a ghastly legion of calamitous and hideous failures and tacitly to endorse the grand debacle that is Obama.  What about Trump's proposed policies?  Well, Trump's ideas have yet to be tested in the White House...and Trump ought to remind voters of that on every occasion.  So here, in the last debate, with some momentum going into the vice presidential and second presidential debates, Trump, like another New Yorker at bat for the Yankees many decades ago, can point into the stands and knock one out of the ballpark.

100212,1008,Why a Terrorist Attack Could Make Trump President,http://www.americanthinker.com/articles/2016/09/why_a_terrorist_attack_could_make_trump_president.html,8,"Let’s not beat around the bush. This is no ordinary election; it’s a battle for America. We have two very different presidential candidates that are selling two very different visions of the kind of America we had in the past, the kind of America we have right now, and the kind of America we should have in the future.

In the blue corner we have Hillary Clinton, who basically wants to continue on the path we have been on for the past eight years, while acknowledging that a lot remains to be done. And in the red corner we have Donald Trump, who argues we are very much on the wrong path and that Americans -- well, a majority of Americans anyway -- were better off in the 1950s, when American-made products still ruled the global economy and blue collar workers could be part of the middle class, when American military might was unrivaled, Mexicans lived in Mexico and Muslims lived, well, somewhere else.

For the last couple of weeks, Republicans have been asking themselves in growing desperation how it is possible that Hillary Clinton is still favorite to win the election after all the lying, the private email server scandal and the air of corruption surrounding her time as Secretary of State (with aides allegedly providing access to the Secretary for big Clinton Foundation donors).

As Donald Trump Jr. put it: “They [the media] have let her slide on every indiscrepancy [sic], on every lie, on every DNC game trying to get Bernie Sanders out of this thing. If Republicans were doing that, they’d be warming up the gas chamber right now.”

The reason is this, Donald Jr.: voters don’t like Hillary Clinton, they don’t believe Hillary Clinton and they don’t trust Hillary Clinton, but there is one thing about her they know to be true: electing her will keep your dad out of the White House.

In other words, when all is said and done, this election is not about accepting Clinton and her vision for America, it is about rejecting Trump and his vision for America.

But.

There is nothing Donald Trump could do that would make him seem more trustworthy, more measured, more experienced, less confrontational, less offensive. Same goes for Clinton. Those trains have left the station.

The only thing left for Mr. Trump to do, is to convince voters that his vision for America is the right vision. That we have every reason to fear an increase of terrorist attacks if we allow Syrian refugees -- and people from other predominantly Muslim countries -- to continue to “pour into the country.” That we have grown weak, allowing our military to be hollowed out in a time we need more, not less, military might. That it is time to return to an America first policy.

Should Mr. Trump succeed in doing just that, the tables would turn and all his discrepancies would be forgotten. He would be the favorite to win, no matter what he would do or say, no matter what damaging information would surface about his past business dealings, because voters would still subscribe to his vision for America.

For that to become reality, though, something would have to happen that is so big, it would force everyone to recalibrate -- or at least consider recalibrating -- their existing world view. The kind of event that makes people say: “Look, I’ve always been against/for that policy, but after this happened I have to seriously reconsider.”

A mere political scandal or grand gesture will likely not be enough to fundamentally upset voter’s minds so late in the game. Historically, the effect of that kind of October Surprise has generally been overestimated. But when it’s something that could be sold as a real game changer, all bets are off. 

Think Pearl Harbor, which swayed American public opinion in favor of entry into World War II. The attacks of 9/11, which generated overwhelming public support for the passage of the PATRIOT Act and the ensuing wars in Afghanistan and Iraq (of course, nowadays it’s next to impossible to find anyone who admits they supported the wars back then, but in the early days public support for the war in Afghanistan was over 90 percent and for the war in Iraq over 70 percent). And the collapse of Lehman Brothers, on September 15, 2008, which turned a deadlocked presidential contest into a solid lead for Barack Obama.

If a 9/11-style terrorist attack were to happen late October, early November, in other words days before the election, how would that play out? Remember the mood during those first days, weeks following 9/11? The incidences of violence against Muslim Americans, the heightened sense of insecurity, vulnerability, nationalism, the broad support for the invasion of Afghanistan? Hold on to that.

Here are the responses of Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump just after the New York bombings of September 17, 2016.

“I have been briefed about the bombings in New York and New Jersey and the attack in Minnesota. Obviously we need to do everything we can to support our first responders, also to pray for the victims. We have to let this investigation unfold. We have been in touch with various officials, including the mayor's office in New York, to learn what they are discovering as they conduct this investigation. And I will have more to say about it when we have some facts.”

 

“This is something that will happen, perhaps, more and more all over the country. Because we’ve been weak. Our country’s been weak. We’re letting people in by the thousands and tens of thousands. We’re allowing these people to come into our country and destroy our country, and make it unsafe for people. We don’t want to do any profiling. If somebody looks like he’s got a massive bomb on his back, we won’t go up to that person ... because if he looks like he comes from that part of the world, we’re not allowed to profile. Give me a break.”

Remembering how you felt in the days after 9/11…whom would you vote for in the immediate aftermath of a terrorist attack?

Now assume you are an undecided or NeverTrumper.

Hillary Clinton cannot afford any more terror on Obama's watch. Trump's chances might just depend on it.

100213,1008,Hill on Bill’s Women: 'We Reached Out to Them',http://www.americanthinker.com/articles/2016/09/hill_on_bills_women_we_reached_out_to_them.html,8,"In a halfway honest front-page article Thursday, the Washington Post posed the following question in the headline, “Enabler or family defender? How Hillary Clinton responded to husband’s accusers.”

I say “halfway” because reporter Shawn Boburg knew the answer to his question. Hillary provided it herself during a crucial “60 Minutes” interview to which Boburg alluded more than once. That interview took place on January 26, 1992, the day America first met Hillary Clinton.

Earlier that same month, Arkansas state employee Gennifer Flowers confessed to a tabloid that she and Bill Clinton had had a 12-year affair. In a Hail Mary attempt to save Bill’s candidacy, the Clintons agreed to the interview with CBS’s Steve Kroft.

When Kroft asked Bill about the affair, he answered, “That allegation is false.” Hillary, her hands lovingly intertwined with Bill’s, nodded her approval. Of course, they were both lying, Bill with much greater skill.

At this point in the interview, Hillary explained how Flowers’s claim surfaced. “When this woman first got caught up in these charges,” she said, “I felt as I've felt about all of these women: that they had just been minding their own business and they got hit by a meteor, and it was no fault of their own.”

Hillary then followed up with the assertion that answered the Washington Post’s question: “We reached out to them. I met with two of them to reassure them they were friends of ours.” (italics added) Yes, Hillary was -- and still is -- an enabler.

Hillary did not do all her own dirty work. As the Post acknowledges, in 1992 the Clinton campaign hired private detective Jack Palladino “to investigate the accusers involved in two dozen allegations.”

At the time, the Clinton campaign was insisting that these women were being pressured to lie by tabloids waving cash. Palladino’s role, as Clinton aide Betsy Wright memorably told the Post’s Michael Isikoff in July 1992, was to manage the “bimbo eruptions.""

Among the presumed bimbos the Clinton campaign “reached out” to was a former Miss Arkansas, Sally Miller Perdue. In July 1996, Perdue appeared on the Sally Jesse Raphael show to discuss her 1983 affair with Clinton, an affair later corroborated by several Arkansas State troopers. In his article a week after Perdue’s appearance, Isikoff noted that Palladino had done a sufficiently good job smearing Perdue that “no major news organization has reported the account.”

In August 1996, still worried about Perdue’s potential to disrupt the campaign, the Clintons had Democratic party operative Ron Tucker speak to Perdue. According to Perdue, Tucker told her, “There were people in high places who were anxious about me and they wanted me to know that keeping my mouth shut would be worthwhile.”

“Worthwhile” meant a GS-11 or higher job with the federal government. If she turned down the offer and talked to the media, “He couldn't guarantee what would happen to my pretty little legs.” After harassing phone calls and damage to her car, Perdue chose to go into hiding.

Perdue was the least of the Clintons’ problems in 1992. More potentially troublesome were the women that Clinton had assaulted, Juanita Broaddrick, Elizabeth Ward Gracen, and Paula Jones among others.

This week’s Post article pulls its punches on both Jones and Broaddrick. In the Post’s account, Jones was “groped” and Broaddrick was the victim of a claimed “sexual assault.” Yes, Clinton did grope Jones, but as she would later testify under oath, “Mr. Clinton then walked over to the sofa, lowered his trousers and underwear, exposed his penis (which was erect) and told me to ‘kiss it.’""

As to Broaddrick, she was not merely assaulted. She was raped. “It was a real panicky, panicky situation,” Broaddrick told NBC’s Lisa Myers in February 1999. “I was even to the point where I was getting very noisy, you know, yelling to ‘Please stop.’ And that’s when he pressed down on my right shoulder and he would bite my lip.”

Immediately afterwards, a colleague found Broaddrick in her hotel room crying and “in a state of shock,” her pantyhose torn and her lip swollen. The Post made no mention of Hillary’s literal hands-on effort to silence Broaddrick. “She threatened me at that fundraiser,” Broaddrick said of an intimidating grip-and-grin with Hillary soon after the rape, “that’s foremost in my mind; I’ll never forget that; I’ll never forget that encounter.”

The Post article in question makes no mention of Gracen. As Iskoff reported in his 1999 book, Uncovering Clinton, Gracen had a one-off with Clinton in 1983 when Clinton was governor and she was serving as Miss America.

To assure Gracen’s silence during the 1992 campaign, Clinton campaign manager Mickey Kantor got together with Clinton’s friend and Hollywood producer, Harry Thomason, and they arranged for her to take a part in a mini-series then filming in Croatia.

There was a reason to get Gracen out of the country. Like Broaddrick, Gracen was married when she was sexually assaulted by Clinton. “It was rough sex,” Isikoff wrote, “Clinton got so carried away that he bit her lip, Gracen later told friends. But it was consensual.”

Writing before Broaddrick’s prime-time confession, Isikoff missed the lip-biting MO. He also failed to acknowledge that at least one of Gracen’s friends, Judy Stokes, had told the Paula Jones legal team that the sex was not consensual at all.

“Do you believe Clinton raped her?” investigator Rick Lambert asked her. “Absolutely,” Stokes replied. “He forced her to have sex. What do you call that?”

In April 1998, Gracen came to the embattled Clinton’s aid, this time by recanting an earlier lie that she had never had sex with Clinton. In a television interview, Gracen said of the 1983 encounter with Clinton, “What I did was wrong, and I feel very bad about it now.” Gracen denied that the sex was coerced and said almost laughably of Hillary, “I’ll apologize to her now. It was wrong.”

After her 1998 TV interview, fearing a subpoena from prosecutor Ken Starr, Gracen flew to the Caribbean where she went island hopping for several months. “She had no interest being drawn into the case,” wrote Isikoff. “She had already lied for Clinton once.”

Then as now, the media had no interest in discovering who arranged for Gracen’s faux apology or her sun-drenched flight from justice.

Despite her decades-long sexist and classist war on women, Hillary had confidence enough in the major media to tweet in November 2015, “Every survivor of sexual assault deserves to be heard, believed, and supported.”

Every survivor, that is, except Bill’s “bimbos.” Although she had yet to coin the term, Hillary had apparently assigned these women to the ranks of the “deplorable.” If clarification were needed, Clinton aide James Carville provided it on national TV in 1996. “Drag a hundred-dollar bill through a trailer park,” said Carville for the ages, “you never know what you'll find.”

100214,1009,WITNESSING THE FINAL DEMISE OF “MAINSTREAM” MEDIA,http://www.powerlineblog.com/archives/2016/09/witnessing-the-final-demise-of-mainstream-media.php,8,"If this year’s presidential election has a silver lining, it is the final demise of “mainstream media.” Which is not to say that liberal media are going away; they aren’t, of course. But liberal media’s claim to being mainstream–reliable, objective, fair, unlike fringe or partisan news sources–is gone forever. That is a good thing.

No one could follow this year’s campaign without understanding that the media formerly known as mainstream (sorry, Prince) have jettisoned any pretense of neutrality, or even of journalistic integrity, in their desperation to preserve the status quo by electing Hillary Clinton president. Fair enough. We know where they stand.

One of the last vestiges of liberal media’s pretense to authority is its legion of “fact checkers.” “Fact checkers” like PolitiFact, the Washington Post’s Glenn Kessler and others purport to rule judiciously on claims made by candidates of both parties. In fact, as those who pay attention have long known, “fact checking,” in pretty much all cases, is just liberal activism under another name.

All of which is preface to this: Rasmussen Reports finds that voters are no longer fooled, if they ever were, by newspapers’ fact checkers:

A new Rasmussen Reports national telephone and online survey finds that just 29% of all Likely U.S. Voters trust media fact-checking of candidates’ comments. Sixty-two percent (62%) believe instead that news organizations skew the facts to help candidates they support. …

Eighty-eight percent (88%) of voters who support Trump in the presidential race believe news organizations skew the facts, while most Clinton backers (59%) trust media fact-checking. Among the supporters of Libertarian Gary Johnson and Green Party candidate Jill Stein, sizable majorities also don’t trust media fact-checking.

It stands to reason that a slim majority of Democrats trust media fact-checkers. Why not trust those who are in the business of agreeing with you? What could be more objective than that?

A college friend of mine once said, “Objective is what I think. Subjective is what you think.” That sums up the fact-checker mentality very well, and after all these years, no one–not even the Democrats who purport to trust the fact-checkers–is fooled. Breitbart.com is a sort-of-conservative news source, while the New York Times is a massively liberal news source. Neither is impartial or has any inherent authority. Which one is more reliable is a case-by-case, day-by-day evaluation that is left up to the reader, and as to which there will be nothing like consensus.

If just about everyone now understands this, it is a good thing."

DETROIT NEWSPAPER ENDORSES GARY JOHNSON
The Detroit News has been around since 1873. Until now, it has never endorsed a non-Republican for president (it endorsed no one in two of FDR’s races and sat out the Bush-Kerry contest in 2004).

This year, though, the Detroit News is has endorsed Gary Johnson for president. Of Donald Trump it says:

The 2016 nominee offered by the Republican Party rubs hard against the editorial board’s values as conservatives and Americans. Donald Trump is unprincipled, unstable and quite possibly dangerous. He can not be president.

The paper seems to prefer Hillary Clinton:

Hillary Clinton, has an impressive resume and a presidential bearing. And although we disagree with her nearly across the board on the issues, we acknowledge she has the temperament to be commander-in-chief and leader of both a diverse nation and the free world.

However:

[C]haracter matters. Her career-long struggles with honesty and ethics and calculating, self-serving approach to politics trouble us deeply.

Hence, the endorsement of Johnson. According to the editors:

Johnson has excelled at public service. In his eight years as the Republican governor of New Mexico, he cut taxes while balancing the budget, and left the state in better fiscal shape than when he arrived. He also was a champion of school choice, and the state under his guidance made great strides in improving education.

Unfortunately, Johnson appears clueless when it comes to foreign policy/national security, and not just because he doesn’t know what Aleppo is and could not name a single foreign leader. Johnson wants to decrease military spending, ignore ISIS “until they attack us on U.S. soil,” eschew enhanced interrogation techniques for terrorists, close Gitmo, and abolish the NSA.

When asked whether the United States should have entered World Wars II, Johnson replied: “I don’t know.” This is not a serious guy.

As for Johnson’s running mate, William Weld, he’s a liberal Republican. Weld supported Barack Obama for president in 2008.

For me, the options this year are voting for Trump and not voting for any presidential candidate. Trump is a better option than Johnson because he has a chance to defeat Clinton and is not saddled with the libertarian ideology when it comes to foreign policy and national security.

What impact will the Detroit News’ endorsement have? The conventional wisdom, I think, is that Johnson is drawing more support from potential Clinton voters than from potential Trump voters.

However, the Detroit News is a Republican paper. Thus, I infer that its endorsement is more likely to influence potential Trump voters than potential Clinton voters.

But this assumes that its endorsement is influential. These days, I doubt that most newspaper endorsements matter."
100217,1010,The absurdity of Trump’s new war against anonymous sources,https://thinkprogress.org/trump-anonymous-sources-7f9432515952#.r38ovnadl,8,"At 3:20 a.m. Friday, Donald Trump posted a tweet denouncing the media for citing anonymous sources while reporting about him. A number of hours later, he followed that up with another smear: Trump, however, has repeatedly cited anonymous sources over the years while “reporting” things on Twitter.
Consider this tweet, which will go down in history as one of his most memorable:
Though the notion that Obama’s birth certificate is fraudulent had already been debunked by the time Trump posted that tweet, Trump continued to push the “birther” conspiracy theory for years. He finally acknowledged Obama is a U.S. citizen on September 16. Clearly in that situation Trump’s “extremely credible source” led him astray.
Trump’s birther tweet wasn’t the only time he used anonymous sources to smear Obama: Trump has also used an anonymous source to attack New York Attorney General Eric Schneiderman, who is currently investigating the Trump Foundation for fraud: More recently, Trump cited “sources” while denouncing Hillary Clinton and the allegedly rigged system working on her behalf: And when he’s not citing anonymous sources, Trump is notoriously fond of using the “many people say” formulation to substantiate his claims. Despite Trump’s attack on the media, CNN media correspondent Brian Stelter shared a couple examples of Trump aides actually asking to pass along information anonymously: A Bloomberg report published hours after Trump’s Friday morning tweets illustrates why Trump wants to discredit anonymous sources. Citing “Florida campaign workers who requested anonymity out of fear of getting fired for speaking publicly,” Bloomberg reports that “the lack of basic campaign staples such as yard signs and bumper stickers forces staff to repeatedly turn away excited Trump backers who want to show their support.”
Earlier this week, another anonymous source told NBC that Trump is considering a major campaign shakeup because his current brain trust is hurting the Trump Organization’s bottom line: Is the media making all of this information up? It seems unlikely. More probable is that Trump’s “there are no sources” claim is just another fib illustrating his fast and loose relationship with the truth.
It’s information that portrays him in an unflattering light, rather than anonymous sources themselves, that Trump wants to discredit."
100218,1010,"Donald Trump praises Angela Merkel, months after saying she is ‘ruining’ Germany",https://thinkprogress.org/trump-merkel-aaf93930ec5a#.lqfms18lr,8,"Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump said on Thursday that Germany’s Chancellor Angela Merkel was the foreign leader he admires and would like to emulate.
The news comes as a surprise considering how often he’s criticized Merkel during the course of his campaign, including her decision to accept thousands of refugees into Germany.
“Well, I think Merkel is a really great world leader, but I was very disappointed that_—_when she_—_this move with the whole thing on immigration,” Trump said on Thursday. “I was always a Merkel person, I thought really fantastic, but I think she made a very tragic mistake a year-and-a-half ago.”
It’s unclear why Trump wants to emulate a foreign leader who was nominated for the Nobel Peace Prize for her work settling refugees in Europe. But this isn’t the first time Trump has praised her.
“Germany’s like sitting back silent collecting money and making a fortune with probably the greatest leader in the world today, Merkel,” he told TIME last year. “She’s fantastic. Highly respected.”
After Merkel was nominated as TIME Magazine’s Person of the Year, Trump tweeted that she was “ruining” Germany. Merkel was criticized in July of last year when she responded to a young Palestinian girl’s plea against deportation with “politics is sometimes hard.” But shortly after, Merkel opened Germany’s borders to migrants and refugees. She’s since been fighting to get Europe to accept refugee resettlement, at home and throughout the continent, particularly in eastern Europe, where leaders have stoked anti-Muslim and xenophobic sentiment against the refugees.
Trump, who has repeatedly called for a ban on Muslims entering the United States, has used her acceptance of refugees and migrants as a stick to swipe at Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton. “Hillary Clinton wants to be America’s Angela Merkel, and you know what a disaster this massive immigration has been to Germany and the people of Germany. Crime has risen to levels that no one thought would they would ever see,” Trump said in August. “We have enough problems in our country, we don’t need another one.”
For her part, Clinton also said she admires Merkel on Thursday. “I think she has been an extraordinary, strong leader during difficult times in Europe,” Clinton said aboard the campaign plane. She added that she likes “a lot of world leaders” but that Merkel was “one of my favorites.”
On Wednesday, Libertarian candidate Gary Johnson was asked a similar question. He struggled to name a single foreign leader and said he was having an “Aleppo moment,” referencing an earlier interview when he seemed to never have heard of the destruction and humanitarian crisis in Syria’s largest city. After stumbling for a bit and receiving help from his vice presidential candidate, former Massachusetts Governor Bill Weld, he landed on Vicente Fox, Mexico’s president from 2000 to 2006. Weld, however, also said his favorite foreign leader was Angela Merkel. "
100219,1010,Trump starts his day with some slut-shaming,https://thinkprogress.org/donald-trump-slut-shames-alicia-machado-212431ae93fc#.p2lcp5q7x,8,"On both Wednesday and Thursday, the Trump campaign distributed talking points to surrogates directing them to speak negatively about former Miss Universe Alicia Machado, who Hillary Clinton brought up during Monday night’s debate as an example of how Trump has treated women poorly.
Friday morning, Trump took matters into his own hands.
In a string of tweets published between 5:15 and 5:30 a.m. ET, Trump smeared Machado as “disgusting,” and encouraged people who think otherwise to “check out sex tape.” Those tweets would be strange enough if they were accurate, but they don’t even rise to that standard. As the Daily Beast reported, “The alleged ‘sex tape’ Trump urged followers to ‘check out’ is non-explicit footage from a Spanish reality-TV show in which the Venezuelan model supposedly had sex with a fellow participant.” A separate Daily Beast report notes that “there does not appear to be any evidence suggesting the existence of professionally made pornography starring Machado.”
The unproven notion that Machado is a porn star was pushed this week by the Infowars website run by conspiracy theorist Alex Jones. In a post published Wednesday, InfoWars called Machado “literally a porn star.” Their evidence? A link to a screengrab of a porn video featuring a woman who looks vaguely like Machado.
 Late last month, Jones revealed that he’s been advising Trump.
Earlier this week, Machado told reporters that watching the political rise of Trump_—_who called her “Miss Piggy,” “Miss Housekeeping,” and an “eating machine” after her Miss Universe win in 1996_—_is like “a bad dream.”
During an appearance on Fox News the morning following the debate, Trump said Machado’s weight gain after his Miss Universe win was a “real problem” for the Miss Universe pageant. During another Fox News appearance with Bill O’Reilly the next evening, he praised himself for doing the right thing by saving Machado’s job after she “put on so much weight.”
On Wednesday, Trump surrogate Newt Gingrich defended Trump’s handling of the matter, telling a room full of people at a Log Cabin Republicans event that “you’re not supposed to gain 60 pounds during the year that you’re Miss Universe.” Machado_—_who has spoken openly about relapsing into bulimia after Trump publicly shamed her_—_is from Venezuela, but recently become a U.S. citizen. In an interview with ThinkProgress in June, she said she became motivated to do so after Trump became the Republican Party’s presumptive presidential nominee.
“It was like a great monster reappearing in my life,” Machado said. “In the beginning, I thought there was no way this loco will ever win. But after the primaries I realized I need to vote. I can’t invite my community to step up if I won’t do it myself.”
UPDATE: Machado has responded to Trump’s smears. In an Instagram post written in Spanish, she says, “The Republican candidate and his campaign team are again generating attacks, insults and trying to revive slanders and false accusations about my life. All this in order to intimidate, humiliate me and throw me off balance again.”
“Through his campaign of hate, the Republican candidate insists on discrediting and demoralizing women, which is definitely one of his most terrifying characteristics,” she adds. “I will continue standing up and sharing my story, my absolute support for Mrs. Clinton in the name of women, my sisters, aunts, grandmothers, cousins, friends and the feminist community.” Meanwhile, a LawNewz post makes a case that Trump’s sex tape smear could actually open him up to a defamation lawsuit.
“The most actionable statement, from a defamation standpoint, is the allegation that Machado was in a sex tape. It’s clearly a statement of purported fact, and was clearly made publicly,” Elura Nanos writes. 
“As a model and actress, Machado could easily suffer damage to her reputation and resulting financial consequences from the publicizing of that statement.”

100220,1002,Trump Unloads in Pennsylvania Speech: Hillary Clinton ‘Should Be in Prison’,http://www.breitbart.com/big-government/2016/10/01/trump-unloads-in-pennsylvania-speech-hillary-clinton-should-be-in-prison/,9,"NEW YORK CITY, New York — In a lengthy speech on Saturday night in Manheim, Pennsylvania, Republican nominee for president Donald J. Trump lambasted his opponent Democratic nominee Hillary Rodham Clinton for a secret tape recording of her bashing supporters of Sen. Bernie Sanders of Vermont—and even called for Clinton to be placed in prison and questioned as to whether she has been loyal to her husband former President Bill Clinton.
Trump said in the speech on Saturday night:

A new audio tape that has surfaced just yesterday from another one of Hillary’s high roller fundraisers shows her demeaning and mocking Bernie Sanders and all of his supporters. You know, and I’ll tell you something we have a much bigger movement that Bernie Sanders ever had. We have much bigger crowds than Sanders ever had. And we have a more important movement than Bernie Sanders ever had because we’re going to save our country, okay? We’re going to save our country. But I can tell you Bernie Sanders would have left a great, great legacy had he not made the deal with the devil. He would have really left a great legacy. Now he shows up and 120 people come in to hear him talk. Bernie Sanders would have left a great legacy had he not made the deal, had he held his head high and walked away. Now he’s on the other side perhaps from us and we want to get along with everybody and we will—we’re going to unite the country—but what Bernie Sanders did to his supporters was very, very unfair. And they’re really not his supporters any longer and they’re not going to support Hillary Clinton. I really believe a lot of those people are coming over and largely because of trade, college education, lots of other things—but largely because of trade, they’re coming over to our side—you watch, you watch. Especially after Hillary mocks him and mocks all of those people by attacking him and his supporters as ‘living in their parents’ basements,’ and trapped in dead-end careers. That’s not what they are.

Also in his speech on Saturday night, Trump summed up exactly what came out in the latest Hillary Clinton tapes in which she mocks Sanders supporters:

She describes many of them as ignorant, and [that] they want the United States to be more like Scandinavia but that ‘half the people don’t know what that means’ in a really sarcastic tone because she’s a sarcastic woman. To sum up, and I’ll tell you the other thing—she’s an incompetent woman. She’s an incompetent woman. I’ve seen it. Just take a look at what she touches. It never works out, and you watch: her run for the presidency will never ever work out because we can’t let it work out. To sum up, Hillary Clinton thinks Bernie supporters are hopeless and ignorant basement dwellers. Then, of course, she thinks people who vote for and follow us are deplorable and irredeemable. I don’t think so. I don’t think so. We have the smartest people, we have the sharpest people, we have the most amazing people, and you know in all of the years of this country they say, even the pundits—most of them aren’t worth the ground they’re standing on, some of that ground could be fairly wealthy but ground, but most of these people say they have never seen a phenomenon like is going on. We have crowds like this wherever we go. Later in the speech, Trump came back to the tape again and hammered her once more for it.

“Hillary Clinton all but said that most of the country is racist, including the men and women of law enforcement,” Trump said. “She said that the other night. Did anybody like Lester Holt? Did anybody question her when she said that? No, she said it the other night. [If] you’re not a die hard Clinton fan—you’re not a supporter—from Day One, Hillary Clinton thinks you are a defective person. That’s what she’s going around saying.”

In the speech, Trump questioned whether Clinton has the moral authority to lead when she considers the majority of Americans—Trump supporters and Sanders supporters—to be “defective” people. And he went so far as saying that Clinton “should be in prison.” He went on:

How on earth can Hillary Clinton try to lead this country when she has nothing but contempt for the people who live in this country? She’s got contempt. First of all, she’s got so many scandals and she’s been caught cheating so much. One of the worst things I’ve ever witnessed as a citizen of the United States was last week when the FBI director was trying so hard to explain how she away with what she got away with, because she should be in prison. Let me tell you. She should be in prison. She’s being totally protected by the New York Times and the Washington Post and all of the media and CNN—Clinton News Network—which nobody is watching anyway so what difference does it make? Don’t even watch it. But she’s being protected by many of these groups. It’s not like do you think she’s guilty? They’ve actually admitted she’s guilty. And then she lies and lies, 33,000 emails deleted, bleached, acid-washed! And then they take their phones and they hammer the hell out of them. How many people have acid washed or bleached a Tweet? How many?

He returned to the secret Clinton tape a little while later:

Hillary Clinton slanders and attacks anyone who wants to put America First, whether they are Trump Voters or Bernie Voters. What she said about Bernie voters amazing. Like the European Union, she wants to erase our borders and she wants to do it for her donors and she wants people to pour into country without knowing who they are.

Trump later bashed the media as “dishonest as hell” when calling on the reporters at his event to “turn your cameras” to show the crowd that came to see him.

“If they showed the kind of crowds we have—which people can hear, you know it’s interesting: you can hear the crowd when you hear the television but if they showed the crowd it would be better television, but they don’t know much about that. But it would actually be better television,” Trump said.

Trump also questioned whether Hillary Clinton has been loyal to her husband, former President Bill Clinton. Bill Clinton has been known to cheat on Hillary Clinton with a variety of mistresses and has been accused of rape and sexual assault by some women.

“Hillary Clinton’s only loyalty is to her financial contributors and to herself,” Trump said. “I don’t even think she’s loyal to Bill, if you want to know the truth. And really, folks, really: Why should she be, right? Why should she be?”

Throughout the speech, Trump weaved together references to his new campaign theme about Clinton—“Follow The Money”—with details about the Trans Pacific Partnership (TPP) trade deal. He said:

We’re going to take on the corrupt media, the powerful lobbyists and the special interests that have stolen your jobs, your factories, and your future—that’s exactly what’s happened. We’re going to stop Hillary Clinton from continuing to raid the industry from your state for her profit. Hillary Clinton has collected millions of dollars from the same global corporations shipping your jobs and your dreams to other countries. You know it and everybody else knows it. That’s why Clinton, if she ever got the chance, would 100 percent approve Trans Pacific Partnership—a total disastrous trade deal. She called the deal the ‘gold standard.’ The TPP will bring economic devastation to Pennsylvania and our campaign is the only chance to stop that and other bad things that are happening to our country. She lied about the Gold Standard the other night at the debate. She said she didn’t say it—she said it. We want to stop the Trans Pacific Partnership and if we don’t—remember this, if we don’t stop it, billions and billions [of dollars] in jobs and wealth will be vacuumed right out of Pennsylvania and sent to these other countries. Just like NAFTA was a disaster, this will be a disaster. Frankly I don’t think it’ll be as bad as NAFTA. It can’t get any worse than that—signed by Bill Clinton. All of us here in this massive room here tonight can prevent this from happening. Together we can stop TPP and we can end the theft of American jobs and prosperity.

Trump praised Sanders for being strongly opposed to the TPP:

I knew one man—I’m not a big fan—but one man who knew the dangers of the TPP was Bernie Sanders. Crazy Bernie. He was right about one thing, only one thing, and that was trade. He was right about it because he knew we were getting ripped off, but he wouldn’t be able to do anything about it. We’re going to do a lot about it. We’re going to have those highways running the opposite direction. We’re going to have a lot of trade, but it’s going to come into our country. We are going to start benefitting our country because right now it’s one way road to trouble. Our jobs leave us, our money leaves us. With Mexico, we get the drugs—they get the cash—it’s that simple.

Hillary Clinton, Trump noted, is “controlled by global special interests.”

“She’s on the opposite side of Bernie on the trade issue,” Trump said. “She’s totally on the opposite side of Bernie.”

He circled back to trade a bit later in the more-than-hour-long speech, hammering TPP and Clinton cash connections. Trump continued:

Three TPP member countries gave between $6 and $15 million to Clinton. At least four lobbyists who are actively lobbying for TPP passage have raised more than $800,000 for her campaign. I’m just telling you Pennsylvania, we’re going to make it. We’re going to make it. We’re going to make it if we have Pennsylvania for sure. It’ll be easy. But you cannot let this pass. NAFTA passed. It’s been the worst trade deal probably ever passed, not in this country but anywhere in the world. It cleaned out New England. It cleaned out big portions of Pennsylvania. It cleaned out big portions of Ohio and North Carolina and South Carolina—you can’t let it happen.

Trump even called the politicians like Clinton “bloodsuckers” who have let America be drained out of millions upon millions of jobs.

“These bloodsuckers want it to happen,” Trump said. “They’re politicians that are getting taken care of by people that want it to happen. Other countries want it to happen because it’s good for them, but it’s not good for us. So hopefully you’re not going to let it happen. Whatever Hillary’s donors want, they get. They own her. On Nov. 8, we’re going to end Clinton corruption. Hillary Clinton, dishonest person, is an insider fighting for herself and for her friends. I’m an outsider fighting for you. And by the way, just in case you’re not aware, I used to be an insider but I thought this was the right thing to do. This is the right thing to do, believe me.”"
100221,1002,Tancredo: Good Thing Crony Capitalists Oppose Trump,http://www.breitbart.com/big-government/2016/10/01/tancredo-good-thing-crony-capitalists-oppose-trump/,9,"As sure as the sun rises in the east, crony capitalists know who butters their bread each day, and in 2016, they are rallying to support the Clinton dynasty and block the Trump insurgency.
A recent headline trumpeted the result of a survey among the “Fortune 500” executives: “Not one of the top Fortune 100 CEO’s supports Donald Trump.”

The story was curiously silent on how many of those top 100 corporate leaders support Hillary Clinton, but Americans are supposed to be alarmed that not one of them supports Trump.

Really? C’mon, man: most Americans will find that news reassuring, not alarming.
Why anyone should be surprised at Clinton’s support among top corporate leaders is a mystery.

The party of Big Government will always have good friends in Big Business, especially in those industries highly dependent on continued government largesse.

Yet, apparently, the major media believe their own propaganda, that the Republican party is the party of big business, which is a myth that expired at least two generations ago.

Anyone half awake knows that for decades, Big Business has been playing both sides, giving money and endorsements to the party they think will win. “Access” is the name of the game, and it has nothing to do with business principles but a lot to do with corporate interests.

Crony capitalists are expert at buying access because that’s the key to corporate profits in an economy highly dependent on government spending.

Do you think Safeway wants to see a cut in food stamps? Does WalMart want to see high tariffs on Chinese goods? Are the big banks who have survived Dodd-Franks going to welcome with open arms new policies to encourage a revival of healthy, thriving community banks? Does Big Agriculture welcome a cut in ethanol subsidies to corn growers?

The answers to those questions are no, no, and hell no. So, it’s not news that very few CEOs in those industries are supporting Donald Trump. We should see corporate America’s opposition to Trump as a sign of hope: Did we expect crony capitalism to be defanged and defunded without resistance?

To be sure, not every successful business leader is a crony capitalist, dependent on access to friends in government to help get that next government contract. And let’s admit that the term as it is used today lacks precision. The term is often used by the left to denigrate and smear all business success.

The problem is that our economy has become so intertwined with government that it is often hard to separate the two. The question is, do we want more of that “business-government partnership” or less? Crony capitalists want more, a lot more.

Much of corporate America’s fear of Donald Trump is based on the uncertainty created by talk of cutting those intimate ties. Many corporate CEO’s worry that Trump might be serious about dismantling the federal regulatory apparatus that today absorbs over $2.1 trillion in compliance costs.

If you’ve ever been a candidate for public office, you have probably had a personal experience with the network of corporate political action committees and semi-secret groups that try to influence elections– and not always on the side of taxpayer protections. In the 2014 gubernatorial race in Colorado, a cabal of business leaders arranged for a sizeable amount of laundered out-of-state money to purchase radio advertising attacking my candidacy.

More recently, a group led by a former Republican Governor funded primary election challenges to incumbent Republican legislators who had dared to rock the boat — they called it “grandstanding”– in ways they disapproved. Oddly, they did not fund challenges to a single incumbent Democrat legislator.

Many of those same corporate leaders are found among the backers of Hillary Clinton’s White House bid. While we think such support for the progressive Democrat agenda is shameful, we should not be surprised by it. Crony capitalism is notoriously nonpartisan and bipartisan, and that is why it is so entrenched and so powerful.

The Trump candidacy is a frontal assault on the crony capitalism that has led us into a no-growth economy, a $19 trillion national debt, the blind export of millions of middle-class jobs, and an addiction to deficit spending that extends to state governments as well as the federal octopus.

Are you one of the hundred million Americans who thinks, “Thank goodness my state constitution requires a balanced budget– my state is not in the mess we see in the federal budget!”

Well, my friend, take a closer look at your state budget. What percentage of total state spending comes from “federal dollars”? That budget number will be staggering.

In fact, you may have one or two state agencies funded 90 percent  or more by federal tax dollars. States are becoming mere administrative units of the federal bureaucracy– in health care, energy, transportation, education and more.

Now, ask yourself: Is the typical Fortune 500 CEO or “Colorado 100” or “Connecticut 100” CEO losing any sleep over the fiscal mess we are in? No? Should we trust the country’s future and our grandchildren’s freedom to the candidates they endorse?

Crony capitalism is as economically insidious as it is morally abhorrent. It will not be derailed and defeated by Chamber of Commerce complacency or coalitions of multimillionaires whose children are protected by a safety net called a trust fund.

Our nation’s destiny is not the property of the crony capitalists; it is not theirs to sell or trade in the “global marketplace.” It belongs to us, the American people– sometimes known as the American electorate.

Donald Trump is far from the perfect candidate, and as a businessman, he has at times engaged in business practices required by the corporate culture he inherited. But a man is known by both his friends and the enemies he makes, and in 2016, Trump has made exactly the right kind of enemies.

I for one am thankful that those Fortune 500 and Colorado Chamber of Commerce crony capitalists take him seriously enough to publicly oppose him."
100222,1002,Cher: Millennials ‘Don’t Trust’ Hillary Clinton Because Her ‘Sins Are Really Enormous’,http://www.breitbart.com/big-hollywood/2016/10/01/cher-millennials-dont-trust-hillary-clinton-because-her-sins-are-really-enormous/,9,"While speaking at the One Young World Summit in Ottawa, Canada, singer and social justice activist Cher slammed Donald Trump as a “dangerous” political figure and said young voters are not “drawn to Hillary” Clinton because they don’t “trust her.”
“I don’t know how he’s a candidate, he is so dangerous, and what he brings to my country, what he’s awakened in my country, is bigotry and distrust and a certain kind of supremacy in certain groups, and he lies,” Cher said of the Republican presidential nominee.

“He’s amazing, he tells something and then you go back and see what he’s said and it seems like the truth both times, he’s so terrific at lying,” the singer added. “I’ve never seen anyone so good, it’s amazing. I could go on and on on this subject forever because I’m so traumatized by him. I am truly traumatized by him.”

Cher, however, saved her more sobering criticisms for Clinton.

“It’s not easy, because especially millennials—they’re not drawn to Hillary; they don’t trust her, they feel that her sins are really enormous,” Cher said according to the Daily Mail.

“If you delve into some of the things she’s being accused of—she’s screwed up and that’s for sure.” According to CNN, “Clinton is under-performing with millennials.”

The Oscar-winning actress, did, however, suggest that Clinton would “do her best” should she win in November.

“But I’ve known her for a long time and I think that she will do her best. And she’s a politician but she will do her best. If you look at her from the beginning of her life till now, she’s worked hard for people.”

Cher’s commentary at the humanitarian-focused confab was meant to spotlight her various animal right efforts. But the singer’s remarks constantly veered into presidential politics.

Warning millennial voters, Cher said, “They need to know is that this election will change America and have consequences for the world for 40 years and the people who will suffer the most are millennials.”

“And they will suffer because the people he will bring with him will put an end to any hope that women have of getting the rights we had in Roe v Wade. I believe they will put an end to any gay marriage. They will put an end to gay adoption. They will put an end to so many services that we do for the old, the young, the starving,” she added.

Cher continued: “I would say that it has such far-reaching consequences and—look, it’s not going to hurt me, I’m 70, it’s not going to do anything to me—it’s going to do stuff to young people and that really scares me and it bothers me.”

Not known to shy away from sharing her thoughts on Trump’s political rise, Cher called the real estate magnate a “f*cking idiot” and compare Trump to Hitler during a fundraiser for Clinton in August.

During the animal rights-centered event in Canada, Cher also turned her ire toward Trump’s son’s, Donald Trump, Jr., and Eric Trump, who caused controversy after posting a photo showing them celebrating the killing of a leopard they hunted during a trip to Africa.

“Donald Trump’s sons, there’s a picture of them holding a dead leopard. And I think that when that kind of message is sent from people who are influential, it’s the exact wrong message,” Cher said. “It changes the mindset of people, they become numb to what’s going on.”"
100223,1003,Will Distrust of Hillary Cause People to Vote against their Own Interests?,http://www.huffingtonpost.com/peter-d-rosenstein/will-distrust-of-hillary_b_12286694.html?utm_hp_ref=politics,9,"It is mind-boggling that some people will consider voting against their own best interest because of what they say is ‘distrust’ of Hillary. I know gay people who will vote for Trump knowing the Party whose principles they claimed to support is gone. These few people are hopeless and not even worth trying to convince otherwise. They are willing to vote for the candidate running on the most anti-gay Platform ever written. The candidate committed to nominating judges who will vote to take away any gains the LGBT community has made. Supporting a homophobic, xenophobic, sexist, racist, bully says as much about them as the candidate.

Those who I would like to understand better are represented by three young women interviewed by Nicole Wallace for the Today Show last Thursday morning. Three apparently very bright young women, moms, in North Carolina who said they watched the debate and thought Hillary did much better but had not yet made up their minds who to vote for.

One said Donald Trump’s healthcare plan would destroy her ability to get insurance and take care of her child who has diabetes. She is a single mom and said Donald Trump has no idea what life is like for her living from paycheck to paycheck. Wallace asked her what there was about Hillary that she wouldn’t commit her vote to her now. Her response was “she didn’t quite ‘trust’ her” and mentioned her emails. She said she hoped to make up her mind before she had to vote but may only decide when actually casting her ballot.

Wallace should have asked her ‘what impact Hillary Clinton’s private email server had on her family and could any impact compare with losing her and her child’s health insurance’? A good question would have been ‘Is there anything about electing a highly qualified woman, one who has brought up her own child, and is now a grandmother, that resonates with her’?

Then I would like to question every millennial who says they may vote for a third Party candidate because they ‘distrust’ Hillary. It would be interesting to ask them how they have come to distrust Hillary so much. Was it 25 years and a billion dollars of Republican attacks? Was it the email server? Then I would ask them the same question, how Hillary’s use of the private email server impacted your life?

It could be instructive to ask every millennial to make a list of the issues that concern them? What are their key issues? Is there anything Donald Trump says that meets the needs they have?

If they say they are voting for either Gary Johnson or Jill Stein I would ask if they know their platforms. Do they know the policies they have recommended? Without knowing for sure it would surprise me if most know where those candidates stand on most issues they care about. In many cases the candidates haven’t said.

From listening to millennials I know I would want to ask if the candidate they intend to vote for has promised to work towards; making college free for some and debt free for others; lowering interest rates on student loans; raising the minimum wage; rebuilding the nation’s infrastructure; toward universal healthcare; or fighting climate change?

This ‘distrust’ of Hillary has reached epic proportions but what is it really based on. Yes the current email issue is a self-inflicted one which took Hillary too long to apologize for. But she has now and the fact is her use of the private email server has never been shown to have hurt one individual or the nation in any way.

The old so-called ‘scandals’ which are really ancient history to most millennials; Whitewater, Travelgate, and even accusing her of murdering Vince Foster, have all been investigated and shown Hillary did nothing wrong. So I congratulate the Republican Party for so thoroughly smearing a decent person that now nearly 58% think she isn’t trustworthy.

To women and millennials I ask again you take the time to think about all the issues important to you. Those that will impact your life and that of your friends and family. Make that list and check every item off for each candidate. I am 100% positive you will see only Hillary Clinton has worked on all the issues you care about. She has done so successfully in the past and has made a commitment to continue to work on them and has delineated clear policies to make progress.

Don’t let some amorphous ‘distrust’ get you to vote against your own best interests. If you end up helping to elect Donald Trump you will live to regret it."
100224,1003,Dump Chump Trump,http://www.huffingtonpost.com/william-astore/dump-chump-trump_b_12282534.html?utm_hp_ref=politics,9,"What kind of a presidential candidate tweets in the middle of the night about alleged sex tapes involving a former Miss Universe winner?  Indeed, what kind of a man does this?

Donald Trump is a chump.  I’d call him a chimp, except it would be an insult to chimpanzees everywhere.  The man has no discipline, no sense of decorum, and no compassion for others (let’s not forget his signature line, “You’re fired”).  Indeed, he seems to revel in humiliating others.  This was mildly amusing when he was taking on equals on the stage during the Republican primaries, but it’s disturbing in the extreme to see him bullying the little guys and gals for whom he’s supposedly a champion.

So many sane people and major newspapers have gone on record as being against Trump that there’s little I can add.  Sadly, Trump’s followers seem unperturbed and undisturbed no matter his insults and tyrannical behavior.

All I can say is this: Trump is not the kind of man my father taught me to be.  My dad, who fought forest fires in Oregon in the CCC, a veteran of an armored division in World War II, a city firefighter for more than 30 years until his retirement, treated people fairly and squarely. He was humble about himself and considerate to others.  I can’t recall him insulting others, certainly not in the intentional and hurtful way that Trump directs at others.  Trump is especially fond of attacking women or minorities or anyone he sees as vulnerable, the very opposite of my dad’s code of behavior.

Don’t get me wrong: my dad wasn’t perfect.  He had his faults.  But his faults were not directed at others; he didn’t try to demean or diminish other people, as Trump so obviously enjoys doing.  Unlike Trump, my dad wasn’t boastful; indeed, three favorite sayings of his were: “Still waters run deep,” “Don’t toot your own horn,” and “The empty barrel makes the most noise.”

You were right, Dad.  The rushing nonsense from Trump exhibits his shallowness; the man is constantly tweeting his own horn; and, like the empty vessel that he is, he makes an awful amount of noise.

Trump: Not the kind of man my father would respect; not the kind of man our country needs.

Dump chump Trump."
100225,1003,The Great American Spin Machine,http://www.huffingtonpost.com/eli-zaretsky/the-great-american-spin-m_b_12281506.html?utm_hp_ref=politics,9,"It is an awesome experience to watch the great American spin machine at work. It is not so much that its message — “vote for Hillary; Trump is deeply flawed” — is incorrect, although it is scarcely presented in a manner that is precise, nuanced or in any way illuminating. Rather, what is striking is that beneath that lies another message, the real one, which is: do not think, do not analyze, go along with the group, our side is the greatest, USA, USA.

The New York Times this morning has eight front-page articles explaining that Donald Trump is a moron, racist, fat-shamer, misogynist — you name it. This is not overkill; it is group think. It’s very similar to what goes on in junior high schools, and it has a different purpose than merely convincing us about Trump.

Consider that this great spin machine, this huge apparatus for producing consent, did not begin with Trump as its target but rather with Sanders. Its purpose was to define what was acceptable politics and what was not. Think about Krugman, the martinet of the liberal minions, who tried to destroy Sanders with graduate school technicalities in economic theory. The underlying point was not to hurt Sanders but to defend a supposed expertise, which is to say a whole system of authority and power.

Once the Sanders threat was dispelled, unanimity against Trump became all the more compelling. The issues associated with Sanders — illegitimate power of wealth — and those associated with Trump — the white poor, relations with Russia — were all swept away. Who but a bigot would deal with Putin?

When have we seen this kind of group think before? Most obviously after 9/11. “People of good will” all agreed that 9/11 was terrible, terrible. Anyone who tried to think in a more complex way — Susan Sontag, Mary Beard — was not only wrong, they were bad. We know what 9/11 led to. The U.S. invasion of Iraq has produced more refugees than any action since World War Two, and no end in sight.

Another example is anti-Communism. Communism was equated with Nazism, domestic reform was stymied, and the U.S. declared itself the arbiter for every political question anywhere in the world — a position known as “American exceptionalism.” Critics often wound up in jail.

9/11 was terrible; Communism was wrong; Trump is highly problematic. That is not the point. The point is that group-think destroys critical thought. Of course, my critics will say “now is the time to unite against the terrible Trump danger — later, after Hillary wins, will be the time to argue about American foreign policy or the power of the banks.” But this is wrong. It asks us to surrender at the beginning of a takeover, without even waiting for the end.

If one simply assents to the anti-Trump verities today, one will later find oneself powerless to resist the new wars, the new power grabs and the new forms of debt-bondage, which follow inevitably in Clinton’s wake. The sad fate of Bernie Sanders makes this clear. Resist now or you will forever lose your voice."
100226,1005,Bombshell New York Times Report Reveals Details From Donald Trump's 1995 Tax Records,http://www.motherjones.com/politics/2016/10/donald-trump-1995-tax-records-new-york-times,9,"The New York Times dropped a bombshell of an investigation Saturday night when it published fragments from Donald Trump's 1995 tax return.

Tax experts hired by the Times said that the $916 million dollars in operating losses listed by Trump in the 1995 document may have allowed him to avoid paying federal taxes over a possible 18-year period.

A lawyer for Donald Trump threatened the Times with ""prompt initiation of appropriate legal action,"" declaring the publication of the GOP nominee's records illegal. Trump's campaign itself responded to the report by issuing a statement that read, in part: ""Mr. Trump has paid hundreds of millions of dollars in property taxes, sales and excise taxes, real estate taxes, city taxes, state taxes, employee taxes and federal taxes."" More detail here:

The $916 million loss certainly could have eliminated any federal income taxes Mr. Trump otherwise would have owed on the $50,000 to $100,000 he was paid for each episode of ""The Apprentice,"" or the roughly $45 million he was paid between 1995 and 2009 when he was chairman or chief executive of the publicly traded company he created to assume ownership of his troubled Atlantic City casinos. Ordinary investors in the new company, meanwhile, saw the value of their shares plunge to 17 cents from $35.50, while scores of contractors went unpaid for work on Mr. Trump's casinos and casino bondholders received pennies on the dollar.

""He has a vast benefit from his destruction"" in the early 1990s, said one of the experts, Joel Rosenfeld, an assistant professor at New York University's Schack Institute of Real Estate. Mr. Rosenfeld offered this description of what he would advise a client who came to him with a tax return like Mr. Trump's: ""Do you realize you can create $916 million in income without paying a nickel in taxes?""

The Times says the documents were mailed to one of its reporters. The envelope's return address, according to the Times, claimed it was sent from Trump Tower. Each of the pages sent to the newspaper listed the names and social security numbers for Trump and his then-partner, Marla Maples. The Times then verified the documents with Jack Mitnick, who handled Trump's tax returns at the time.

Trump has continually refused to release his tax returns, and the issue came up again during last Monday's presidential debate. Trump regularly defends himself by saying that an IRS audit prevents him from releasing the records. (The IRS says Trump is free to make his documents public.)"
100227,1006,Hillary Clinton: Sanders’ revolution is a ‘false promise’ of free everything for the inexperienced,http://hotair.com/archives/2016/10/01/hillary-clinton-sanders-revolution-false-promise-free-everything-inexperienced/,9,"Leaked audio of a Hillary Clinton fundraiser that took place back in February is circulating today on social media. In the clip Hillary Clinton makes the case that a lot of Bernie Sanders’ supporters are young people buying into a false promise of free stuff and a political revolution that will never come.

The clip was originally published Tuesday by the Washington Free Beacon in a story focusing on another issue discussed at the fundraiser. The quote about Sanders’ supporters got picked up today and simplified on Twitter with the hashtag #BasementDwellers. Here’s the clip and Hillary’s comments about the right and left start around 7:20: There is a…a strain of, on the one hand, the kind of populist, nationalist, xenophobic, discriminatory kind of approach that we hear too much of from the Republican candidates. And on the other side, there’s a just a deep desire to believe that, you know, we can have free college, free healthcare, that what we’ve done hasn’t gone far enough and we just need to, you know, go as far as, you know, Scandinavia, whatever that means, and half the people don’t know what that means, but it’s something that they deeply feel.

So as a friend of mine said the other day, I am occupying from the center-left to the center-right and I don’t have much company there. Because it is difficult when you’re running to be president and you understand how hard the job is. I don’t want to over-promise. I don’t want to tell people things that I know we cannot do. I want to level with the American people…and be very clear about the progress I think we can make.
Later on in the clip (about 24:30) Hillary talked in more detail about Sanders’ supporters, describing them as inexperienced people living in their parent’s basements and falling for the “false promise” of a political revolution. (Note: I haven’t transcribed this completely but missing portions are indicated by ellipses):

Some are new to politics completely, they’re children of the great recession and they are living in their parent’s basement. They feel they got their education and the jobs that are available to them are not at all what they envisioned for themselves. And they don’t see much of a future…That is a mindset that is really affecting their politics. And so if you’re feeling that you’re consigned to being a barista or some other job that doesn’t pay a lot and doesn’t have much of a ladder of opportunity attached to it then the idea that maybe, just maybe, you could be part of a political revolution is pretty appealing…

We’ve got ideals, we’ve got big goals but we also believe that the path to progress is one that you just have to get up everyday and work on. You have to make it your life’s work if you do this full time. You have to make it part of your civic responsibility for others and just keep making that case. It’s not as glamorous. It’s not as exciting. It doesn’t promise a revolution. I mean I’m still trying to understand the revolution part because here’s how I think about it—and Senator Sanders sort of alludes to this—in order to have the revolution, first we have to take back the Senate and get to 60 votes. Then we’ve got to take back the house and that may require some redistricting in order to get people out of safe Republican seats so they can be competitive again. I think we’re already in like year six or seven of a two-year term. So, you know those of us who understand this, who’ve been experienced, who have worked in it know that it’s a false promise. But I don’t think you tell idealistic people, particularly young people, that they’ve bought in to a false promise.
So, Hillary did mention people living in their parent’s basements but it’s also true that she was intending it to be sympathetic and not an outright insult like “basket of deplorables.” Getting beyond that one line, what she’s saying here is pretty interesting. She is basically making the case for incrementalism over the Sanders-style revolution. But she’s also doing it in a way that I suspect Sanders’ people will find fairly irritating.

Hillary Clinton is basically mocking the far left socialism that demands to know why we don’t have free everything right now. From this clip you can tell Hillary thinks these millennials have been sold a bill of goods. The revolution is a “false promise” because that’s not how things work in the real world. And she’s right. College grads living in their parent’s basement haven’t yet grasped the concept that someone always pays for their “free” stuff. And the people being asked to pay might have other things they’d like to do with their money.

The irony here is that since February when Clinton said this she has embraced Sanders’ free college plan (or something similar). As she said in this clip, you don’t want to tell young people they’ve bought into a false promise even if you believe that’s the case. Hillary needs those votes so she’s gotten into the business of making the same kind of free stuff pitch she criticized Sanders for in February. "
100228,1006,Alicia Machado is probably the best thing to happen to Hillary Clinton all year,http://hotair.com/archives/2016/10/01/alicia-machado-probably-best-thing-happen-hillary-clinton-year/,9,"I hadn’t previously bothered with the entire Miss Universe story because it’s obviously another piece of election season fluff which will fall out of the pockets of anyone with Donald Trump’s extensive and, shall we say… colorful storyline. I’d also assumed that with even marginally competent people managing the campaign message it would have disappeared in 48 hours. But for some reason I woke up this morning to see it being discussed on CNN and spread all over the pages of the Wall Street Journal yet again.

In a sharp escalation of his attacks on the 1996 Miss Universe winner, Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump kept alive a controversy over a beauty queen’s weight that could cause further damage to his standing among women voters…

His Democratic rival, Hillary Clinton, continued her embrace of Ms. Machado, a naturalized U.S. citizen from Venezuela who says she was humiliated by Mr. Trump, then the Miss Universe pageant owner, whom she said called her “Miss Piggy.”

Mrs. Clinton told Ms. Machado’s story in Monday’s debate, clearly surprising her GOP rival. Mr. Trump went on television Tuesday morning and began his attack on Ms. Machado, accusing her of gaining a “massive” amount of weight and nearly losing her crown.
I realize Allahpundit weighed in on it yesterday, but this is a different (and potentially larger) problem for The Donald than I’d originally thought. The entire Miss Universe thing is, as AP described it, an obvious PR scam arranged by Clinton to goose votes from women and Latinos. It shouldn’t have worked, but given the shrinking election calendar it’s turned into a surprisingly effective tool.

The problem here is that this is absolutely working for Hillary Clinton and she’s jumping on the bandwagon as hard as she can. (It also reinforces her “man who can be goaded by a tweet” theme.) And why wouldn’t she? The debate probably didn’t go as well for Trump as it might have, but up until that point Clinton was on the ropes. There was one bad story after another about her with many of them being serious enough that the MSM couldn’t avoid talking about them. Her numbers were tanking nationally and in multiple swing states. Trump fans had reason to be at least cautiously hopeful because it wasn’t as if she was going to unveil yet another policy initiative which was suddenly going to turn the electorate around.

And then this happens. Some dusty old story about about a beauty pageant contestant who is far from a role model but does happen to hit the media narrative bullseye of being both Hispanic and in possession of two X chromosomes. And because Donald Trump apparently can’t stand seeing a moment of the day when everyone isn’t talking out him he decides to hoist this flag up to the yardarms and go charging into battle in the middle of the night. The major problem here is that having the media talk about somebody else (specifically Hillary) was actually working for Trump. We were at a point where all he needed to do was keep looking at least marginally serious about some significant campaign issues, even if they seemed a bit dry and boring, and allow Clinton to collapse into a pile on her own.

Now the worm has turned for the umpteenth time in this election and the cable news networks have a new shiny object to play with. Clinton’s numerous flaws and ethics problems slink off to the back burner again and the remaining undecided voters are handed a new reason to question Trump’s seriousness and credibility. It’s time to get off this Miss Universe train let the news about Clinton’s many problems pull her under. Can Donald do it? I’m starting to have doubts."
100229,1006,Video: Gingrich and Hannity stage an intervention with Trump over Alicia Machado,http://hotair.com/archives/2016/10/01/video-gingrich-hannity-stage-intervention-trump-alicia-machado/,9,"It’s an intervention in absentia. Trump’s not there, but when you’ve got a VP shortlister on this show, of all shows, urging Trump to cease and desist immediately, you’d better believe it’s going to get back to him. It’d be like Pravda publishing an open letter to the Soviet premier begging him to change course on something. When a political mistake has reached the point where your own house organs are inveighing against it, it’s objectively a major mistake. Newt:

“You can’t tweet at 3:00 in the morning. Period. There’s no excuse. Ever. Not if you’re gonna be president of the United States. So he’s really gotta decide… If he’s gotta be himself, then he may well not win. If he’s willing to grow into the role of president, than he may win.”
This wasn’t even the worst moment for Trump on Fox News yesterday. A new Fox poll conducted entirely after the debate has the race Clinton 43, Trump 40, with Hillary up two points since mid-September. Head to head it’s Clinton by five over Trump, 49/44, which matters if you suspect that some of Gary Johnson’s and Jill Stein’s supporters will decide in the end to choose between the two major-party nominees. Two weeks ago Trump led the head-to-head race 46/45. The debate might not have hurt him much but it clearly helped her:

Clinton leads among women (+20 points), non-whites (+66), and voters under age 45 (+8). She gained with each of those groups since the debate. Compared to two weeks ago, her advantage among women increased by 7 points, by 15 points among non-whites, and 8 among voters under age 45 (the candidates were tied in mid-September)…

59 percent feel the real estate mogul lacks the temperament to serve effectively as president. By comparison, 67 percent say Clinton has the right temperament — a notable improvement from 59 percent before the debate.
Trump actually trails Clinton now on … honesty, with 35 percent saying she’s honest and trustworthy versus 31 percent who say so of him. The good news for Trump fans, though, is that the gap between them on whether people would feel “comfortable” with them as president isn’t that large. You would think it’d be yuuuuge given the large difference between them on whether each has the right temperament to serve, but nope: One good debate next Sunday from Trump could make that metric a dead heat. This result, on the other hand, is surprising to me. Americans hate the status quo in Washington, and yet… That could be amplifying Trump’s temperament problem. A political newbie who seemed to have a presidential temperament might be a safe bet for voters despite the fact that they’re skittish about candidates with no government experience. When you have no experience, though, and behave erratically? That bet’s not so safe.

One other note from the crosstabs. Two weeks ago, Fox saw a pretty red electorate turning out in November. Two weeks later, not so much: Hillary led by three points among registered voters in the previous poll, but when they switched to those who are likeliest to vote, Fox saw Trump ahead by one. In the new poll she actually gains when you move from registereds to likelies, though. Hillary leads by four among the former and by five among the latter. Did some anti-Hillary voters on the left like what the saw on Monday night enough to decide to turn out for her this year after all?

By the way, when Fox’s pollsters asked people who won the debate, Clinton came out on top by a 61/21 margin. That 40-point spread is, I believe, the largest gap of any scientific debate poll taken this week. Imagine Hannity’s face when he saw the data. Exit quotation from Ben Carson: “He won the majority of the online polls.” "

Who are we kidding?

We’ve all thought this was the case for a long time.

Same goes for men who voted for John Kerry in 2004 and Barack Obama in ’08 and ’12.

Basically any man that votes Democrat, period.

Liberal men are far more effeminate than conservative men. Let’s call it like it is. There’s a reason why Brown University installed tampon machines in men’s restrooms. Now, a Florida doctor is trying to capitalize on the situation…

From NBC 2: A Fort Myers doctor says if you are a man thinking about voting for Hillary Clinton, you may need to have your testosterone checked.

It’s a controversial commercial hitting Southwest Florida airwaves.


The doctor says it’s a humorous way to promote his business and also join the political discussion. But some radio listeners aren’t laughing.

“Most are not aware of the effect low T can have on your mental state. For instance your ability to focus and think clearly,” he said.

Dr. Dareld Morris of Morris Medical and Weight Loss Center in Fort Myers is issuing a warning to all men regarding their testosterone levels.

“As a community service, for any guys out there that are thinking of voting for Hillary, I want to offer you a free testosterone test. Let’s see if we can help,” Dr. Morris says in his ad.

Liberals won’t get a whiff of this because they don’t read the news, but if they did they’d have a field day.

Whether it’s just a way for this guy to promote his business or not, he makes a valid point about men who want Clinton to be president.

From Breitbart: During his campaign rally in Michigan on Friday, Donald Trump demanded that President Obama not pardon Hillary Clinton.

“So here’s my question for Hillary Clinton: can you promise that not one of the five people who were granted criminal immunity will ever be allowed to serve in a Clinton Administration?” Trump stated while speaking to thousands in Novi, Michigan. “And here is the demand I am making today to President Obama: will you pledge, here and now, not to issue a pardon to Hillary Clinton and her co-conspirators for their many crimes against our country and society itself?” I don’t know if Trump should be asking anyone to make a ‘pledge.’

After all, he waffled repeatedly on whether or not he’d support the Republican nominee.

That being said, this was merely a tactic to rile up the crowd.

I’m sure it worked.

It’s really not even close.

One glaring example?

The day after the debate, Hillary Clinton held a rally that saw 300 to 500 supporters in attendance.

Trump, on the other hand, had 15,000 show up to his event – and another 12,000 had to be turned away because the place was at capacity.

That’s not all. Since the conventions ended for both major parties roughly two months ago over 330,000 folks have attended Trump’s rallies, compared to just under 14,000 for Hillary.

YUGE! From Gateway Pundit:

It’s now been 2 full months since the conventions ended and Donald Trump is CRUSHING Hillary Clinton in event attendance during this period.


…

Since August 1st when both parties’ conventions concluded and through the end of September, Trump has had nearly 340,000 people at his events with thousands turned away due to space limitations. He has set records for some of these locations in attendance. However, Hillary has only had 14,000 total at her rallies since August 1st. To put this in perspective, Trump has had nearly a third of a million (324,000) more people at his rallies than Hillary and 24 times the crowds she has accumulated. Trump turned away 12,000 people Tuesday night alone which was roughly the same amount of people that Hillary had at all her rallies since August 1st through that date!

Trump has participation at his rallies nearly 10 times that of Hillary and Hillary is barely averaging getting in front of 200 people per day at her rallies over this 2 month period. This is kind of a big deal.

How Hillary is managing to remain tied nationally in the polls is really the most shocking part.

Democrats are not enthusiastic about grandma representing them, nor should they be. She has done (and will do) nothing for them."
100233,1008,Libs Wrong Again: Humans Are Naturally Violent,http://www.americanthinker.com/articles/2016/10/libs_wrong_again_humans_are_naturally_violent.html,9,"Are humans innately violent? Anthropologists have often said ""no"" -- in public. But troubling facts kept bubbling up, until in 1966 Napoleon Chagnon published a breakthrough field study of the violent Yanamamo tribes in Venezuela. 

Rousseau's Noble Savage, the primitive man-child who only killed in self-defense, started to crumble fast. In the real world, of course, the daily toll of human-to-human violence never stopped. In warlike tribes the adult male death rate from interpersonal violence now stands around one out of three. Because humans adapt in many different ways, that number is variable. 

A new study published in Nature, the world's original scientific journal, now compares human death by violence with other species and finds it to be remarkably stable, hopefully ending a century of desperate debate among anthropologists, who tried to uphold a taboo against reporting real human violence among primitive peoples. This lie -- that native humans are people and loving --  is still peddled by liberal professors who simply will not face the fact. (It should also be noted that the 1986 Seville Statement, which condemns theories that human aggression is innate, remains in effect today.)

What's wrong with lying about human nature? Well, the myth of human peacefulness has been used to support a century of Marxist tyranny, resulting in authoritatively estimated 100 million deaths. Marxist regimes, their heads filled with false assumptions, routinely conclude that if humans are naturally peaceful, and if the people and the peasants resist their tyrannical demands, then those dissenters must be evil and deserve death. One hundred million people have been murdered under that false assumption, as found by the best historical study done so far, at the Centre Nationale de Recherche Scientifique in Paris. Many historians working on the study consider themselves Marxists. 

The fact is that lies kill in human politics, and that lies about human nature kill more than the usual run of lies. Take Barack Obama, apologizing compulsively for America wherever he does, while doing nothing to reduce the black-on-black murder rate in inner-city Chicago. Obama will do anything to uphold his false belief that other countries are models of peaceful behavior, and that it is capitalism that causes people to kill each other in places like the United States. Obama's fixed obsession is simply false and misleading, and it serves to prop up his whole delusional belief system that supports Jihad (Holy War) against infidels as pursued by his friends the Saudis and his money supplier the Muslim Brotherhood. It is amazing how a single false premise supports a mounting structure of lies. (The purpose of those lies is to accuse white America, and to excuse black America. Just watch him run that scam over and over again.)

Human genes influence our actions, but they are not totally controlling. The history of civilizations is the history of controlling violence, going back to the first settlements more than 10 millennia ago. Every great pyramid-building empire from Babylonia to Beijing symbolized an overarching societal pyramid, in which the god-king is armed with magical weapons to overpower his priesthood, who would overpower the soldiery, who would overpower the slaving peasantry. Often the result was merciless tyranny, which means violence practiced to keep a violent people in line. Even Marxists today like to talk about how peaceful Cuba is, as if they don't really know how severely rebellion in punished in Cuba. Again, a deep lie about fundamental human nature is used to tyrannize over people. 

Modern civilized nations generally manage to find a compromise between out-group violence and in-group violence. Historically the English-speaking nations have been very lucky, because they had natural boundaries against aggression -- the Channel and Irish Sea protected Britain, and North America was protected by the great oceans, and by weaker nations to the north and south of the continental United States. We cannot claim to be especially virtuous and peaceful, but we have been very lucky in our 200 years of growth since 1776. That has made all the difference. 

Enter the Left, with its deeply delusional blaming system aiming to destroy one big class of evildoers after the next. The Left is all wrong about human beings being naturally peaceful and loving. In response, they always want to punish somebody: The capitalists, the bourgeoisie, the Ukrainian peasants, the White Folks in America, male heterosexuals, it never stops. If only the following mass of human beings was dead and wiped out forever we would have the peace and love that so naturally stems from human nature. The Nazis had the same insane conviction about the Jews and other inferior peoples, and Jihad holds that belief about the infidels. Human being are naturally drawn toward messianic cults that promise peace on earth forever and ever, if only the bad folks were good and dead. That is not an overstatement. It is the plain truth about utopian Marxism in the 20th century. 

_Just telling the truth about human nature, which is quite violent all by itself, may seem like a tiny step towards sanity. Yet historically, the worst mass-killing beliefs human have owned have also led to the worst killings. Anthropological findings about natural ""background"" levels of killings may help to bring people back to a more tragic view of human life. We can at time reduce the rate of killing. The means to that end are obvious: alertness, and honest police force, and restraining the mob when it wants to destroy the forces of civilization. It isn't hard. All it takes is common sense and a common front against violence. That may not create utopia, but it can minimize human violence. _

100234,1008,Will a Republican Ever Again Win the Presidency?,http://www.americanthinker.com/articles/2016/10/will_a_republican_ever_again_win_the_presidency.html,9,"The chances of a Republican victory in a presidential election are continually diminishing with each succeeding cycle, to the point that a Republican victory from this point forward will have to be regarded as an exceedingly unlikely occurrence.

There are three main reasons:

Demographics
We’ll look at this in the post-World War II era only, because that’s the time period most relevant to this discussion. According to official U.S. Census data, the percentage of the U.S. population defined as White has declined from 89.5% in 1950 to 72.4% in 2010. Black percentage (yes, the Census uses ‘Black,’ not ‘African American’) has gone from 10.0% in 1950 to 12.6% in 2010. But it’s the Hispanic category that has shown the most dramatic change, rising from 2.1% in 1950 to 16.3% in 2010, with the vast majority of that gain from 1990 onwards. Conventional wisdom says that Republicans get a large portion of their voting support from “traditional” White voters, while the Black and Hispanic blocs are cited to be substantial majority supporters of Democrats. It’s quite clear that both the raw percentages and the demographic trends are moving very strongly in the Democrats’ favor and will continue to do so, for reasons that are well understood.

Liberal media bias
The mainstream “traditional” media (TV, print, over-the-air radio, etc.) is overwhelmingly liberal and favors so-called Democratic causes such as Pro Choice, Affirmative Action, various Green/Alternative Energy initiatives, gender/sexual-orientation-based policies, relaxed immigration, a less prominent military posture, etc. The new media like Facebook, Twitter, Snapchat etc. are also liberally-slanted, since time and again, intentional or unthinkingly automatic-but-unintentional anti-conservative biases and actions have been revealed at these sources. The only overtly intentionally-conservative media outlets are some AM talk radio programming, certain Fox News cable TV opinion shows, like Hannity, and websites like Americanthinker.com, Brietbart.com, or Daily Caller.com.

The takeaway is this: Every single American is exposed to countless liberal impressions and programs each day, whether they want to be or agree with it or not. But... in order to hear or see intentionally conservative news and opinion, it must be explicitly sought out. For those people who don’t ever wish to be exposed to conservative thought, it’s easily avoided.

Let’s make some logical, defensible assumptions here: There is a certain percentage of the electorate that will always vote Democrat or Republican, regardless of the actual qualifications or characteristics of the candidate. For the sake of conversation, let’s assign the number of 40% to each side. That leaves 20% in the middle, as so-called “undecideds.” Included in this 20% are the large bloc of voters we can refer to as the “casually-attentive,” those voters who barely pay attention to the various issues, who make up their mind at the last minute based on looks or ‘feel,’ and then go right back to their non-attentive ways immediately following the election.

This group also gets the repeated automatic exposure and repetitive daily liberal impressions from the traditional mainstream media and the new media. They’re on Facebook every day, they hear the news on TV, they see the headlines of the NY Times in the lunchroom at work, etc. They don’t intentionally seek out conservative sources like Hannity or Rush, because these voters are, by definition, “casually attentive.” All their inputs are liberal, over and over and over.

Whether this middle segment is 40-20-40 or 45-10-45 or 35-30-35 makes no difference. That middle casually-attentive voting bloc—the bloc that decides virtually every election—receives only liberal media inputs.

Democrats’ mastery of the quick sound bite
Democrats are far better at playing the ‘quick, memorable, impactful sound bite’ game than Republicans. Those snappy phrases and dicta get picked up and repeated by the media continually, until they become part of the national political lexicon. The result is that many of the election-swinging casually-attentive voters subconsciously absorb these as being true, with predictably disastrous results for Republicans.

Here are just a few:

Bush lied, people died.
Tax cuts for the rich.
Republicans are waging a War on Women.
The rich need to pay their ‘fair share.’
Wall Street greed caused the housing collapse.
Republicans are anti-Hispanic.
Republicans are homophobic.
Global Warming is the fault of profit-hungry Republicans.
Republican-led Big Drug companies are ripping you off.
It may be a bit more difficult to pin down the reasons as to why Democrats are so much better at this, but they are. Republicans continually make the mistake of thinking that the merits of the argument will carry the day. It doesn’t. A long drawn-out, logical, sequential explanation may be effective in a court of law, but in a 7-second attention span world, it’s the quick memorable sound bite that wins the day. There are no Republican equivalents to the above Democratic talking points. Smartly, Democrats have an effective sound bite crafted for every single one of their voting support groups: women, environmentalists, African-Americans, Hispanics, gender-oriented and so on. Every group has several Democratic sound bites targeted right at them.

Until and unless Republicans can condense their best persuasive arguments down into 7-second snapshots (and those Republican points had better be factual, a requirement the Democrats can happily dance around, since their liberal media allies never call them on it), casually attentive voters will remain elusive and unconvinced.

Conclusion

All three of these major reason categories are moving in the wrong direction for Republicans. The demographics are becoming more Democratic-sympathetic with each succeeding election cycle. In an ever-expanding portable device world, new liberal media outlets are being created constantly, all by liberally-sympathetic curators, aimed at younger, liberally-oriented audiences. And finally, Republicans -- perhaps because of the very nature of their ‘logical, sequential’ mindset -- are falling farther and farther behind in their ability to adapt to the changing media/communications landscape.

If the Republicans don’t win in 2016, then (assuming a 2-term Democratic presidency), their next shot will be 2024 and by then, their hill will be significantly steeper. Maybe too steep.

100235,1008,The Problem Is Conservatives' Acceptance of Progressive Government,http://www.americanthinker.com/articles/2016/10/the_problem_is_conservatives_acceptance_of_progressive_government.html,9,"Many conservatives are frustrated with our society's lack of acceptance of conservatism into the mainstream. But it's not because of Republican Party weakness or a failure in political strategy, as some conservatives such as Steve Deace suggest on talk radio and among the Internet and TV pundit class.

The problem is because conservatives have abandoned the true moral principles underlying a civilized society: private property, free exchange, and individual liberty.

Starting about a century ago conservatives began to surrender their moral principles to the progressives' collectivist schemes, including the income tax, FDR's New Deal, LBJ's Great Society and the idea of ""civil rights."" Even before the 20th century a child's education was usurped from parents, and conservatives have accepted government schooling, or government-authorized private schooling, ever since.

Many people have been conditioned, however, to rationalize those kinds of compulsory government schemes.

In the conservatives' caving to progressive ideology for a century, they have obediently accepted the income tax, which is a form of institutionalized theft.

Compulsory taxation is theft because it is involuntary. The government uses threats against the people to coerce them to forfeit a certain amount of their income to bureaucrats.

In contrast, the private producers and businesses of society must depend on the voluntary payments to them by consumers for goods and services. If it is immoral of businessmen to demand payments involuntarily (in which case the businessmen would be called ""gangsters,"" or ""thugs""), then it is immoral for anyone to do that.

No one should be above the law when it comes to the basic rule of society against theft. For a moral society to flourish the people need to be civilized. And a truly civilized society would not allow its government (or the people themselves) to commit theft and plunder, or to even have an apparatus in place to enable the bureaucrats to forcibly seize the people's wealth and property.

Involuntary governmental taxation of the people's wealth and property and mandatory reporting of private information are what enable and empower the Lois Lerners and her IRS comrades to persecute conservative and Tea Party groups, for example.

If we didn't have the income tax, then FDR and LBJ's intrusive and destructive New Deal and Great Society programs probably could not have been passed and funded. (Could the activists possibly get enough people to fund those programs voluntarily?)

Conservatives have naively accepted those schemes, including Social Security, the government's own compulsory retirement and medical coverage racket.

Privacy is another issue that relates to the immorality of compulsory taxation and government social schemes. The government demands private, personal information from you, where you work, how much you earn, what investments you have, or how many people the businesses employ and how much the employers pay the workers, information that is none of government bureaucrats' business.

If your private information is none of your neighbors' business, then it is none of the government's business, in my view.

It is sad that conservatives are getting behind a known left-liberal progressive for president such as Donald Trump, who has donated thousands upon thousands of dollars to big government Democrats, and who promises progressive central planning health care schemes and all the rest.

All the increased spending Trump wants to impose is the opposite of what the country needs to restore our freedom. Unfortunately, Trump does not seem to understand that the government is not a business. It's government, a forced monopoly on the people. And regardless of his purported tax-cut plan, the money with which he wants to spend in the trillions is other people's money, taken from them involuntarily. Like most politicians, Trump seems to show contempt for free markets, private property, and privacy.

Private property and private property rights are very important aspects of a civilized society. But conservatives do not seem to realize how their abandonment of private property has greatly contributed to the cultural decline that many of them have been complaining about.

Conservatives have also joined the progressive activists in further damaging the moral principle of private property rights in their acceptance of ""civil rights"" legislation.

Of course, it is politically incorrect to point this out, but the 1964 Civil Rights Act (and subsequent ""civil rights"" legislation) should only have addressed the right of all people access to public property and government-run functions such as the public schools, city parks, and buses, and so on. 

When addressing ""public accommodations"" in civil rights legislation, the inclusion of privately-owned establishments such as hotels and restaurants was the progressives' way of further usurping control from private property owners. It also empowered members of certain protected classes to forcibly enter private property against the will of the property's owners.

And is it a big surprise that the list of the government's protected classes continues to expand?

Many conservatives are rightfully worried about society's cultural decline.

But would we have to deal with gender-confused individuals threatening to invade the other sex's bathroom if it weren't for the aggressive empowerment of certain protected classes, in the name of ""civil rights""?

Would we have lesbian couples getting away with suing Christian bakers who refused to bake a cake for a same-sex wedding? In the modern era, ""civil rights"" necessitates the infringement of private property rights.

And would we have college cupcakes running amok and censoring conservative speakers and expelling ""microaggressors"" were it not for government-run universities and government-financed private universities which rely on taxes taken involuntarily from America's workers and producers?

And would there be so much promiscuity among today's youths without the tax-funded governmental promotions of ""sexual liberation"" and abortion-on-demand?

The real solutions for those examples of cultural decay include abolishing the immoral institutionalized plunder of taxation and the entire system of redistributionism which makes such societal degeneration possible, and restoring private property rights as the American founders had intended.

But do the conservative talk radio crowd and pundits ever consider these solutions? Alas, apparently not.

Conservatives spend a lot of time promoting their social agenda. But, unfortunately, conservatives seem to erroneously believe that using the progressives' taxation and bureaucracy apparatus to promote their social agenda is actually morally legitimate and practical. They do not seem to understand the necessity of private property and private property rights for such social traditions to flourish.

Further, instead of conservatives advocating the dismantling of governmental intrusions and usurpations which violate private property rights, most of the discussion and activism on the part of conservatives has been a matter of defensive political strategy.

Oh, we have to donate to this or that candidate to keep the Senate a Republican majority. (So the Republicans can continue expanding the welfare state, of course.)

Or we have to vote for this or that presidential candidate because he might appoint better Supreme Court Justices, we hope, cross our fingers. (See John Roberts, Anthony Kennedy, and David Souter on the value of this form of defensive election strategy.)

In the end, defensive election strategizing doesn't work, it seems to me.

Instead of continuing to accept the progressives' immoral governmental apparatus of theft, plunder, trespass, and invasiveness, the conservatives might consider dismantling it altogether.

100236,1009,COMEY: THE WATERGATE VARIATIONS,http://www.powerlineblog.com/archives/2016/10/comey-the-watergate-variations.php,9,"In his NRO column on FBI Director James Comey’s testimony to the House Judiciary Committee on Wednesday, Andrew McCarthy acknowledges his “real affection for the director” before he deconstructs his testimony. Andy notes: “When Mills lied to agents about not knowing of the Clinton homebrew server while at State — a story that doesn’t pass the laugh test — this false account was shrugged off as one of those innocent, unresolvable failures of recollection.”



 
 
Comey was shrugging it off in response to a question posed by Rep. Jason Chaffetz in the last minute of his questioning in the video above. Andy’s affection for Comey from their days working together in the office of the United States Attorney for the Southern District of New York may survive the failure of Comey’s testimony to pass the laugh test, but I think Andy prefers to criticize Comey from the high ground.

Kim Strassel, by contrast, goes at Comey on the same point in her Wall Street Journal column “Jim Comey’s blind eye.” Kim calls Comey’s failure of the laugh test “the second revealing moment in the middle of Comey’s testimony to the committee” (read the whole thing for the first). Kim writes:

The FBI has deliberately chosen to accept this lie [that Mills didn’t know about Clinton’s homebrew email server]. The notes of its interview with Ms. Mills credulously states: “Mills did not learn Clinton was using a private email server until after Clinton’s tenure” at State. It added: “Mills stated she was not even sure she knew what a server was at the time.”

Which brings us to the hearing’s second revealing moment. Rep. Jason Chaffetz (R., Utah) pointed out that the FBI’s notes from its interview with Clinton IT staffer Bryan Pagliano expose this lie. In late 2009 or early 2010, Mr. Pagliano told investigators, he approached Ms. Mills to relay State Department concerns that the private server might pose a “federal records retention issue.” According to Mr. Pagliano, Ms. Mills told him not to worry about it, because other secretaries of state had used similar setups.

More damning, Mr. Chaffetz held up an email that Ms. Mills sent in 2010 to Justin Cooper, whom the Clintons personally employed to help maintain the server. The email reads: “hrc email coming back—is server okay?” Mr. Cooper responds: “Ur funny. We are on the same server.”

To be clear: When Mrs. Clinton had an email problem, Ms. Mills didn’t call the State Department’s help desk. She didn’t call Yahoo customer service. She called a privately employed Clinton aide and asked specifically about Mrs. Clinton’s “server.” She did this as chief of staff at the State Department. Mr. Chaffetz asked Mr. Comey why the FBI wrote that Ms. Mills was ignorant about the server until later.

Here Kim quotes Comey performing what students of ancient history will recognize as the Watergate variations:

Mr. Comey suddenly sounded like a man with something to hide. “I don’t remember exactly, sitting here,” he said, in what can only be called the FBI version of “I don’t recall.” He then mumbled that “Having done many investigations myself, there’s always conflicting recollections of facts, some of which are central, some of which are peripheral. I don’t remember, sitting here, about that one.”

Really? Only a few minutes before he had explained that the Justice Department was forced to issue immunity to Ms. Mills because she had asserted attorney-client privilege. Yet he couldn’t remember all the glaring evidence proving she had no such privilege? Usually, the FBI takes a dim view of witnesses who lie.

Anyone paying attention understands exactly what is going on here. The Watergate variations add a mordant touch."
100237,1009,HILLARY BEHIND CLOSED DOORS,http://www.powerlineblog.com/archives/2016/10/hillary-behind-closed-doors.php,9,"The Washington Free Beacon has posted a 50-minute audio of Hillary Clinton speaking to donors at a fundraiser behind closed doors this past February. The Free Beacon has posted the audio with a report by Lachlan Markay here. When she gets behind closed doors, she doesn’t let her hair hang down. However, she does show another side of her face.

Josh Feldman slices an excerpt featuring Clinton’s take on Sanders supporters for Mediaite here. The pseudonymous Tyler Durden of ZeroHedge pans the whole thing for gold here.



ZeroHedge quotes this excerpt (audio above):

It is important to recognize what’s going on in this election. Everybody who’s ever been in an election that I’m aware of is quite bewildered because there is a strain of, on the one hand, the kind of populist, nationalist, xenophobic, discriminatory kind of approach that we hear too much of from the Republican candidates. And on the other side, there’s just a deep desire to believe that we can have free college, free healthcare, that what we’ve done hasn’t gone far enough, and that we just need to, you know, go as far as, you know, Scandinavia, whatever that means, and half the people don’t know what that means, but it’s something that they deeply feel. So as a friend of mine said the other day, I am occupying from the center-left to the center-right. And I don’t have much company there. Because it is difficult when you’re running to be president, and you understand how hard the job is — I don’t want to overpromise. I don’t want to tell people things that I know we cannot do.

ZeroHedge comments:

The hacked audio provides another peek into the ideological chameleon that Hillary is on a day to day basis. As the Intercept notes, “Clinton has been inconsistent in the past about espousing political labels. She has at times touted herself as stalwart liberal.”…

In one segment of the leaked audio, Hillary focused on her opponent at the time, Bernie Sanders, was pointed to successful programs in Scandinavia which provide universal daycare, family leave, and government sponsored healthcare and college education, as policies that he would seek to adopt. “Progressive” Hillary mocked the compared idea of “free college, free healthcare” to the “extreme” ideas promulgated by the right, which include “populism, nationalism and xenophobia.”

ZeroHedge has more here. In an alternative universe where such things were treated equally among candidates accorded to their relevance and interest, this would be huge, unending news."
100238,1009,HILLARY BEHIND CLOSED DOORS (2) [UPDATED],http://www.powerlineblog.com/archives/2016/10/hillary-behind-closed-doors-2.php,9,"In the audio clip below from Hillary Clinton speaking this past February behind closed doors at a Virginia fundraiser, Clinton discusses Bernie Sanders and his appeal to his young supporters.

She mocks Sanders’s promised “revolution” (“I’m still trying to understand the revolution part”). She understands that the “revolution” is predicated on “a false promise,” but she won’t break it to them. To borrow a phrase, it wouldn’t be prudent.



UPDATE by JOHN: The Associated Press spins the leaked audio for Hillary:

In a leaked recording from a February fundraiser, Hillary Clinton expressed empathy for young voters who sided with her then-primary opponent, Bernie Sanders.

Actually, she expressed contempt. But those who rely on the AP for their news won’t learn that."
100239,1010,Key figure behind ‘Brexit’ will coach Trump before the next debate,https://thinkprogress.org/farage-coaches-trump-180eba273865#.jewbjgle9,9,"One of the most influential figures behind the United Kingdom’s recent vote to leave the European Union, widely referred to as ‘Brexit,’ is set to coach Donald Trump before the next presidential debate.
Nigel Farage led the United Kingdom Independence Party (UKIP), an anti-Europe and far right wing party, until he stepped down less than two weeks after the Brexit vote. Farage was widely criticized after backtracking on his claims that £350 million ($454,247,500) paid to the European Union would be used on the national health services after Brexit. Though UKIP denies the reports that Farage has flown to the United States to help Donald Trump prepare, other UKIP sources confirmed to the Guardian that he plans to help Trump in some way before the election.
“Politics aside, Farage is considered a skilled orator and debater. In the days leading up to the June EU referendum vote, the then prime minister, David Cameron, refused to debate with him, agreeing only to appear on the same program,” the Guardian reported. “And following a one-on-one televised clash with former deputy prime minister Nick Clegg on the issue of Europe, polls suggested viewers were swayed by Farage.”
Trump seemed to struggle in the first presidential debate against Hillary Clinton. He often rambled and lost his composure. He later claimed the debate was rigged and that there were issues with his microphone.
“Regarding the first debate, there were issues regarding Donald Trump’s audio that affected the sound level in the debate hall,” the Commission on Presidential Debates said in a statement.
Trump said he “spent 50% of my thought process” dealing with the sound issue. His opponent, Clinton, responded, telling reporters, “Anybody who complains about the microphone is not having a good night.”
Much like Trump, Farage is a right wing populist with anti-immigrant and anti-Muslim views, though he did say Trump’s call for a total Muslim ban was a “political mistake too far.” Something else he shares with Trump is his propensity for making shocking statements. As the Guardian reported on Saturday, “in debates, speeches and radio station appearances, the former Ukip leader has called for immigrants with HIV to be banned from Britain, said he would be concerned if his neighbours were Romanian, suggested breastfeeding mothers should ‘sit in a corner,’ and said women were paid less because they were simply ‘worth far less.’”
The two leaders seem to share a good rapport, as Farage stood side by side with Trump at a rally in Mississippi in August. Farage called Trump “the new Ronald Reagan” at the time_—_a statement with which many Republicans would surely disagree. “It is worth remembering that virtually everyone thought that Ronald Reagan was unfit to be the U.S. president before he made a huge success of his two terms,” Farage wrote in an essay after the rally in Mississippi.
UPDATE:
A spokesperson for Farage said he was currently in the U.K. "
100240,1010,Trump tells his supporters to watch polling places in urban areas,https://thinkprogress.org/trump-tells-his-supporters-to-watch-polling-places-in-majority-black-cities-63c985af5a0d#.ve9tp1spb,9,"At a rally near Detroit on Friday, Donald Trump urged his supporters to monitor polling places to make sure everything is on the “up and up.”
“You’ve been reading the same stories as I’ve been reading, so go to your place and vote. And then go pick some other place and go sit there with your friends and make sure it’s on the up and up,” the GOP nominee said. “Because you know what, that’s a big, big problem in this country and nobody wants to talk about it. So go and watch these polling places.” He then made a nod toward election rigging, suggesting “that would be one hell of a way to lose.”
Friday night’s comments echo similar statements Trump made at a rally in Altoona, Pennsylvania this summer encouraging his supporters to take election monitoring into their own hands.
At that event, Trump told the crowd to “go down to certain areas” and “make sure other people don’t come in and vote five times.” Another speaker at the Altoona event, GOP Rep. Bill Shuster, specifically called out one of the state’s largest urban areas, saying that “the people in western and central Pennsylvania have to overcome what goes on down in Philadelphia.”
Both Detroit and Philadelphia, of course, are areas with large populations of black voters where Trump is unlikely to have much support to begin with. The GOP nominee is polling at zero percent in Detroit and among black voters in Pennsylvania, according to Detroit News and NBC News polls. Although voter fraud is virtually non-existent in the United States, Trump has made the specter of fraudulent ballots a central element of his campaign. He frequently suggests the electoral process can’t be trusted and says the system is “rigged” for Hillary Clinton. And he has specifically called for volunteer “election observers” to help him “stop Crooked Hillary.”
This rhetoric is resonating among Republican voters. A poll released this weekend found that nearly half of Trump’s supporters don’t trust that votes will be counted accurately this election.
Election observers play an important role in the democratic process. But Trump’s rhetoric raises questions about how far his supporters might be inspired to go to harass people at the polls_—_particularly if those supporters are already too skeptical about the integrity of the vote counting process.
In a piece published in Politico Magazine this past week, an academic who’s overseen state election observation efforts expressed concerns that Trump supporters might go too far to discourage people from casting ballots. Jocelyn Benson, the dean of Wayne State University of Law School, writes that Trump’s particular brand of “poll watching” might actually translate to making it more difficult for people of color to vote.
It’s useful to ask what Trump’s intent is in deploying poll-watchers. Judging from his public statements and dire predictions of a “rigged” election, Trump does not seem concerned about protecting voters from discrimination or ensuring that all eligible voters are able to cast their ballots. Instead, he’s concerned that he will lose. Informed by the candidate’s “rigged” rhetoric and suggestions that there is widespread voter fraud, Trump’s observers seem primed to mainly challenge voters’ eligibility.
Trump seems to be advocating for a type of election monitoring that relies on volunteers to use deceptive practices that are often used to prevent people of color from voting. […] Trump’s worry is not that legitimate voters will be prevented from casting a ballot; his concern is that they will vote.
Making matters worse, this will be the first presidential election in 50 years without a functioning Voting Rights Act, after a 2013 Supreme Court decision gutted key pieces of the landmark civil rights legislation.
That means the Department of Justice_—_which used to deploy trained election observers to oversee districts with a history of suppressing minority voters’ rights_—_won’t have the same power to keep an eye on the polls in every state where people of color have historically been disenfranchised. "
100241,1010,One year of Trump’s tax returns were just revealed. Now we know why he won’t release the rest.,https://thinkprogress.org/one-year-of-trumps-tax-returns-were-just-revealed-now-we-know-why-he-won-t-release-the-rest-a68e88a6038a#.wl4dg3gx3,9,"Someone sent an envelope to the New York Times with the key pages of one year of Trump’s tax returns, 1995. The pages revealed that, that year, Trump claimed over $900 million in losses.
That means Trump could have made over $50 million a year for nearly two decades and paid nothing in federal taxes. (The I.R.S. lets taxpayers apply loses for up to 18 years to offset future and past income.)
The losses stem from “a dizzying array of deduction, business expenses, real estate depreciation, losses from the sale of business assets and event operating lawsuits” that flow from various entities control by Trump to his “personal tax returns.”
The blockbuster disclosure is likely to be a focus of the presidential race’s final five weeks. There are a few things to keep in mind as the story plays out.
The was no audit pending on these returns (and many other years)
Trump’s 1995 tax returns are not under audit and, by his own admission, neither are any tax returns filed prior to 2009. This is a letter released earlier this year by the Trump campaign.

Trump could release them all, now, and show exactly how much he paid in taxes from 1995 through 2008.
There is no evidence from the IRS that Trump is, in fact, under audit for any year. But Trump’s accountant wrote the letter above claiming he is under audit from his 2009 return forward.
An audit, however, does not prevent someone from releasing tax returns.
Trump views paying no taxes as a sign of intelligence
The key moment in the first presidential debate was Trump claiming that his ability to avoid paying any taxes makes him “smart.” Trump continued this approach in responding to the New York Times story. He did not deny that Trump’s 1995 return enabled him to avoid paying taxes for many years. Rather, a statement from the Trump campaign described Trump as “a highly skilled businessman” with a duty to “pay no more tax than legally required.”
“Mr. Trump knows the tax code far better than anyone who has ever run for President,” the statement concluded.
Of course, if he really believed not paying taxes made him look good, he could have released these returns himself.
 Trump appears to be taking the opposite approach. His lawyer threatened to sue the New York Times if they printed the story.
Trump has also publicly criticized others for not paying taxes. Trump may have a mole
The New York Times reported that they received these documents in an envelope mailed from New York City with a return address of Trump Tower.
Someone can, of course, write whatever they wish as a return address. But tax documents are sensitive material and would be extraordinarily difficult to obtain without inside access.
UPDATE (10:22PM): The Trump campaign released a statement on the disclosure of his 1995 tax returns. "
100242,1002,Exclusive — Tens of Thousands Projected to See Trump in Colorado as He Takes Lead in State over Hillary,http://www.breitbart.com/big-government/2016/10/02/exclusive-tens-thousands-projected-see-donald-trump-colorado/,10,"DENVER, Colorado — Tens of thousands of people are expected to come out to see Donald J. Trump, the Republican nominee for president, over the course of two events just added to his campaign schedule on Monday in the all-important battleground state of Colorado. 
Compared with Hillary Clinton, his rival and the Democratic nominee for president who has all but abandoned the state as Trump takes the lead in polling, that’s a significant amount. Clinton had trouble filling a small venue the last time she was in Colorado in early August.

“The last time Hillary Clinton was in Colorado was in early August,” Trump’s Colorado state director Patrick Davis told Breitbart News on Sunday night. “She had trouble filling a high school auditorium in Commerce City. We expect thousands of people in Pueblo and tens of thousands in Loveland tomorrow.”

Colorado’s nine electoral votes make it one of the most critical battleground states, and the last time a Republican won the state in the presidential election was George W. Bush in both 2000 and 2004. Barack Obama, the outgoing current Democratic president, won in both 2008 and 2012, defeating John McCain and Mitt Romney in those respective contests.

Trump will appear at 3 p.m. Mountain Time in Pueblo, about two hours south of Denver, and then at 6 p.m. Mountain Time in Loveland, about an hour north of Denver. While most in the legacy establishment media refuse to cover the people who come out to Trump rallies, Breitbart News will be on the ground to provide live coverage with photographs and videos with the crowd.

“If you go to a Trump rally, you see it,” Davis told Breitbart News about the clear enthusiasm gap that exists between Trump’s energetic campaign rallies and Clinton’s boring speech events. “You feel it. It’s more rock concert than it is political rally.”

Trump, according to the RealClearPolitics polling average, has taken a slight lead in Colorado over Clinton of a half a percent with momentum at his back. The latest Breitbart News Network/Gravis Marketing survey from Colorado has Trump up four points over Clinton, just outside the survey’s margin of error. Davis said it’s a combination of developments that have led to Clinton’s drop off in support in Colorado, and Trump’s surge: She’s not in the state, her campaign and the Democrats aren’t airing television ads, and staff for Clinton and the Democrats are rushing out of Colorado as fast as they can. Mix that together with Trump’s appeal on economic issues, immigration, the Iran deal, and healthcare policy, and you’ve got a winning campaign in Colorado.

“I think it’s two things: One is the strength of his message about the economy and jobs — Colorado’s economy is actually humming along pretty well,” Davis said:

I think his message to the voters of Colorado is “you like what you got now? Just wait until I become president. It will be rocking.” The other thing that’s helping is he’s been here quite a bit. He’s spending money here. We’re on television here. We have a very good sized field staff and ground game going on here. You go to even a small Trump rally in a local field office, 200 or 300 people will show up — these are people you don’t know. But there’s a lot of energy in Colorado. On the other side of the fence, Hillary’s campaign is all but dead here. She’s not on television. You don’t see phone banks filled. Actually, you see some staff leaving the state on the Democratic side. It does feel like they’ve abandoned Colorado.

When told of how the campaign of GOP senatorial nominee Darryl Glenn informed Breitbart News of the fact that the Iran deal, Obamacare, and immigration are frustrations voters here have with the status quo in Washington, D.C., Davis said: “They’re right on.”

Glenn, a fellow outsider like Trump who’s also seeing a surge in polling in the state as he runs against incumbent Democrat Sen. Michael Bennet (D-CO), told Breitbart News in his own exclusive interview that he thinks this is an outsider’s year.

“The bottom line is whether it’s the establishment or whatever, people are really tired of politicians saying one thing to get elected and then selling out to special interest groups and really not representing people,” Glenn said in the interview, the full version of which is forthcoming.

With regard to Obamacare specifically, Davis said, Coloradans are seeing their premiums go up and their plans go away.

“On Obamacare, the problem in Colorado is that people are seeing their policies go away — be taken away — they’re losing their coverage. And their premiums are skyrocketing in Colorado,” Davis said. “So, people are being forced into Obamacare and they don’t have any choices. So the quality of care, the quality of insurance, is going down.”

Davis added that the Department of Veterans Affairs, “and how we treat our veterans,” is certainly “resonating here.”

“We have a couple big high profile VA clinics here, one being in Aurora in Congressman Coffman’s district that is a complete unmitigated disaster,” Davis said:

The VA has completely screwed that up—it’s way over budget and it’s still not finished. That is the poster child of the dysfunction at the VA, and it’s right here in Colorado. If you’re a veteran in Colorado and looking for healthcare, in some cases you wait for months. We don’t have enough good doctors in the VA system to put our veterans in front of. Mr. Trump was here at the beginning of September and he proposed rolling out a program in Colorado Springs — or in Colorado in general — where we would give veterans a card and say “go find a doctor that will see you and can help you and we will pay for it,” not keeping them tied into the VA system. Mr. Trump said he wanted to roll out that plan here in Colorado first, and that was widely well and positively received.

Trump’s surge in the polls in Colorado is coinciding with some of the most vicious attacks that the Hillary Clinton campaign — and their allies in the legacy and establishment media in Washington, D.C., and in New York City — have levied against the businessman. Given the nature of Colorado voters — free-thinking and independent-minded with a disdain for elitists telling them how to think — that doesn’t surprise Davis one bit.

“The people of Colorado, all across the board — all types of voters, Republicans, Democrats, independents, libertarians, socialists, even Green Party — they are not cheap,” Davis said:

We like to think for ourselves. We have a healthy suspicion of the mainstream media in Colorado and I think that’s why you see people like Donald Trump doing very well here, because he treats individuals — voters of all types — like individuals. He doesn’t treat people like “African Americans” and “Hispanic Americans” — he treats them like Americans. And he wants them to prosper individually and that message comes through loud and clear. I think people are open to listening to what Mr. Trump has to say here, not what is being said in the mainstream media.

Davis also predicted that Trump will intensify his efforts to reach out to Hispanic voters in the coming days.

“We’re going to hear a lot in the next couple of days about Mr. Trump’s appeal to Hispanic Americans, and Hispanics in Colorado,” Davis said:

In my experience, in the past couple of months — particularly after Trump’s speech in Phoenix about immigration — the Hispanics in Colorado were telling me and were telling the campaign that he had given them some hope that the doorway wasn’t closed for them to have a say in the immigration policy in a Trump administration. They took his speech as the beginning of conversation, not the closing of a door, and I think you’re going to hear more of that in the coming days."
100243,1002,New York Times: Trump Losses May Mean He Didn’t Pay Taxes for Years,http://www.breitbart.com/big-journalism/2016/10/02/new-york-times-trump-losses-may-mean-didnt-pay-taxes-years/,10,"WASHINGTON (AP) — Donald Trump’s business losses in 1995 were so large that they could have allowed him to avoid paying federal income taxes for as many as 18 years, according to records obtained by The New York Times.
In a story published online late Saturday, the Times said it anonymously received the first pages of Trump’s 1995 state income tax filings in New York, New Jersey and Connecticut. The filings show a net loss of $915,729,293 in federal taxable income for the year.

That Trump was losing money during the early to mid-1990s — a period marked by bankruptcies and poor business decisions — was already well established. But the records obtained by the Times show losses of such a magnitude that they potentially allowed Trump to avoid paying taxes for years, possibly until the end of the last decade.

Trump’s campaign released a statement on Saturday lashing out at the Times for publishing the records and accused the newspaper of working to benefit the Republican nominee’s presidential rival, Democrat Hillary Clinton.

“The New York Times, like establishment media in general, is an extension of the Clinton campaign, the Democratic Party and their global special interests,” the campaign said, calling Trump “a highly skilled businessman who has a fiduciary responsibility to his business, his family and his employees to pay no more tax than legally required.”

The statement added that Trump had paid “hundreds of millions” of dollars in other kinds of taxes over the years.

Since 1976, every major party presidential nominee has released tax returns. Clinton has publicly released nearly 40 years’ worth, and Trump’s running mate, Indiana Gov. Mike Pence, has released 10 years of his tax returns.

But after initially saying that he would make his returns public during the course of his campaign, Trump switched course, citing what he said were years of ongoing IRS audits and the advice of his attorneys to keep them private as those audits proceed.

Former IRS officials have expressed skepticism that anyone would be audited so frequently, and they and other tax experts say there’s no prohibition on Trump releasing his returns even if he is.

In its story, the Times said the three pages of documents were mailed last month to a Times reporter who had written about Trump’s finances. A postmark indicated they had been sent from New York City and the return address claimed the envelope had been sent from Trump Tower, the newspaper said.

Trump’s campaign did not directly address the authenticity of the excerpts from Trump’s tax filings. Former Trump accountant Jack Mitnick, whose name appears as Trump’s tax preparer of the filings, confirmed their authenticity, the newspaper reported.

“This is legit,” Mitnick told the newspaper.

The Times said a lawyer for Trump argued that publication of the records would be illegal because Trump had not authorized their disclosure.

Because of provisions in the tax code that allow wealthy individuals to offset their personal income with losses in various partnerships and business ventures, Trump could have used his losses in 1995 to avoid incurring tax liabilities on as many as three years of prior and 15 years of future profits.

The $916 million in losses reported by the Times would not include previous years of losses incurred by Trump while his New Jersey casino empire slid into bankruptcy.

In an interview, Mitnick told the Times he had sometimes found it odd that the tax code allowed Trump to live in such luxury without paying income taxes.

“Here the guy was building incredible net worth and not paying tax on it,” he said."
100244,1002,George W. Bush Daughter Seen at $5K Per Ticket Clinton Fundraiser,http://www.breitbart.com/big-government/2016/10/02/george-w-bush-daughter-seen-5k-per-ticket-clinton-fundraiser/,10,"It appears that there is another member of the Bush clan supporting Hillary Clinton for president after reports surfaced that George W’s daughter, Barbara, attended a Saturday night fundraiser for Hillary. The $5,000 per ticket event allowed partygoers the opportunity to hobnob with Clinton’s top aide, Huma Abedin.
Barbara Bush spent the night of October 1 rubbing elbows with Abedin in Paris, France, at a special Clinton fundraiser held during the City of Light’s famed Paris Fashion Week. According to The Daily Mail, Bush “paid at least $5,000 for the privilege.”

The party featured Abedin, Hollywood actress Dakota Fanning, and other celebrities. Black Eyed Peas band member Will.i.am also participated in events during the weekend geared at “mobiliz[ing] the expat vote with just five weeks to go.” Left to right: Huma Abedin, Derek Blasberg, Barbara Bush, actress Dakota Fanning, and hostess Lauren Santo Domingo (Instagram / @thelsd)

The special party was co-hosted by Vogue magazine’s editor-in-chief Anna Wintour and concluded with a dinner at American socialite Lauren Santo Domingo’s Paris home with tickets costing $5,000 per seat ($10,000 to “co-host” with “preferred seating”).

Huma Abedin, Hillary’s long-time top aide, has been in the news quite a bit lately. She was embarrassed yet again by the sexual abuse allegations against her husband, Anthony Weiner. The one-time Congressman is now under investigation for soliciting sex from a 15-year-old girl. He was also condemned for allegedly using his infant son as a “chick magnet” to get women.

But more worrisome is Abedin’s troubling involvement with Hillary’s email scandal. During an FBI investigation, for instance, Abedin told agents she had no knowledge of Hillary’s illegal email server yet released documents suggests she lied to the FBI.

Despite all these scandals, young Barbara Bush was seen mingling with Abedin and, according to The Daily Mail, shelling out big dollars for Hillary’s campaign to do so. Barbara is hardly the first Bush said to be refusing to support the duly nominated candidate for the Republican Party, Donald Trump, and supporting Clinton instead. Many were aghast when her grandfather, former President George H.W. Bush, was reported as telling a member of the Kennedy clan that he was voting for Hillary.

The former President is only one of the Bush clan seemingly acting the turncoat to his own party. H.W.’s son, former Florida Governor and failed GOP presidential candidate, Jeb Bush, has also been on record as refusing to support his own party.

Even after Donald Trump essentially won the GOP nomination for president, for instance, Jeb petulantly insisted that he would never vote for Trump. And at the end of September, Jeb reiterated his refusal to support the party by insisting that Republicans should stay home in November because, in his estimation, not voting would make a “powerful political statement.”

Jeb’s super rich, establishment donors have followed their preferred candidate’s lead, too. One Bush donor pledged to donate a whopping $2 million to Hillary’s Latino outreach program to help her get elected in November.

Still another Bush has also been reticent to support the party’s nominee. Texas Land Commissioner and Texas GOP Victory Chair George P. Bush, Jeb’s son, initially said he would never vote for Donald Trump. But only a few months later it appears he softened his stance by saying it is important to stop Hillary so Republicans should “swallow a bitter pill” and vote Trump.

But not everyone in the Bush family orbit have turned against the Republican Party. Recently no less than 50 Bush appointees came out with a bold and forceful endorsement of Donald Trump. "
100245,1003,"Trump’s Genius: “Very, Very Good Story”",http://www.huffingtonpost.com/mark-silva/trumps-genius-very-very-g_b_12303140.html?utm_hp_ref=politics,10,"Donald Trump will prove to be the “genius” his supporters say he is if the worst story of his presidential campaign_—_about a legacy of legal avoidance of income taxes_—_becomes one of his greatest assets.

Or the worst week of Trump’s campaign could prove to be the undoing of his candidacy_—_a week that started with a widely panned debate performance against Hillary Clinton and concluded with a story about potentially evading 18 years of income taxes, punctuated with pre-dawn Trump tweeting about an overweight beauty queen and then, at a rally, an unsupported allegation that Clinton is unfaithful to the husband who cheated on her.

The suspicion of tax avoidance got its first largest audience with Clinton’s allegation in their premiere debate viewed by 84 million_—_Trump suggesting it “makes me smart”_—_and found confirmation in The New York Times’ weekend report of tax returns showing that Trump reported $916 million of business losses in 1995, enough to earn him credit for 18 years of carried-forward losses potentially preventing him from paying any taxes.

Only to be enshrined in the lockbox of political parody, a Saturday Night Live Opening: Actor Alec Baldwin’s Trump, interrupting Kate McKinnon’s Clinton with repeated utterances of “wrong... wrong,” offered this on the suggestion of tax evasion: “Warmer.”

Eleven swing-state opinion polls have proved more promising for Clinton since the first of the debates. Clinton’s incredibly bad post-Labor Day episode of pneumonia and commentary on Trump’s “deplorable” supporters was quickly overtaken by one debate triumph. Americans rated Clinton winner of the debate by “a near-record margin” in ABC News/Washington Post post-debate polling, with “nearly half saying Trump got his facts wrong and one in three saying he outright lied.” Fifty-four percent of those surveyed said Clinton “mainly got her facts right in Monday’s debate” while just 29 percent said Trump “mainly stuck to the facts.”

“Why won’t he release his tax returns?” Clinton asked in that debate_—_facing the first major party nominee since Richard Nixon who has refused to reveal his returns. “Maybe he is not as rich as he says he is,” she said. “Maybe he is not as charitable as he claims to be... Maybe he doesn’t want the American people to know that he has paid nothing in federal taxes.” Pressing the idea that “there is something he is hiding,” she pointed to known evidence from old filings with casino gambling regulators that he had paid no taxes in some years. “That makes me smart,” Trump replied.

But it was the response of the Trump campaign to the Times report based on tax returns mailed to the paper anonymously and confirmed by the accountant who’d filed them that laid the story bare. No denials, only defenses: Neither Trump nor his campaign rebutted the contention that reporting $916 million of losses in 1995 could prevent him from paying any taxes for 18 years. Instead they spoke of how many local and state property taxes and “federal taxes” he’s paid_—_payroll taxes, for instance.

Trump was an “absolute genius” for reporting the loss on his personal tax returns, Rudy Giuliani, the former New York mayor and former U.S. attorney for the Southern District of New York, said of the candidate who may have dodged the Internal Revenue Service for close to a generation. “This is a perfectly legal application of the tax code, and he would’ve been a fool not to take advantage of it,” Giuliani said on ABC News’ “This Week.”

Proving that he, too, had gotten the morning memo, New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie_—_another former federal prosecutor, said of the Times report on the Republican nominee’s tax avoidance: “This is actually a very, very good story for Donald Trump.”

“What it shows is what an absolute mess the federal tax code is and that’s why Donald Trump is the best person to fix it,’’ Christie said on Fox News. “There is no one who has shown more genius in their way to maneuver around the tax code...The early 1990s was a difficult time for lots of folks. ... Donald Trump wrote the book the Art of the Comeback ... He fought and clawed back to build another fortune.”

In the days between the first debate and its focus on questions of Trump’s taxes and the report about how he’d avoided them, Trump spent considerable time confronting the other arrow Clinton hurled at him on the debate stage: His comments about the Miss Universe who’d gained too much weight. Clinton had gotten under Trump’s thin skin with her talk of Alicia Machado, a.k.a. in Trump’s parlance as “Miss Piggy.”

“Did Crooked Hillary help disgusting (check out sex tape and past) Alicia M become a U.S. citizen so she could use her in the debate?” Trump tweeted in a pre-dawn Twitter tirade.

That sex tape had no more support in reality than what Trump had to say personally about Clinton on stage Saturday night at a campaign rally in Pennsylvania_—_as news of his tax dodging was breaking in New York. “Hillary Clinton’s only loyalty is to her financial contributors and to herself. I don’t even think she’s loyal to Bill, if you want to know the truth,” Trump told his audience in Manheim, Pennsylvania. “”And really, folks, why should she be, why should she be?”

This, from a candidate whose first marriage dissolved during an affair with his second wife-to-be. “I don’t talk about that,” Trump told the Times in an interview before the tax story broke. “I wasn’t president of the United States.” (Giuliani, asked about his own experience, said: “Everbody does.”)

Pure Genius, the way Giuliani and Christie see the Trump tax line. The worst week of Trump’s campaign for president, the way polling is portraying it.

“National polls conducted since Monday’s presidential debate have shown Hillary Clinton ahead of Donald Trump by an average of about 4 percentage points_—_a meaningful improvement from her position before the debate, when she led by just 1 or 2 points,” FiveThirtyEight’s Nate Silver writes. “Now, it’s becoming clearer that battleground state polls are moving toward Clinton as well.”

It’s difficult to see how the revelation of Trump’s taxes and the Trump campaign’s justification of them will prove to be “a very, very good story.”

Though maybe a better story than Alicia Machado’s."
100246,1003,"Clinton/Trump: One Likes Facts, The Other Figures",http://www.huffingtonpost.com/mark-green/clintontrump-one-likes-fa_b_12302698.html?utm_hp_ref=politics,10,"By Mark Green

The first debate not a knockdown but a wipeout, Bob Shrum & Ron Christie agree. On tax returns, birther-ism. interruptions & Machado, says Shrum, “Hillary killed him and Trump committed suicide.” Can Trump now prepare better and stop obsessing about the weight of a beauty queen? Fat chance. 

Economics in Debate. According to Bob Shrum, who’s coached numerous Democratic nominees for presidential debates, “that was the worst presidential debate performance in my lifetime. She baited him at the beginning and end [on a $14 million loan from father and on Miss Universe winner] and he took it each time.” Although Trump did well enough during the 20 minutes on trade, “overall she won the economic exchange because he offered a disjointed defense of how tax cuts create jobs and had no feel for a narrative that moves voters.”

#NeverTrump Ron Christie scoffs at Donald’s mockery of Hillary’s stamina since “he couldn’t stand there for 90 minutes without running out of intellectual and physical steam.” We concur that he scored by accurately saying that she did once call Trans Pacific Partnership “the gold standard” but she scored by calling his tax cuts for the rich “trumped-up trickle down” and noting that she had “prepared for this debate...and to be president.”

Speaking of preparation, both Bob and Ron are amazed both that he wasn’t prepared with a good answer on his tax returns and that he self-sabotaged by interrupting that he’d be “smart” if he avoided paying all taxes [which the NYTimes confirmed six days later]. His linking of releasing his tax returns if she released undisclosed emails, says the Host, is too clever by half “since it makes clear that the audit needn’t stop him from releasing them.”

Birther and Beauty Queen. The panel agrees that when moderator Lester Holt asked why he had continued prosecuting his claim even after Obama’s birth certificate was released, Trump gave a long-meandering response about publicly unknown people in the Clinton camp who allegedly started it, though that had been debunked by all fact-checkers. Worse, concludes Ron, is when he twice said “I have nothing to say” to black viewers about asking the first black president for his papers.

True, Clinton planted a political IED with her insertion of beauty contestant Alicia Machado’s story into the conversation...but, with his eyes open, Trump stepped on it by implying that he hardly knew who she was and, adds Bob, later “turned a one day story into a five day one with his insane 3am tweets”.

Unlike Romney and Kerry who Ron and Bob respectively briefed for their debates, Trump didn’t want to hear how he could improve his answers. “He’s undisciplined, he’s losing,” concludes Shrum, “and doesn’t want anyone around him telling him when he’s said something stupid, As JFK once told Teddy, a president should reward that kind of staff behavior, not punish it.”

For example, in an lesson from Debate 101, the Host emphasizes that when you are asked a question about a real vulnerability, as Clinton was about her “super predator” remark and her emails, “she knew to brush it aside and not wrestle with a tar baby.” Not Trump, notes Bob. “His problem is that he’s a classic bully who knows how to run over people but becomes a cry-baby when someone hits him back.”

What should each do in the next debate on October 9th, in a town hall setting? Shrum argues that there’s not much Clinton should do differently. “Trump’s failures shouldn’t distract from how good Clinton was in the first debate — loose, knowledgeable, even humorous.”

Will Trump be even “tougher” on her, as he warns, implying that he’d discuss her husband’s affairs as he almost did this last time? Ron thinks that’d be insane since reminding everyone that Hillary was the victim boosted her prospects in the late ‘90s after the Monica Lewinsky scandal. The Host agrees: “It would like when Cleavon Little, the black sheriff in Blazing Saddles, put a gun to his head and told menacing townspeople, “drop your guns orthe Nigra gets it!” My guess: since he and surrogates have already inserted the issue into the political conversation, he need not and won’t do that, especially in a town hall debate with citizen questioners. Perhaps this is hopelessly naive but even this strutting loudmouth doesn’t want this to be the biggest memory of his presidential candidacy.

After the debate and post-debate, Clinton was chided for telling a labor audience, “why am I not ahead by 50 points?” In my interpretation, she was implying a gender-based double standard. That right?

Well let’s imagine where she’d be in the race if she had 5 children in 3 marriage and was an admitted serial adulterer, washed money through a charity, violated the Cuban embargo and hugged Putin, coaxed support from the “alt-left”, was rated the campaign’s biggest liar by fact-checkers, implied her opponent should be shot, didn’t know what the nuclear triad was, and interrupted her rival 50 times? Probably not the front-runner. Yet it’s Trump who complains about Holt, a mic, a rigged system while Clinton, to the best of my memory, hasn’t publicly complained about anything in the campaign so far.

Remember all the fuss in 2008 about a (non-existent) video of Michelle Obama taunting white people, as if that alone would end her husband’s candidacy? Trump’s done 25 things like that...and we have five weeks to go."
100247,1003,Trump Wants To Be ‘America’s Putin’: Here Is How He’ll Do It,http://www.huffingtonpost.com/paul-abrams/trump-wants-to-be-america_b_12299750.html?utm_hp_ref=politics,10,"Donald Trump does not just admire Vladimir Putin. He wants to be Vladimir Putin, American-style.

Putin’s presidency provides him a monopoly of power and also control of the Russian economy. He has used that power to make himself, and a small group of insiders, very wealthy, to suppress criticism, and to exact revenge on opponents.

That is what Donald Trump has tried to do all his life. At his campaign rallies, he already cheers on his goons. With the presidency, and all that power, he can make himself very rich, and broach no criticism. What more could any narcissist want?

If one can stand the stench for a moment, put yourself into Trump’s shoes. Born into the lap of luxury and taught that your sh*t does not stink (a.k.a., the making of a narcissist), he has no capacity for guilt, shame or remorse. And, he has admitted it without any qualms: when asked how he felt when bad things happen, he said “nothing matters”.

He brandishes his wealth to push others around with lawsuits they cannot afford, and harassment. (A.k.a., a petty tyrant, and thug.) He deliberately surrounds himself with “unsuccessful” people so he will have their fawning respect. (E.g., the “latino outreach” chief of his campaign has filed for bankruptcy 14 times!)

Trump has no actual talent, and the attention span of a three-year old on any subject — other than himself, that is... His uncle is an MIT professor, his sister is a judge and he is... what? Basically, a flim-flam man.

Narcissists generally “know” at their core that there is nothing really there, but they must reject that thought in less than a nanosecond, lest their entire psychological façade collapses. Ivanka Trump revealed a deep insight when, complaining about Kellyanne Conway’s assertion that the campaign staff had “scolded” Trump for his debate performance, said, “no one scolds my father”.

Really?

Meanwhile, it must grate on Trump’s ego to have had to watch truly talented people make much greater fortunes by actually creating something of value, and without millions from daddy (one can gauge how much daddy’s help kills Trump because he tries so hard to diminish or deny it): Apple’s Steve Jobs (part Syrian background, how infuriating!), Michael Bloomberg (a Jew, also infuriating), Bill Gates (world’s wealthiest man, a nerd), Carlos Slim (a Mexican!!), George Rathmann (a scientist!),while many of his own businesses have failed (as Penn Gillette said, “Trump could not sell steak to an obese nation”), and he has had to defraud people (Trump University) or stiff them (vendors and employees) out of millions of dollars. [By my rough calculation, Trump has made at least $40M by not paying vendors or employees what their contracts called for].

But, taking control of a government has made huge fortunes for other sociopaths. Vladimir Putin, his buddy Viktor Yanukovych (Ukraine) for whom a Trump campaign manager also worked, among other things, to undermine NATO, Gulf State rulers, the Sheikh of Brunei, Ferdinand Marcos, Saddam Hussein, and so forth. Name a despot, and one will always find a large fortune.

Power. Power for its own sake, power to exact revenge, and power to amass a level of wealth to which that he has always aspired. Most truly wealthy people either prefer not having it known, certainly not discussed, and usually give low-ball figures. Or, as Texas oil billionaire Lamar Hunt once said, “if you know how much you are worth, you are not very wealthy”.

Not Donald Trump. This is the be-all and end-all of his existence. And, others must know about it, otherwise it does not satisfy his insatiable ego needs.

And, that is what Trump aspires to do. If, today, he has to win women’s votes by concocting some gerry-rigged scheme he can call “child care,” and allege that no one ever addressed it before he did, then he will do it. He could not care a hair on his diminishing pate about children, women, or care.

If he has to tell blue collar workers that he will bring back their jobs, he will tell them that — but, what he will not do is bring back his own jobs because he can make larger profits by keeping them where they are. And, no one has ever explained how money trickles down from the enormous tax cuts to depressed regions — it doesn’t.

He told coal workers he would bring back their jobs — despite natural gas undermining the coal market regardless of government regulations. He knows he can do nothing about it, but tells them anyhow.

So, here is what a Trump presidency will look like. Trump will be granted favorable tax breaks and other concessions in the US, and around the world in exchange for US foreign policy changes such as removing sanctions from Vladimir’s friends, , and his “blind trust children” will use them to grow his fortune. He will administer the law however he chooses, and the Republican House will never impeach him. He will, e.g., tell businesses they can flaunt EPA rules, not abide by OSHA standards, and so forth.

How will he do this? Do we not have “checks-and-balances”? Not to Donald Trump who, as Mr. Khan said at the convention, has likely never read the Constitution, and certainly cares nothing for it.

First, all right wing despots move to control the judicial system. Why? Because unlike kings, who ruled under the “divine right theory”, the despots have no legitimacy. Hence, they have to create it.

The fire-drill to take absolute control is frighteningly simple: Trump will fire all the US Attorneys and replace them with people whose only mission is to protect and extend Trump influence. He will demand, in advance, a signed letter of resignation that he can date whenever he finds them not doing what he wants.

The same will be true of judges, and even Supreme Court Justices. He will appoint some bozo to the Supreme Court whose only judicial philosophy is to help and protect Donald Trump.

And, there you have it. The complete takeover of the judicial system. With his other actions now protected by the imprimatur of “law”, Trump will proceed to take over the economy and use monopoly of power for his own ends.

Most leaders who care about performing their jobs well look for people who are better than they are. Not Donald Trump. He wants inferior people who, therefore, will respect him. Translation: he will find people who will do what he says because they are thankful to have the power and prestige.

Through the National Security Agency, that monitors everyone’s messages, calls, emails, and so forth, Trump will gain total control over society — exactly the danger Eric Snowden sacrificed to expose. The head of NSA — are you thinking Rudy Guiliani? The man responsible for police and firefighters’ deaths by ignoring expert advice after the World Trade Center bombing in 1993, and placed communications hub back at the WTC, so that firefighters and police responding to 9/11 had no radio communications.

If Trump asks him to mine for information he can use against anyone or any company or any official, do you really think Rudy will deny him? After all, Rudy himself compared Putin favorably to Obama because Putin made “quick decisions”, whereas Obama had to think about it, and also discuss it with others.

And, of course, do not forget the IRS. The Commissioner will be a Trump crony. Trump’s back tax returns will be mysteriously “lost” on the IRS computers. And, while Lois Lerner was merely doing her job, determining whether special tax preferences for “social welfare” groups applied to organizations with names that included “Party”, Trump’s IRS will resemble nothing like we have ever seen. Critics will be audited, and prosecuted by Trump’s US attorneys.

Again, any agency head that does not provide Trump with what he wants will be fired. Trump will have those undated, signed, letters of resignation in his back pocket, so it will all seem legal.

What about the media? Will they not be exposing all of these gross transgressions daily, and riling up the public? Of course not. The media will, at best, present “both sides of the debate” as if they had legal and moral equivalence, but, after a time, even that will become more than Trump is willing to stomach. As he has already in his campaign, he will simply deny access to himself and any member of the Administration. Without access, the medias’ ratings will wither. And, thus, so will its financial viability. Rupert Murdoch, however, will do great.

And, then, of course, will come the renewals of FCC licenses. If you are a critic of Trump, or even air too many of his critics, do not bet on a license renewal.

Not all of this will happen at once. It will be a gradual, but deliberate destruction of the democracy and justice, of a balanced market system, all to serve the needs of our own “dear Leader” to whom, one of his sychophants, Amarosa, has already said, we will all bow down.

Donald Trump has never involved himself in any cause greater than himself, or even that did not help himself. His hotels and golf courses and condos are not affordable by ordinary Americans. He believes workers are overpaid, he stiffs workers and vendors, he lies about providing child care to employees, he will not even sacrifice some profits to bring his own businesses to the US and provide jobs for Americans... what makes anyone believe that he has the remotest interest in achieving anything for them unless it enhances the power and fortunes of Donald Trump?

People do not realize how close we came before to a destruction of our democracy. Had one man, crusty old Judge John Sirica, not been offended by recognizing the Watergate burglars were lying to him, and had two enterprising reporters for the Washington Post not dedicated themselves to ferreting out the truth, had a disgruntled FBA official not helped them, it is possible that Nixon’s attempt to rig the election, suppress criticism, and take revenge against his enemies may have succeeded. They had fire-bombed the Brookings Institute, and burglarized Daniel Ellsberg’s psychiatrist, and spread false rumors about John Kerry when he was merely a Vietnam veteran who spoke eloquently against the war.

And, Nixon had a much deeper understanding, and at least grudging respect for, democratic institutions. Donald Trump has none of this, and makes no pretense about it.

Trump’s narcissism gives him an insatiable need for power and praise. His sociopathy enables him to do anything, absolutely anything, to obtain it.

Vladimir Putin is Trump’s role model. Trump will strive to be a greater Putin, because he will control a country that is, already, bigger and greater.

No one will stop him."
100248,1005,Watch Donald Trump Lecture Americans For Not Paying Taxes,http://www.motherjones.com/politics/2016/10/donald-trump-taxes-50-percent-Americans-dont-pay,10,"This weekend the New York Times detonated a bombshell by reporting that Donald Trump, using a loophole that benefits wealthy dynastic families, declared nearly a billion dollar loss on his 1995 tax returns—a loss that possibly allowed him to avoid paying any federal taxes for 18 years. (The full impact of this loss is not publicly known because Trump has stubbornly refused to follow the traditional practice for presidential candidates releasing his tax returns.) The Times account included a damning quote from Trump's former accountant: ""Here the guy was building incredible net worth and not paying tax on it."" After the story broke, the Trump campaign released a statement blasting the newspaper, calling Hillary Clinton more crooked than Richard Nixon, and claiming Trump ""has paid hundreds of millions of dollars in property taxes, sales and excise taxes, real estate taxes, city taxes, state taxes, employee taxes and federal taxes, along with very substantial charitable contributions.""

Without his tax returns, there is no way to determine if the campaign's assertion about Trump's taxes and charitable contributions is true. But in the past, Trump has frequently decried other Americans for not paying taxes.

On July 18, 2011, Trump appeared on Fox News and was asked about President Barack Obama's comments that well-to-do Americans should make a sacrifice for the country by paying more in taxes. He replied:

Well, I don’t mind sacrificing for the country to be honest with you. But you know, you do have a problem because half of the people don't pay any tax. And when he's talking about that he's talking about people that aren't also working, that are not contributing to this society. And it's a problem. But we have 50 percent. It just hit the 50 percent mark. Fifty percent of the people are paying no tax. This was a Republican talking point—and a misleading one. It was true that close to 50 percent of Americans did not pay federal income tax, but that was because they did not earn enough money to be hit by this tax. Many of these people were working for low wages, or were seniors or young people not earning wages, and they paid other taxes, including Social Security and property taxes. Yet here was Trump brandishing a favorite club of the GOP—makers vs. takers—to denigrate half of the nation.

In February 2012, Trump turned to Twitter to grouse about this. Later that year, Mother Jones reported that Mitt Romney had privately derided 47 percent of Americans as shiftless individuals who could not be bothered to take responsibility for their own lives. Trump hit Fox News to advise Romney not to apologize for the remark. And he again complained that half of Americans do not pay taxes and expect hand-outs from the government:

He should never apologize. Actually bring on this discussion....It's a discussion that maybe should be had. You do have a large percentage of people not paying taxes. You do have a large percentage of people that feel they're entitled.

In these comments, Trump was slamming people who didn't pay income taxes for feeling entitled and for essentially screwing those Americans who do.

More recently, Trump reiterated his criticism that 50 percent of Americans are free-riders, not contributing to society (presumably by not working and not paying taxes) and expecting to be taken care of by others. In a June 2015 interview with Fox News host Sean Hannity, Trump exclaimed,

The problem we have right now—we have a society that sits back and says we don't have to do anything. Eventually, the 50 percent cannot carry—and it's unfair to them—but cannot carry the other 50 percent.


Trump is now on the griddle for possibly exploiting a tax loophole that allowed him to amass wealth without paying federal taxes. His accountant told the New York Times that he harbored misgivings about this. Yet Trump boasted at the first presidential debate that if he did pay no taxes that was a ""smart"" move.

Perhaps it was a brilliant financial move. But how odious would it be if Trump was castigating low-income, working Americans for not paying federal income taxes while enjoying a billionaire's lifestyle and stiffing Uncle Sam. There is, of course, only one way for Trump to clear up this matter: release his tax returns. They might indeed show how he was a genius at avoiding taxation—but also a hypocrite. "
100249,1006,The NY Times’ transparent (and hypocritical) October surprise of Trump’s tax returns,http://hotair.com/archives/2016/10/02/ny-times-october-surprise-trumps-tax-returns-transparent/,10,"There’s only one news story popping up for the Sunday morning circus and it’s the long anticipated October surprise from the New York Times. Late Saturday evening they released a partial set of state tax documents belonging to Donald Trump which show a nearly one billion dollar business loss he took more than twenty years ago. As Business Insider explains, this factoid allows them to speculate that The Donald may have paid no federal taxes for nearly twenty years.

Donald Trump may have avoided paying federal income taxes for 18 years, according to tax records obtained by The New York Times and published on Saturday night.

The documents indicated that Trump declared a $916 million loss in 1995, providing him with a deduction so large it could have eliminated his obligation to legally pay annual federal taxes by up to $50 million for nearly two decades, tax experts told The Times.
The fire under all of this smoke is, of course, barely enough to light a cigar, but that’s not the point of the story. You’ll notice a constant set of phrases in all of the coverage of this “bombshell” release. They include things such as, might have and could have or may not have paid. That’s because the actual document only shows a massive loss which Trump claimed in 1995. What’s been established is that the loss in question opened the door to Trump potentially not owing any federal taxes over a considerable period of time because of the $916M loss. What’s also mentioned in decidedly muted tones is that if Trump wound up not owing any federal tax, that it was completely legal.

Let’s assume for a moment that Trump took full advantage of the tax laws in the way being described. (And frankly I’d start questioning his sanity if he didn’t.) This means that the Times has “caught” him following the tax code to pay the smallest amount of tax possible under the law. I mean, it’s not like anyone else does that, right? If Trump were A Good Person he would have massively overpaid his taxes and then we could all celebrate what a wonderful fellow he is, just like the people who handle the tax returns of the New York Times. Oh, wait… in 2014 the Gray Lady paid zero taxes and received millions in refunds despite having declared a substantial profit. (Forbes)

More recently, for tax year 2014, The New York Times paid no taxes and got an income tax refund of $3.5 million even though they had a pre-tax profit of $29.9 million in 2014. In other words, their post-tax profit was higher than their pre-tax profit. The explanation in their 2014 annual report is, “The effective tax rate for 2014 was favorably affected by approximately $21.1 million for the reversal of reserves for uncertain tax positions due to the lapse of applicable statutes of limitations.” If you don’t think it took fancy accountants and tax lawyers to make that happen, read the statement again.
But enough about hypocrisy. This was never about taxes to begin with and was always about the politics going on behind the scenes. The response to all of this from the Trump campaign was predictable and, if we’re to be honest, accurate.

“The only news here is that the more than 20-year-old alleged tax document was illegally obtained, a further demonstration that the New York Times, like establishment media in general, is an extension of the Clinton Campaign, the Democratic Party and their global special interests,” a campaign statement said.
I wonder where those tax documents came from? The person who the Times describes as an anonymous source might want to take a look at 26 U.S. Code § 6103 – Confidentiality and disclosure of returns and return information. The law has been broken here, but there’s scant mention of that in the Gray Lady. Imagine our surprise.

Since the New York Times and their allies are engaging in the speculation game here (“could have paid no taxes” etc.) let’s do a bit of that ourselves. What are the odds that the original person or persons who illegally obtained Trump’s tax documents and gifted them to the Gray Lady were only able to get their hands on a few pages of partial tax documents from a single year? Pretty much zero. There’s probably quite a bit more and the Times almost certainly is sitting on them, just as they likely sat on these documents until what they deemed was the most opportune time to provide the maximum help to Hillary Clinton. With that in mind, why not release them in a drip, drip, drip fashion? Every time another story breaks about Hillary Clinton’s emails, her repeated lies on the subject and the preferential treatment she received from the FBI, the New York Times can drop another tax document in an attempt to swamp the news cycle.

Of course we don’t know that, just as the Times (thus far) doesn’t know that Trump paid no taxes. But if I were trying to game the election that’s certainly how I’d do it."
100250,1006,Kathleen Willey: ‘Hillary Clinton’s been calling me a bimbo for 19 years’,http://hotair.com/archives/2016/10/02/kathleen-willey-hillary-clintons-calling-bimbo-19-years/,10,"Former White House volunteer Kathleen Willey gave an interview to the Examiner which was published Sunday. In the interview Willey says the sexual harassment accusations by women like herself also involve Hillary because she has been defending Bill:

“This no longer about Bill Clinton’s transgressions or his infidelities or girlfriends or sex … it’s not about that anymore,” Willey told theWashington Examiner. “What it’s about is the actions that his wife has taken against the women that he has raped and assaulted.”…

Willey said she has bristled at Hillary Clinton’s attempts to convince voters of her commitment to protecting women.

“Hillary Clinton’s been calling me a bimbo for 19 years, as well as Paula [Jones] and Juanita [Broaddrick] and Gennifer,” Willey said.
Willey claims she was groped during a meeting with the President in 1993. She had arranged the meeting because she needed money and wanted to ask the president for a paid position at the White House rather than working as a volunteer. During the meeting she claimed Clinton kissed her on the mouth, grabbed her breast and told her, “I’ve wanted to do this ever since I laid eyes on you.” Clinton claimed that he might have kissed Willey on the forehead but denied all of the other accusations. From a Washington Post story published in 1998:

On March 15, Willey made her allegation public with a splash. During an interview on “60 Minutes” she described in detail the crude sexual advance allegedly made by the president and said that when he denied groping her under oath, he committed perjury.

Clinton continues to insist that he told the truth in his deposition, in which he denied having any form of sexual relations with Willey. After Willey’s TV interview, the White House made public copies of several letters showing that Willey sought Clinton’s attention even after their purported encounter.
Willey would later file a lawsuit against the Clintons for the release of those letters without her permission.

After the alleged encounter in the White House and the suicide of her husband (which coincidentally happened on the same day) Willey later had a sexual relationship with a younger man which she lied about when questioned by the FBI. Willey later admitted to the affair when confronted with evidence. The FBI did not charge her for making the false statement but her credibility was damaged.

In 2007 Willey published a book, Target, about her experiences including the accusation that her home was broken into and a pre-publication copy of the book stolen. Here’s an interview she did with Neil Cavuto in 2007:"
100251,1006,Sunday morning talking heads,http://hotair.com/archives/2016/10/02/sunday-morning-talking-heads-31/,10,"An interesting choice of surrogates by Team Trump this morning. It won’t be Donald himself or Mike Pence out there, nor his go-to spokesmen over the last few months of Kellyanne Conway, Reince Priebus, or Newt Gingrich. It’s Rudy Giuliani, who made news a few days ago when he called Hillary “stupid” for introducing the subject of sexism into the debates. Quote:

    “I sure would’ve talked about what she did to Monica Lewinsky, what that woman standing there did to Monica Lewinsky, trying to paint her as an insane young woman when in fact Monica Lewinsky was an intern,” Giuliani said. “The president of the United States, her husband, disgraced this country with what he did in the Oval Office and she didn’t just stand by him, she attacked Monica Lewinsky. And after being married to Bill Clinton for 20 years, if you didn’t know the moment Monica Lewinsky said that Bill Clinton violated her that she was telling the truth, then you’re too stupid to be president.”

Rudy’s going to attack the FBI this morning too for letting Clinton and her cronies off the hook in Emailgate, no doubt, but he might have been tapped by Team Trump because he seems to be the ally who’s most comfortable raising the Clinton sex scandals of the 1990s. If Trump’s planning to go all-in on that subject at next Sunday’s debate, which it seems like he is, then Giuliani might be out there to prime the pump. He’s going to get the story rolling now to pique media interest this week and then Trump will take the baton at the debate. Or at least, that’s how a professional campaign would do it; who knows what Team Trump actually has planned. Giuliani will be on “This Week,” “Meet the Press,” and “State of the Union.”

Hillary’s main surrogate this morning is Bernie Sanders, who’ll spend less time attacking Trump, I’d guess, than begging his millennial fans to hold their noses and vote for her in November. Are there any millennials who actually watch these geriatric news shows? I suppose the YouTube clips that the segments will generate are worth something to Clinton. Sanders will be on “This Week” and “State of the Union.” The full line-up is at the AP."

This was not a good week for Donald Trump.

Most polls show Hillary Clinton clearly won the first presidential debate, and revelations about the billionaire not paying federal taxes for nearly two decades aren’t helping his cause.

Two hands?

Both hands and one foot?

Makes you wonder if all these women are lying, or if this the whole thing is just a “vast right-wing conspiracy?”


He was the most powerful man in the world at one time, so it would make sense that women would try to take advantage.

But given Slick Will’s history of lying, you have to believe his accusers.


Here’s Kathleen Willey saying Hillary was complicit in Bill’s sexual misconduct, just like so many other women have said…

From Washington Examiner: One of several women who have accused former President Bill Clinton of sexual misconduct is speaking out, saying Hillary Clinton shouldn’t be exempt from criticism over her handling of the affairs that nearly ended her husband’s presidency in the 1990s.

Kathleen Willey — a former volunteer White House aide who accused Bill Clinton of making aggressive, unwanted advances during a private meeting in 1993 — said she holds Hillary Clinton responsible for smearing her and the many other women who have come forward with stories about their treatment at the hands of her husband. "" This no longer about Bill Clinton’s transgressions or his infidelities or girlfriends or sex … it’s not about that anymore,” Willey told the Washington Examiner. “What it’s about is the actions that his wife has taken against the women that he has raped and assaulted.”

None of the allegations of sexual misconduct levied against Bill Clinton during his decades in the public eye have ever been proven definitively. The former president has denied the accusations, admitting only to consensual relations with Monica Lewinsky and Gennifer Flowers.

As Donald Trump clumsily navigated a controversy this week over 19-year-old comments he made to a former Miss Universe winner, a debate raged about whether similarly dated scandals with ties to his opponent — each of which involved the alleged mistreatment of women — were fair game on the campaign trail.

Republican strategists agreed that attacking Hillary Clinton for the exploits of her husband could easily backfire, and Democrats preemptively dismissed the tactic as unfair and potentially sexist.

But a few of Trump’s allies have begun to lay the groundwork for an assault that focuses on Hillary Clinton’s role in silencing her husband’s self-professed lovers and alleged victims. They say Hillary Clinton’s involvement in efforts to discredit and disparage women who accused Bill Clinton of sexual harassment, assault and even rape make the scandals relevant to the presidential race.

Willey said she has bristled at Hillary Clinton’s attempts to convince voters of her commitment to protecting women.

“Hillary Clinton’s been calling me a bimbo for 19 years, as well as Paula [Jones] and Juanita [Broaddrick] and Gennifer,” Willey said.

“She, you know, doesn’t have any room to talk,” Willey added

If you’re a friend of the Clintons, you can get away with murder.

If you cross them, watch out.

100255,1008,"In a Neighborhood of Gangs: The Warrant for Trump

",http://www.americanthinker.com/articles/2016/10/in_a_neighborhood_of_gangs_the_warrant_for_trump.html,10,"When you live in a neighborhood of gangs, you must accommodate the gang that does you the least harm. And you do, you know. You’ve always lived in a neighborhood of gangs. You always will. The only question is which gang you accommodate.

If you live on the right side of Los Angeles, Chicago, or New York, you’ve dodged the unlawful gangsters. But no matter where you live, you can’t dodge the lawful gangsters we call government.

All gangs have this in common: they’re alliances of bullies whose tactics deprive others of what the gangsters want. There’s no form of intimidation or expropriation to which gangsters won’t descend to get what they want. And what they want is dominion. Their tactics depend on the scope of dominion they seek and the paradigm under which they seek it. Some are petty and brutal. Some are grand and devious. None is more grand and devious than government. And when government goes awry, none is more damaging and more deadly.

The lust for power’s part of the human condition. The desire for dominion’s universal. And the historical record’s a litany of potentates and their ploys. Whether priests, princes, or presidents, the end game’s always the same. Only the players and the paradigms change.

In post-modern democracies, these are the players: a political class, a privileged class, an unprivileged class, and an underclass. And here’s the paradigm: the political class buys the votes of the underclass; the privileged class buys the patronage of the political class; and the unprivileged class gets ground beneath the politically-correct juggernaut.

In what’s left of the American Republic, the only meaningful political class is the Federal one. It has usurped the states’ constitutional powers. It has reduced political representation to a binary choice between candidates chosen by two private political parties conspiring to exclude all competition. It’s composed of careerist professional politicians interested solely in maintaining their power. It’s unprincipled and omnipotent. Its pretext is a social justice long since segued into a politics of victimization that divides to conquer. Its appetite is to make us all servants of itself.

There are only two political gangs in America. One’s the Democratic Party, and the other’s the Republican Party. The only difference between them is the side of political town on which you live. There is no opposition political party. In reality, the nation is governed by a professional political duopoly which merely caucuses in two private parties with different names. If one party didn't have the other, it would have to invent it merely to maintain the illusion of a political opposition and a two-party state. Their aims are the same: reducing the citizenry to neofeudal servitude on the Federal estate.

Until -- just possibly until -- Donald Trump, that is.

Trump can’t do a fraction of what he’s promising to do. Presidential candidates are essentially but the leaders of the two private political gangs that monopolize the nation’s governance. Constitutionally, the Federal legislature is the republic’s only real governing power. And, if Trump’s elected, he won’t have a Federal Legislature eager to help him achieve his promises.

But the real point is this. Trump -- a political interloper -- has already effected a stunning populist coup against the entire Republican Party establishment. That establishment detests Trump as much as the Democratic one does. Yet, lo and behold, Trump’s the Republican Party’s presidential nominee. And, veiled truth be told, Trump’s polling ahead of Clinton. That’s an astonishing exception to a century of exclusive political domination. 

What that should tell Middle America is that Trump has energized -- across party lines -- a coalition of the politically disenfranchised American electorate. That’s mostly white, middle-class, working men and women whom academia hasn't yet terminally brainwashed. There are still enough of them to make a difference. But there won't be after eight years of a Clinton presidency because, by its end, we'll have another 30 million Latin American, African, and Middle-Eastern interlopers voting here.

What Trump can do -- if he has the leadership balls -- during an eight-year presidency is force the Republican Party to realize its real constituency is a newly energized political opposition of the disenfranchised unprivileged class. That, and also deny a Clinton presidency the opportunity to forever overwhelm the traditional American electorate with 30 million refugees from the world's failed states.

Can Trump do it? Will he do it? Is it already too late? Nobody knows. But Clinton sure as hell won't do it, Trump's all the unprivileged class has left, and the margin by which his popular vote may exceed his smaller electoral vote is the margin by which the Republican Party may potentially be convinced to banish its Paul Ryans and become -- for the first time in the last century -- a real party in actual political opposition.

That's why Middle America should hold its nose as much as necessary, get off its derriere, and go vote for Trump. Remember, ladies, your fathers and husbands are men, and half your offspring are too. Remember, African Americans, your dysfunctional schools and crime-ridden ghettos are the consequence of a centralized political duopoly that has made many of you mere dependents of the state. Remember, Hispanics, tens of millions of your brethren illegally here merely depress the wages of those of you legally here. Remember, corporate America, when the Chinese stop buying America’s metastasizing debt, you’re going offshore more than you ever bargained for.  

Otherwise, we'll all ultimately find ourselves kicking the severed head of our own Marquis de Launay around our own version of the Place de Grève. And drinking the blood of our fellow citizens.

The only reasonable response of good men and women everywhere is it's never too late.

Until, of course, it is.

And then Napoleon succeeds Doctor Guillotine.

As Santayana said, ""when experience is not retained, as among savages, infancy is perpetual. Those who cannot remember the past are condemned to repeat it.""

100256,1008,The Fracas From Caracas,http://www.americanthinker.com/articles/2016/10/the_fracas_from_caracas.html,10,"Sandra Fluke's plaintive moaning (to advance the Democrats' plan to shove Obamacare down our gullets) about the difficulties college girls have trying to pay for contraceptives ran its course. Indeed, Obamacare itself is on its last legs. Like Cindy Sheehan, Fluke’s now on the back shelf in the left’s propaganda storage room. The Clinton team searched for someone new -- this time to push its stale Republicans-are-misogynists theme and settled upon Alicia Machado, a former Miss Universe from Venezuela. Since summer they’ve been grooming her for this starring role in a Clinton campaign lacking in appealing issues. Without apparently vetting her, they set her up with an interview in the Guardian and arranged a photo spread with Cosmopolitan, the magazine for entry level young women looking to climb the ladder of success through bosses’ bedrooms using diets, expensive grooming, and Cosmo seduction techniques. The story was embargoed till this week when the publications let loose and Clinton super PAC Priorities USA created and promoted the story to the media courtiers.

This year’s appeal to such dimwits and overweight women voters -- through the Machado fandango -- is that Trump “fat shamed” the gal -- another un-PC act in media circles where half-dressed sylphs in revealing cleavage and plenty of leg read the news and heavily made up slender 13-year-old girls in bikinis grace magazine covers.

Unfortunately, few outside the Internet know the story is 100% false, and there’s plenty of contemporaneous evidence to prove that -- even if one assumes this takes precedence over Hillary’s and Obama’s failures in substantive matters. (I really do think journalism students should be required to take a course called “How to Google”.) The New York Times, by way of example, ran this headline “Shocked and Angry: Alicia Machado, a Miss Universe Mocked by Donald Trump”.

Here’s what turned up about Miss Machado and her treatment by Trump

1. Prior to being named Miss Universe in 1997, she had an eating disorder, anorexia and bulimia. She conceded as much then.

After she was named Miss Universe she packed on 60 pounds in a matter of months. Whether or not you care if women are fat, her contract, as is normal for beauty queens, required her to remain beautiful and slender and she was about to lose her crown. Trump didn’t shame her -- instead he tried to help her lose weight and retain her crown. You can believe these sources or your own eyes -- here’s the contemporaneous video showing Machado cheering on Trump as he helps her lose weight and fat shames the reporters who had been attacking her for putting on weight. 

In any event were I teaching in journalism school, I’d make How to Google a mandatory course because it turns out that after the Miss Universe gig, Machado's life took such a turn as to raise questions about how she attained citizenship under 8 CFR Sec 316 “Good Moral Character”.

Fausta, who knows a thing or two about Venezuela, details Machado’s post-title behavior:

Machado:

allegedly drove the getaway car when her then-boyfriend shot a man,
threatened to kill the judge who found the same then-boyfriend guilty of attempted murder,
had sex on TV with a fellow cast member of Spain’s version of Big Brother, La Granja, while engaged to MLB player Bobby Abreu,
gave birth to a daughter allegedly sired by drug lord José Gerardo Álvarez, “el Indio” -- who was connected to both the Beltrán Leyva and Los Negros cartels,
and her daughter’s christening was attended Beltrán Leyva cartel bigwigs Arturo Beltrán Leyva, the “Jefe de Jefes”, his brother Héctor Beltrán, and hitman Edgar Valdés Villarreal, “La Barbie” (related posts here).
By the way, what happened to the guy who first revealed the information on the christening party?  He was killed while having lunch at a cafe prior to when he was scheduled to testify on the Beltrán Leyva case.

In the words of the great Mark Steyn in another context: 

""This kind of super-fake-o lame-ass nothing controversy that you dowager duchesses of the press are having the vapors about is precisely why the political process has fallen into such disrepute and your own industry is bankrupt. No real person cares about this ""scandal"". So, unless you've got a question about the economy or immigration or something real, screw off outta here."" 

With this week’s stupid distraction out of the way, let me highlight just a few of the reasons why voters have every reason to treat the political elite with contempt and seek to displace them with an outsider with executive experience and a respect for the bottom line.

The deputy secretary of State testified before Congress that the administration doesn’t have a plan for dealing with the chaos in Syria -- something directly attributable to the topping of Gadhafi at Clinton’s hand and our support for various thuggish terrorist groups in Syria:  

Read his gibberish in response to a question by Senator Corker:

“What is Plan B? Give me the elements of Plan B.”

“Two things, again. The consequences I think to Russia as well as to the regime will begin to be felt as a result of Plan A not being implemented,” Blinken reiterated. “Second, as I indicated the President has asked all of the agencies to put forward options, some familiar, some new, that we are very actively reviewing.”

“When we are able to work through those in the days ahead, we will be able to come back and talk about them,” he admitted.

“Let me just say what we already know,” Corker said in closing. “There is no Plan B.”

I don’t have a plan either, but I’m not paid not to have one.

Ignorance was also on display when Jeh Johnson was questioned about how 800 -- or was it 1800? -- aliens to be deported were granted citizenship by mistake:

He told Congress he didn’t have the exact number of those granted citizenship in error or how many were from countries known to be terrorist havens.

As for the “vetting of “refugees” of which Hillary plans to bring even more tens of thousands in this country, we had an eye-opener this week when Senator Jeff Sessions (R-AL) grilled Principal Deputy Assistant Secretary of Population, Refugees, and Migrants of the U.S. Department of State Simon Henshaw in the Senate Judiciary Committee hearing. We learned there really is no vetting.

Sessions: “Do you take into consideration the applicant’s proficiency in English or even their literacy with regard to the country from which they come?”

Henshaw: “Our decisions to bring in refugees are based on their vulnerabilities.”

Sessions: “Do you make any inquiry about practices that we reject in the United States like female genital mutilation? Do you say, ‘do you believe in that and when you come to the United States will you comply with the laws of the United States on that kind of question?’”

Henshaw: “On all questions, we make it clear to refugees that we are a nation of laws and that they need to comply with our laws.”

Sessions: “But you don’t ask them whether they would comply with that law?”

Henshaw: “I can’t answer that question I don’t know.”

Indeed, we learned learned from Leon Rodriquez, director of Citizenship  and Immigration Services at DHS, that a recipe for fraud is built into the process:

“Mr. Rodriguez,” Cruz interrupted, “it’s a very simple question… Is it true or false that the testimony of the applicant alone can be sufficient for approval?”

Rodriguez hedged until Cruz finally secured an answer.

“I am acknowledging that yes, testimony can be the basis for the grant of a refugee, but it needs to be tested against other information that we know -- about the country conditions, at a minimum,” he said. 

It’s an administration whose idiocy and word salad pronouncements would seem to have been created by the late author Joseph Heller.

This week’s capper was FBI director James Comey’s admission that he didn’t know why the Department of Justice granted immunity to Hillary’s accomplices in her illegal use and scrubbing (even while under subpoenas to produce) of her private email service and communications -- an act by which Attorney General Lynch effectively granted Hillary herself immunity from prosecution. That he still sits as head of the FBI is a mark of his moral cowardice.

No wonder, Hillary’s team -- the team that promises to give us more of the same -- is desperate for sexy diversions.

100257,1008,Class vs. American Exceptionalism,http://www.americanthinker.com/articles/2016/10/class_vs_american_exceptionalism.html,10,"The nonexistence of a class structure is one of the foremost reasons why Americans lead the world.  In many cases, ""class"" means separation of people into haves and have-nots.  Because of the absence of class, we are not hampered by restrictions left over from the feudal era.  That leaves us free to partake of the benefits of the world without the chains binding us to the past.

In my hometown in West Virginia, during the Great Depression, women who were immigrants from Europe refused to personally clean their houses.  They paid someone else to do it even though everyone was short of money.  They were imbued with the European class structure, which forbad such lower-class work.  Americans, who don't use such restrictions, can achieve so much more.

Because of the equality of all, every necessary endeavor in life was to figure out ways of making life easier for all activities.  House cleaning was only a problem to solve.  Vacuum cleaners were invented to solve that problem.  Better and sturdier mops appeared.  All kinds of equipment for cleaning became a part of life.  Sales of these tools made fortunes for their producers.  Money was important to the ""classed"" but not important enough to lose their class restrictions.

In Europe, there was never any effort to assist the housecleaning chore.  The lower class just had to adjust to the burden of being born to serve.

Another example of American success is the automobile.  Few could afford a Rolls-Royce, but the elite could because they were born to affluence.  Americans could provide cars for workers, and Henry Ford proceeded to furnish them. 

In America, millions of purchasers were able to buy whatever the market produced.  That was our treasure: workers who could buy things.  The more people we hire, the more buyers we supply to the economy.

Construction became a major industry.  Buildings were being built all over America.  The invention of chainsaws and cement were only the beginning of a revolution in America.  Big cities were the allure for jobs and culture.

Colleges sprang up all over the country.  Education in all fields held promise due to the absence of a restrictive class system.

We have made buyers from all walks of life, by accepting people as equals and rejecting a class system.

A woman who became the first manager of the trading post on a nearby Indian reservation in the early part of the 20th century would take  any job that helped her succeed and earn an adequate living.  She figured out a way to learn the Indian language by trading words from the Sears Roebuck catalog with one of her customers.  She made historical quilts, which are in the local museum.  A typical American, nothing deterred her.

When a baby was born to the lower class, his future was already determined.  One's birth placed one into either doing manual labor or having someone else committed to doing it.  Daily life depended on the services of the lower class, and blood was the only determinant.

Blood was the one established factor in life among the lower classes.  At birth, one's life was foretold until death.

In America, one could not determine what the future would bring.  There were no class restrictions on hopes for the future.  One would try anything to succeed in solving a problem.  There is nothing more satisfying than winning over an obstacle.  That is why we do puzzles.

In Europe, the upper class never performed what they considered menial labor.  It was degrading.  One learned to order its completion, but never to execute it.

The rest of the world, could not engage in change.  However, Americans seized the opportunity for change without the restrictions of class or tribe.

There is still plenty of evidence of worldwide classism, which sometimes strays into American life.

A friend who told me of her life as the wife of a graduate student at a leading American university and told how they lived in a row of apartments.  Next door lived an Indian graduate student with his Indian wife.  The wife was a class and caste person from India who had been raised in an upper-class household and exhibited all the characteristics of being upper-class.  She had no idea how to take care of the apartment and do the usual American chores with which we are familiar.  My friend tried to help her, but it was difficult because the Indian lady had never done any of those chores for herself.  She had been cared for by servants and had no idea what it took to keep her alive.

An American physician has been trying to teach a new member of her medical practice about the chores required to serve in that practice.  The Indian doctor is refusing to do certain of these chores, which she considers not part of what she is disposed to do.  Her upper-class background interferes with her ability to perform those chores she considers beneath her class.  How can she doctor in a world where one does not refuse to care for all in the best way possible?

These upper-class restraints are still alive and well in various parts of the world.  They hamper the performance of achieving success in making life better for all peoples.  American experience succeeded in making a superior society we all enjoy, which others envy.

Life is impossible to survive these days in an insular society where the lower class performs all the chores related to existence.  The upper class has lost its role.

These days, immediate performance is necessary to save lives.  And how boring it is to have everything done for you.

100258,1009,“BOMBSHELL”: TRUMP LOST A LOT OF MONEY IN 1995 [UPDATED],http://www.powerlineblog.com/archives/2016/10/bombshell-trump-lost-a-lot-of-money-in-1995.php,10,"The New York Times thinks Donald Trump’s tax returns are “a central issue in the campaign.” Others would disagree, but today the Times did what it can to distract voters from Hillary Clinton’s record by publishing three pages of Trump tax returns from 1995, 21 years ago.

The Times explains that someone anonymously mailed the three pages to one of its reporters. They are the front pages from Trump’s New York, Connecticut and New Jersey state tax returns, all from 1995. No IRS documents are included. The returns themselves would have been much more substantial, perhaps hundreds of pages long, but we see only the top-line summary, here.

The supposed bombshell disclosure is that in 1995, Mr. and Mrs. Trump recorded a federal adjusted gross income of -$915,729,293. I assume that loss related in large part to the collapse of the casino and hotel market in Atlantic City, which the Times reported on in another anti-Trump screed. As Trump himself said, “Welcome to the real estate business.”

So, what’s the point? The Times breathlessly proclaims that Trump’s 1995 loss was “so substantial it could have allowed him to legally avoid paying any federal income taxes for up to 18 years.” The Times is simply citing the federal tax code as it existed in 1995: net operating losses could be carried back three years and forward 15 years. (Today, it would be three years back and 20 years forward.) This has nothing to do with how “substantial” the loss was, it simply is how the Internal Revenue Code treats business losses.

The Times tries to suggest, but doesn’t actually say, that Trump may have paid no federal income taxes since 1995:

Although Mr. Trump’s taxable income in subsequent years is as yet unknown, a $916 million loss in 1995 would have been large enough to wipe out more than $50 million a year in taxable income over 18 years.

The $916 million loss certainly could have eliminated any federal income taxes Mr. Trump otherwise would have owed on the $50,000 to $100,000 he was paid for each episode of “The Apprentice,” or the roughly $45 million he was paid between 1995 and 2009 when he was chairman or chief executive of the publicly traded company he created to assume ownership of his troubled Atlantic City casinos.

Given that Forbes believes Trump to have a net worth of $4.5 billion, it seems safe to assume that in the intervening 21 years he has made more than enough money to eat up the $916 million loss carry-forward.

But perhaps not. Perhaps Trump’s wealth consists almost entirely of unrealized real estate appreciation (much as, for example, Warren Buffett’s wealth consists overwhelmingly of unrealized stock appreciation). He and his companies pay, of course, vast amounts of real estate taxes, but he wouldn’t owe income taxes on appreciated assets until he sells his interest. So what?

The Times concedes that “[t]he tax experts consulted by The Times said nothing in the 1995 documents suggested any wrongdoing by Mr. Trump.” Trump does what we all do: he gives his accountant boxes full of documents, and his accountant figures out how much tax he owes. Does the Times think its principal owner, the Mexican multi-billionaire Carlos Slim, pays more in taxes than he owes?

One last observation: unable to offer any evidence of wrongdoing, the Times emphasizes the extraordinary benefit that Trump supposedly gained from losing $916 million in 1995–it was “tax write-off gold.” As though it were a clever ploy to lose $916 million, in hopes of setting off the loss against future income! As usual, the Times relies on its readers’ ignorance and credulity.

UPDATE: Drudge is headlining this Breitbart report on taxes paid (or not paid) by the New York Times:

[T]he Times itself has “avoided” paying taxes — in 2014, for example.

As Forbes noted at the time:

…for tax year 2014, The New York Times paid no taxes and got an income tax refund of $3.5 million even though they had a pre-tax profit of $29.9 million in 2014. In other words, their post-tax profit was higher than their pre-tax profit. The explanation in their 2014 annual report is, “The effective tax rate for 2014 was favorably affected by approximately $21.1 million for the reversal of reserves for uncertain tax positions due to the lapse of applicable statutes of limitations.”

In plain English, that means that the Times had set aside money as a reserve in case the IRS came after it, disputing aggressive income tax positions the paper had taken in prior years. When the statute of limitations ran out so that the IRS could no longer contest the Times’s “uncertain” deductions, the paper recorded a profit. Well done, tax accountants and lawyers!

It does make you wonder, though, whether Barack Obama’s politicized IRS is deliberately failing to enforce the tax laws against pro-Democrat taxpayers like the Times. It would be worth a lot of money to the Democratic Party to keep the Times in business despite its poor financial performance."

100260,1009,SUNDAY MORNING COMING DOWN,http://www.powerlineblog.com/archives/2016/10/sunday-morning-coming-down-39.php,10,"Writing about Hillary Clinton “behind closed doors” yesterday reminded me, of course, of the fabulous Charlie Rich (as one of his albums called him). It seems like an opportune moment to recall him and acquaint you with a few of his songs with which you might not be familiar.

As a presenter at the Country Music Association awards in 1975, at the height of his career, Charlie Rich committed a drunken act of music criticism. When he opened the envelope to announce the winner of the Entertainer of the Year award — the award he himself had won the previous year — he found the name of Johh Denver. After announcing the winner (“my good friend John Denver”), Rich set the certificate naming him on fire. In terms of commercial appeal, Rich’s career never quite regained its footing. (Last year Andrew Kirell presented a differing interpretation of this incident.)

Rich’s career extended back to Sam Phillips’s Sun Records, where he was signed in 1958 as a session musician. Phillips is the legendary Memphis studio owner and producer who signed Elvis Presley, Jerry Lee Lewis, Johnny Cash, Roy Orbison, and Carl Perkins. I can’t think of anyone who has had a better ear for great American pop music than Phillips. His assessment should count for something in this context: “I don’t think I ever recorded anyone who was better as a singer, writer, and player than Charlie Rich.”

Rich was born in 1932 in eastern Arkansas near Memphis. He grew up on a farm there in a musical family and learned to play blues piano from a black sharecropper named C.J. Allen. In Arkansas he fell in love with Margaret Ann Greene, an attractive neighbor who shared his passion for music in general and jazz in particular. Rich tried college briefly, enlisted in the Air Force, and was married to Margaret Ann while serving in Oklahoma. There they began performing professionally together in a group called the Velvetones. After his Air Force service Rich returned to Arkansas and tried farming while his wife helped him pursue his musical interests. By 1958 he was working for Sun and recording with Sun artists including Lewis and Cash.

In 1960 he had his first hit, an Elvis rockabilly knock-off called “Lonely Weekends.” His follow-up recordings with Sun failed to generate any interest. His own “Who Will the Next Fool Be” (below) comes from the Sun years; country wasn’t ready for him yet but you can hear what it was missing. In 1964 he left Sun and recorded with sporadic success on a succession of labels until he was signed by Epic Records on the recommendation of producer Billy Sherrill, who knew Rich from working with him at Sun. All of Rich’s recordings evidence his love for country, blues, gospel, jazz, and soul music. Like Elvis and Ray Charles, he loved great songs of all kinds, whatever the source. In Rich’s case, however, the genre-bending had hindered his career. Sherrill more narrowly fashioned Rich as a smooth country ballad singer, surrounded him with Sherrill’s gooey “countrypolitan” sound, and launched Rich to the heights of his career with the 1973 worldwide number one crossover hit “Behind Closed Doors.”

Ray Charles happened to be the presenter when Rich won the Favorite Country Artist award at the 1975 American Music Awards. In his brief remarks accepting the award, Rich acknowledged his debt to Charles: “Ladies and gentlemen, I don’t know exactly what to say. This man changed country music to where I could sing it. Thank God he presented me with this award.”

If you know Rich only from his smash hits of these years, you don’t really know him. Margaret Ann wrote one of his best non-smash songs of this period — the starkly autobiographical “Life’s Little Ups and Downs” (below). Throughout his career he brought his incredibly expressive voice to great songs such as “Set Me Free,” “Don’t Put No Headstone on My Grave,” “Feel Like Going Home,” “Sittin’ and Thinkin’,” and “Peace on You.” Let’s take a listen to “Life’s Little Ups and Downs,” written, as I say, for him by his wife. The production dates it, but I think it’s fair to say that this song stands the test of time. Elvis biographer Peter Guralnick is the essential chronicler of Rich’s career. With Rich’s cooperation Guralnick wrote painfully honest profiles of Rich in each of his first two collections of music profiles, Feel Like Going Home and Lost Highway.

Guralnick must have had a special bond with Rich; in 1992 Guralnick enticed him out of semi-retirement to record Pictures & Paintings, his last album and a beautiful recap of his career. (The place to begin is the lovingly compiled 1997 two-disc retrospective Feel Like Going Home: The Essential Charlie Rich.)

The demo of his own “Feel Like Going Home” (below) comes from Guralnick’s compilation. As Rich accompanies himself alone on the piano, you can really hear the depth of his artistry. "
100261,1010,Trump appears to tell supporters to form roving voter intimidation squads,https://thinkprogress.org/trump-appears-to-tell-supporters-to-form-roving-voter-intimidation-squads-5c15faac7a39#.yv54g3865,10,"Speaking at a rally in Manheim, Pennsylvania on Saturday, Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump offered vague concerns about “bad stories” in “certain areas” where efforts to rig the election could take place. Though the overtly racist candidate was circumspect about what his supporters should do in these “certain areas,” he appeared to suggest that they should join together into roaming squads of vigilantes.
You’ve got to go out. You’ve got to go out. And you’ve got to get your friends. And you’ve got to get everyone you know. And you got to watch your polling booths, because I hear too many stories about Pennsylvania. Certain areas. I hear too many bad stories, and we can’t lose an election because of you know what I’m talking about.
So go and vote, and then go check out areas. Because a lot of bad things happen. And we don’t want to lose for that reason. We don’t want to lose, but we especially we don’t want to lose for that reason. So go over and_—_watch. And watch carefully.
America has a long and unfortunate history of angry white mobs traveling to predominantly African American polling places in order to intimidate voters. The Ku Klux Klan started using this tactic not long after the Civil War.
Even if Trump’s supporters do not continue this legacy of intimidation on Election Day, however, Trump’s vague allusions to rigged elections plays into a much broader strategy embraced by the Republican Party in recent elections. In August, for example, Trump claimed that the election “is going to be rigged,” citing a string of court decisions invalidating voter suppression laws in a few states. “I don’t like what’s going on with voter ID,” Trump added. “I mean the voter ID situation has turned out to be a very unfair development. We may have people vote 10 times.”
Voter ID is one of the most common forms of voter suppression embraced by Republican lawmakers in recent years. Though these laws are often justified as necessary to combat voter fraud, as Trump attempts to do, the kind of fraud prevented by these laws_—_voter impersonation at the polls_—_barely exists. To cite just one of numerous investigations confirming this fact, Iowa’s Republican Secretary of State conducted a two-year investigation into voter fraud. He uncovered zero cases of voter impersonation at the polls.
What voter ID does accomplish, however, is it shifts the overall electorate rightward. Indeed, one study determined that that “Democratic turnout drops by an estimated 8.8 percentage points in general elections when strict photo identification laws are in place,” compared to 3.6 percentage points for Republicans.
Yet, while Trump and other Republicans’ claims about widespread voter fraud are false, they have succeeded in ginning up fears that this election may not have a legitimate result. Polls show that a significant minority of the country does not believe that November’s election results will be reliable. Meanwhile, Trump himself suggested on Friday that he may continue to fan these flames even if he loses in November. After interviewers from the New York Times asked Trump whether he was “rethinking his statement at their last debate that he would ‘absolutely’ support her if she won in November,” Trump responded “We’re going to have to see. We’re going to see what happens. We’re going to have to see.” "
100262,1010,Trump campaign spins Trump’s nearly billion dollar loss as ‘genius’,https://thinkprogress.org/trump-campaign-spins-trumps-nearly-billion-dollar-loss-as-genius-3e986436907e#.hqlwxejpu,10,"If you watched a Sunday morning news show this weekend, you saw one of two Trump surrogates: New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie (R) or former New York City Mayor Rudy Giuliani (R). Both men spoke from the same talking point_—_Donald Trump is a “genius” if he does not pay taxes.
Saturday evening, the New York Times reported that Donald Trump lost nearly $1 billion in 1995, based on tax documents mailed to a Times reporter. As the Times explains, such a gargantuan loss “could have allowed him to legally avoid paying any federal income taxes for up to 18 years,” because Trump can count losses in 1995 against future income in subsequent tax years.
Both Christie and Giuliani had the same spin on Trump’s ability to use his massive losses to offset tax liability in later years. “There’s no one who’s shown more genius in their way to maneuver about the tax code as he rightfully used the laws to do that,” Christie told Fox News’ Chris Wallace. “The man is a genius!” Giuliani proclaimed. “He knows how to operate the tax code.”
Both men also argued that there is nothing illegal about Trump offsetting future income with the truly spectacular losses he took in 1995. On this point, they are correct. Businesses frequently have boom years and bust years, and it would be unfair to prohibit a business from accounting for its past losses in its current year’s tax return. A different rule would potentially discourage businesses from planning for the long term, because the proceeds from investments that took years to pay out could effectively be taxed at a much higher rate than the proceeds from other, short-term gains.
Trump’s colossal 1995 losses, however, do not appear to stem from some kind of long-term investment strategy. Rather, as the Times explains, they “derived from the financial wreckage he left behind in the early 1990s through mismanagement of three Atlantic City casinos, his ill-fated foray into the airline business and his ill-timed purchase of the Plaza Hotel in Manhattan.”
Trump, in other words, made several very bad business decisions_—_at a time when the United States economy was otherwise doing fairly well_—_and those bad decisions came back to bite him in 1995, costing him nearly a billion dollars.
Genius!"
100263,1010,7 tweets by Trump about taxes that are very awkward now,https://thinkprogress.org/7-tweets-by-trump-about-taxes-that-are-very-awkward-now-75b500ea4f45#.wtxbhcjch,10,"A blockbuster New York Times story revealed that Trump probably did not pay federal income taxes for two decades or longer.
Trump’s lawyers threatened to sue the New York Times if they published the story. But now that it’s out neither Trump nor his campaign are denying its premise.
Taxes are a subject Trump weighs in on frequently on Twitter. Now that more is known about Trump’s taxes, these tweets seem ill advised.
Trump slammed Obama for paying “only” 20.5% of his income in taxes.
 Trump criticized other Americans, mostly low income people, for not paying income taxes.
 Trump criticized a billionaire for avoiding paying federal taxes. Trump bragged about how much he pays in taxes. Trump tweeted that “successful people” are “punished by heavy taxes.” When Trump bashed Amazon for not paying “fair taxes.” Trump complained about an Obama speech because he helped pay for it with his taxes.

100264,1001,It's not just a 'bad week': Donald Trump's campaign is collapsing,http://www.dailykos.com/stories/2016/10/3/1577398/-It-s-not-just-a-bad-week-Donald-Trump-s-campaign-is-collapsing#read-more,11,"Donald Trump has just come off the worst week in modern political history—almost all of it self-inflicted. And what's shocking about it is that nearly every individual part of it would have been campaign-ending in any other election, for any other candidate.

It started with a predictably terrible debate performance. This itself is not unusual or even unexpected; it seems the Trump campaign was being sincere when they claimed their candidate was not preparing for the debate, and so Trump came out onstage and happily proceeded to spend the evening being the worst version of himself, simultaneously belligerent and hopelessly uninformed. Clinton was easily able to get under his skin—and did so to the point that her reference to a former Miss Universe that Trump had demeaned became, for Trump, his own dominant campaign theme for the next week.

By Friday, the Republican nominee for the presidency of the United States was on wee-hours-of-the-morning Twitter to instruct Americans to ""check out"" her ""sex tape.""

That was just the beginning.

• The New York Times was sent partial 1995 tax returns for Donald Trump showing that he had claimed nearly a billion dollars in business losses that year—a loss which probably reduced Trump's federal tax bill to zero for nearly every year since.

• It was discovered that Trump's company launched an effort to explore business opportunities in Cuba, in violation of U.S. laws supporting the Cuba embargo.

• It was discovered that Trump's charitable foundation, already under scrutiny for using donor money to purchase items seemingly meant for Trump personally, had never obtained the proper state license for soliciting charitable donations. By this Monday, the New York attorney general's office sent a cease and desist order requiring the foundation to stop all such solicitation efforts.

• It was discovered that Trump did business with an Iranian bank U.S. officials have charged with having ties to terrorism.

Are you a member of MoveOn? No matter where you live, help defeat Donald Trump and take back the Senate by texting MoveOn members in swing states to knock on doors where they live.  

• Reports resurfaced of Trump's loathsome treatment of female employees in his companies, including a lawsuit alleging he demanded women he deemed not attractive enough be fired and replaced with women who were. A new Associated Press report detailed equally grotesque behavior during Trump's filming of The Apprentice.

• Papers across the nation broke against their own historical leanings to deny Trump their endorsements, including USA Today's decision to weigh in on the presidential race for the first time in their history, in an editorial that called Trump unfit for the office.

Trump's response to his own poor debate performance, as well as to the tax revelations, has been extraordinarily unhinged. A surrogate could make excuses for past business dealings; it is impossible to dismiss the candidate’s toxic rantings while he continues to ramp up those rantings by saying things that are even worse.

In addition to telling the American citizenry to check out a detractor's ""sex tape,” by Saturday night's stump speech he launched into a mocking parody of his opponent's bout with pneumonia, the declaration that ""she could actually be crazy"" and the accusation that ""I don't even think she's loyal to Bill, if you want to know the truth."" It was an effort that had political observers bewildered and all-but-openly questioning the man's sanity.

As if that were not enough, he also came forward with angry hints that he may or may not accept the results of the November election at all.

His surrogates have done him no favors. In response to reports of Trump's billion-dollar business loss, campaign hangers-on Rudy Giuliani and Chris Christie both called him a ""genius"" for being able to reduce his tax burden so substantially. Repeatedly surrogates have intoned that references to Trump's past sexism will now be met with references to Bill Clinton's infidelities. And today the Republican Party approvingly tweeted out a report that they would be launching a ""Willie Horton-Style Attack"" on the Democrats, referencing a campaign commercial so race-baiting that even now it is referred to as prime example of the genre.

Of all these things, any one of about half of them could be considered campaign-ending in any other year. Other candidates have been dismembered in the press for having affairs or for tax errors involving their nannies; the Republican candidate this year is telling Americans to watch sex tapes, accusing his opponent of infidelity and has a charitable ""foundation"" so sketchy that it's been given a cease and desist order for not being a licensed charity at all.

This is no longer just grading on a curve. This is lunacy. If it were discovered that the Clinton Foundation didn't even have the proper documents to solicit charitable contributions the sea of reporters crashing against her campaign headquarters would reach the third-floor windows. The man has proven himself plainly unfit for the presidency in a half-dozen different ways and venues.

This is unprecedented. And it goes well beyond simply having a bad week."

Bizarre and off message, since his campaign has been going ever deeper into attacks on Clinton because of the reverse, blaming her for her husband’s long-ago infidelity. “You know, I think Donald Trump shows Americans every day how low a campaign he is running,” Clinton campaign adviser Joel Benenson said on MSNBC. 

“I think there’s — there seems to be no limit to the shameless lows Donald Trump can go to in this campaign,” Benenson continued, “and we're not gonna address any of those things he does. He mocked a disabled reporter. He mocked her the other night for being ill when she had pneumonia.”
Translation: While we may not have actively handed Trump this particular piece of rope, we’re just going to sit back and watch him hang himself with it.

Prominent Trump campaign surrogate Rudy Giuliani was more on message on Sunday than Trump was on Saturday night. It’s just a creepy, vile message. Giuliani, a past adulterer out campaigning for a past adulterer, was confronted with that particular bit of hypocrisy by Chuck Todd (!) saying “You have your own infidelities, sir.” “Everybody does,” Giuliani responded, later explaining that some of us cheat on our wives and others lie or otherwise sin and it’s all infidelity.

When asked why, if all people commit sins, he felt that raising the issue of Mr. Clinton’s infidelity is fair game, he said: “I’m not attacking the Clintons. I’m attacking Hillary.”

He made clear that the decision to resurrect the issue of Mr. Clinton’s affairs — and Mrs. Clinton’s attacks on the credibility of women who made claims of sexual impropriety — is linked to her raising Mr. Trump’s treatment of a former Miss Universe, Alicia Machado, in the final moments of the debate.

“If she would like to stop attacking on things that happened 20 years ago, he’ll stop attacking things that happened 20 years ago,” Mr. Giuliani said.

He added, “I don’t know if it is a winning or losing strategy, but if you get attacked, you have to defend yourself.”
That’s the Trump campaign in a nutshell. We’re not attacking the person who did the thing, we’re attacking a person who was hurt by the thing, because that happens to be who we want to attack. We’re blindly lashing out because we’re losing and because we definitely can’t be challenged by a woman without going low and personal. We don't get that there’s a difference between something that happened 20 years ago that everyone already knows about and new information about something Donald Trump did 20 years ago and can be relied on to do again and again and again right now.

But that’s what happens when a narcissistic bully like Trump surrounds himself with people like himself—Giuliani, Roger Ailes, Chris Christie, Newt Gingrich. They think as long as they’re attacking, they’re winning, and that the rest of the country will hate women as much as they do."
100266,1001,Donald Trump rented offices to Iranian bank that was funding terrorists and stealing nuclear secrets,http://www.dailykos.com/stories/2016/10/3/1577247/-Donald-Trump-rented-offices-to-Iranian-bank-that-was-funding-terrorists-and-stealing-nuclear-secrets#read-more,11,"Donald Trump has nearly infinite ties to Russia. He illegally spent money in Cuba. And to complete the set, Donald Trump rented space to an Iranian bank—one that has ties to terrorism.

Donald Trump’s real estate organization rented New York office space from 1998 to 2003 to an Iranian bank that U.S. authorities have linked to terrorist groups and Iran’s nuclear program. …

U.S. officials later alleged that Bank Melli had been used to obtain sensitive materials for Iran’s nuclear program. U.S. authorities also alleged that the bank had been used between 2002 and 2006 to funnel money to a unit of the Iranian Revolutionary Guard that has sponsored terrorist attacks — a period that overlapped with the time the bank rented office space from Trump.
It’s another instance where Trump’s extensive business ties put the Trump organization and the American government in potential conflict. Like the hundreds of millions that Trump owes troubled Deutsche Bank, and the hundreds of millions more he owes to The Bank of China. 

The Trump Organization’s dealings with the Iranian bank shed more light on Trump’s wide-ranging business interests, which sometimes stand at odds with his blunt declarations on the campaign trail. Trump has denounced Iran as a “big enemy,” blasted Hillary Clinton for not taking a harder line against the Iranian regime and charged that donations from foreign governments to the Clinton Foundation amounted to evidence of corruption. His five-year stint as Bank Melli’s landlord provides an example of the Trump Organization itself doing business with a government hostile to the United States.
Hillary Clinton allowed foreign sources to put money into helping people around the world. Donald Trump allowed foreign sources to put money in his pocket. 

Beyond winning the White House, we must also elect more progressive Democrats in Congress. With the PCCC and Daily Kos, you can now make phone calls to voters in the key districts that will get us more and better Democrats. Click here to start.

Unlike Trump’s dealings in Cuba, which were simply illegal, what Trump was doing with Bank Melli may have squeezed through a loophole.

At the time, the U.S. had a sweeping embargo in place which prohibited Americans from doing business with Iran, including receiving rent payments. However, some Iranian organizations were granted licenses exempting specific transactions from sanctions.
Both Bank Melli and the Trump Organization have declined to make a statement about whether the bank had such a license. The Trump campaign also declined to make a comment.

While Donald Trump was happy to take Iran’s check, he had other ideas about what we should do to the country.

At the time, Donald Trump called for the U.S. take a tougher line against the Iranian regime.

In 1987, he suggested in a speech in New Hampshire that the U.S. should attack Iran and seize some of its oil fields to hit back for what he described as Iran’s bullying of America.
Trump’s “take the oil” plan has two major problems: it’s impossible, and it’s a war crime. But Trump has been fixed on the idea for 30 years … so at least there is some bit of consistency in his foreign policy."
100267,1002,Clinton Scandal Update,http://www.breitbart.com/hillary-clinton/2016/10/03/clinton-scandal-update/,11,"Hillary Clinton’s use of an email server in the basement of her home while she was secretary of state will leave a permanent stain on our system of justice and on the public’s trust in government.
This became abundantly clear during our “Clinton Scandal Update – Emails and the Clinton Foundation” symposium held here in Washington on September 29, 2016.  The full video is available here – and is well worth watching and sharing.

Chris Farrell, our director of investigations, and I were joined by three distinguished experts: WND senior staff writer Jerome Corsi, author of Partners in Crime: The Clinton’s Scheme to Monetize the White House for Personal Profit; Peter Schweizer, author of the New York Times best-seller Clinton Cash; and Joseph E. diGenova, former United States Attorney for the District of Columbia.

Peter Schweizer pointed out that the Clintons’ pay-for-play scandal sets “an extremely dangerous precedent. This is about more than the Clintons,” he said. “If it is not dealt with in a legal manner, it’s going to be imitated.” He also noted that this scandal dwarfs anything we have seen before in terms of efforts to hide what was occurring and in the sheer amount of money involved.

Chris Farrell spoke of the permanent damage done to the reputation of the FBI by Director James Comey’s negligence. “Mr. Comey is personally compromised,” he said. “The institution won’t get over it.” As you know, before joining Judicial Watch Chris worked in national intelligence. He pointed out that we know of at least 22 emails crossing Clinton’s unsecure server that contained “sensitive compartmented information,” a high level of classification. “This puts the United States at grave risk. Any first class intelligence organization would be looking for that kind of information.”

Jerome Corsi described how enormous sums of money that flowed into the Clinton Foundation cannot be accounted for. “Tens of millions of dollars were diverted,” he asserted.  There is a discrepancy between what people gave the foundation and what it reported. “The Clintons ended up with net worths of 100 million dollars each.” And the speaking engagements don’t begin to account for it, he said. Joe diGenova came down hard on FBI Director James Comey. “I do not believe Comey is fit to continue in office. His arrogance and obfuscation should disqualify anyone with the power the FBI has. He violated his oath. It is very clear that from the moment he took control of this investigation he decided he was not going to recommend prosecution. It was a political decision.”

I added that Congress has refused to take any kind of substantive action on the scandal. “Congress is refusing to take steps to hold Mrs. Clinton accountable. Why isn’t there a contempt citation pending now? Emails were destroyed after they were subpoenaed. Congressmen don’t want accountability to get in their way of retaining the Congress. I’m talking about the Republicans.”

I also noted that civil service employees stayed quiet even though they knew what was going on with Clinton’s non-state.gov email apparatus. “It’s a fundamental issue of government transparency,” I said. “We depend on the good faith of government when we file a Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) request. We rely on civil servants to do the job they’ve been entrusted to do. Hillary Clinton tore that compact up. If Mrs. Clinton gets away with it, if there’s no institutional accountability for her conduct, FOIA may end because you can’t rely on the law being enforced.”

This, as you can see, is no longer just about Bill and Hillary Clinton. It’s about the federal government generally, the FBI, the Department of Justice, the rule of law, national security, transparency and trust in government.  Again, the full video of the blockbuster educational panel is available here. "
100268,1002,"Donald Trump Fires Up Crowd of 10,000 in Colorado as Campaign’s Energy Lies in ‘The Movement’",http://www.breitbart.com/2016-presidential-race/2016/10/03/donald-trump-fires-crowd-10000-colorado-campaigns-energy-lies-movement/,11,"LOVELAND, Colorado — Donald J. Trump, the Republican nominee for President, rallied thousands—about 7,200 inside, according to the Trump campaign, and at least two thousand more outside—here while lambasting the media for refusing to report on the crowds.
“Hey, would you do me a favor fellas, span the room,” Trump said, speaking directly to the media. “Span the room, it’s pretty amazing. The place is packed. New record, place is packed.”

Turning back to the audience, Trump noted that his media corps that follows him around never show the crowds. “They never show our crowds, never. Maybe I’ll just wade into the crowd, maybe that way they will. They never, and in fact, tonight when you go home — cause I just looked behind — the smallest section is right behind me  because we have the flag and the flag of Colorado. So all you see is my face and the few people but they’re going to become movie stars — very attractive people.”

The reason why they don’t show the crowds, he said, is because it would show the whole country the size, scope, and diversity of the movement that is backing him for president. Trump went on:

You’re not going to see this because they never show it because it’s bad to show it, because if they show it they’re going to see what’s happening. They don’t see that this is going all the way up to the rafters and we love our flag, but I think I’m going to move it a little bit in this direction next time because they’re going to show — how many rows? Nice crowd, nice, but you understand what I’m saying. Oh, my people don’t get it, my people don’t, they don’t get it my people, but if they would span the crowd — and this is what we have, no matter where we go, it’s only dictated by the size of the arena — right by the size. We went to Pueblo today; we had a tremendous crowd. All dictated by the size of the arena, and I want to thank our fire marshal who was fantastic, he was fantastic to allow so many people into the building. They have people standing at every door, but I always say how can you have a fire, it’s a concrete floor? But I want to thank the fire marshals, they were fantastic and I want to thank our police, what a job they do. What a job. What a job.

Since the rest of the media refuses to show these crowds, Breitbart News — which was on site — took a variety of photographs of the crowd, both inside and outside."

USA TODAY reports that a man called Jeremy Peter Green bought the domain for $7.30 in 2011 but recently sold the domain to the Trump campaign for $15,000. The bottom of the page now reads: “Paid for by Donald J. Trump For President, Inc.” with a link to the official Trump campaign website.

Green revealed that although he plans on voting for Clinton, he is “very happy to have Trump’s money,” adding that the Clinton campaign told him they could not afford it.

“I bought it because I knew that if Clinton-Kaine ended up being the 2016 ticket, I would be able to use the web traffic have some fun with domain, and eventually sell it. I sold the domain because I wanted money,” he said.

“”Clinton’s campaign said they couldn’t afford anywhere near that though, claiming not to have a discretionary budget for this sort of thing, and offered me $2,000,” he continued.

The page now provides links to all the negative press surrounding Clinton, with the lead story being: “Clinton: Sanders Supporters Live In Parents Basement.”

Other stories on the site include stories from Trump’s website on Clinton’s damaging trade agenda, criticisms of her running mate Tim Kaine, and references to Hillary Clinton’s lies about her emails.

Donald Trump also posted a link to the site on his official Facebook account on Monday:"
100270,1003,Solidarity Against Trump,http://www.huffingtonpost.com/leo-w-gerard/solidarity-against-trump_b_12296680.html?utm_hp_ref=politics,11,"Donald Trump likes to say he has a very, very good relationship with unions.  “I have great relationships with unions,” he told Newsweek last year.

And the press is in love with saying blue-collar workers are in love with Trump. Real reporters and even fake news shows like Full Frontal with Samantha Bee have crisscrossed the rust belt interviewing blue-collar workers seeking the reason for Trump’s supposed allure.

The AFL-CIO has found, however, that only a small faction, fewer than a third, of its members are Trump supporters. That’s true in my union, the United Steelworkers (USW), as well. And the numbers are declining daily as members find out the truth about The Donald, including how he managed to lose a whopping $916 million in one year and his failure to pay federal income taxes.

Particularly important to my members is the issue of trade because we are a manufacturing union, with members making not just steel, but tires, glass, paper, cardboard, aluminum, auto parts and many other products. When Trump promises to arbitrarily slap 25 percent and 35 percent tariffs on unfairly traded commodities from China and Mexico, that sounds great.

That is, until the voter discovers a U.S. president can’t unilaterally impose tariffs. Also, until the voter discovers Trump manufactures virtually all his signature products, from suits to shirts, sweaters, belts, ties, tie pins, tie clips, and dozens of others, overseas. Not by American workers in America. Trump could have created American jobs. But he chose not to.

Here is what some members of my union had to say about the difference between The Don and Hillary Clinton:

Michael D. Snyder, 58 of Decatur, Ind., works for Bunge, which makes food oils. A union man for 39 years, he’s been president of USW Local 15173 for 21 years. “You need to look at the whole package and history of a candidate for president. Look at the whole package of Trump. I see someone who has done nothing but take from people in this country. There is a huge list of people who are suing him for taking from them, and that is disrespecting the American people. 

“It is a power game. He has got all the money. He knows he can do all these terrible things. He knows he may have to pay, but not until he is forced to by court. And people have to wait years to get some portion of the money owed. That is just terrible and disrespecting every American. That kind of person should not be president. It is inconceivable to put that person in charge of this country.

“In our churches, we would pray for this person because they are totally lost. It is hard to understand how a Christian would say OK to this kind of behavior.”

Marlon S. Williamson, 45, of Warren, Ohio, works at ATEP Alcoa. He has been a Steelworker for 20 years. I got a job at what was once Republic Steel in Warren, Ohio, when I was 23 years old. It was a great union job. But, beginning in 2008, I was laid off for 17 months because of dumped [foreign] steel. Those were hard times. I returned to work, but then, just a few years later, in 2012, management informed us the mill would be scrapped. I was stunned. I was shocked. It was because of a mix of bad management and dumped steel.

“I can’t even drive down that street now. I had worked there 17 years. At the time you are searching for answers. Imports contributed to that, with all that illegal dumping of steel.

“A lot of prayers got me the job at the titanium plant. I was very fortunate. I was off for four months. Some of the guys I used to work with are still out of work.

It is devastating.

“I support Hillary Clinton because she supports the working man and woman. She says exactly how she is going to do that. If we get her in office, maybe someone will pass that Bring Jobs Home Act, that denies tax credits for sending jobs overseas and gives credits for bringing jobs back here.

“Also, I have a daughter. My youngest child is a daughter. I do not want her to see Donald Trump as our country’s leadership. He mocks a guy with a handicap. He degrades women. He picks on immigrants. That is totally the opposite of what her mother and I have taught her.”

Kristia O’Brien, 45, is a veteran who lives in Gadsden, Ala. She has been a member of USW Local 12 for 22 years. She is a tire builder at Goodyear in Gadsden. My mother lost her garment factory job that she had for 20 years as a result of NAFTA, and I almost lost my job because of trade. So Hillary Clinton’s opposition to the Trans-Pacific Partnership, and her statement that she would not support any more free trade deals that don’t work for working people is really important to me.

“My mom worked for H.D. Lee, the jeans company, in Guntersville, Ala. She sewed the inseams. She has rheumatoid arthritis now, but she made a good living because it was a union job. But she lost that job when the plant went to Mexico. And another garment factory about 15 miles away went to Mexico too a few years after NAFTA was passed.

“Later, my plant was threatened by a flood of imported Chinese tires. President Obama imposed three years of tariffs on those unfairly traded tries to prevent American factories from closing and American jobs from being lost. I have a job today because of that. I do trust Hillary to do the same kind of thing. She has stood for working families and unions her entire life. Her father came out of manufacturing and she understands the importance of manufacturing in America.”

James Morgan, 30, of Belleville, Mich., works for Chemetall Group. He has been a member of USW Local 2659 for five years. I am working to elect Hillary Clinton for my unborn child, to make sure when he or she comes into the world, it is a better place, not a Donald Trump place. I want this to be a country that is accepting, a country that provides plenty of opportunity. Hopefully when he or she comes into this world, we have free college tuition and things like that. 

“I want this to be the land of the free where we accept everyone whether you are black, Asian, Mexican or Muslim. We have all contributed. And that is what made America what it is.  We can’t shun people.  It is not just an American value. Acceptance absolutely is a union value. If you have been to a union event, you see people from all walks of life, and they are people who accept people from all walks of life.

Heidi Puhl, 44, of South Range Wis., a member of USW Local 9460 for 10 years, works at Ecumen-Lakeshore, a short term rehab facility in Duluth, Minn. My father and grandfather worked on a railroad, the Duluth, Mesabi & Iron Range line. It hauled taconite pellets from the Mesabi Range to Lake Superior where they were shipped to steel mills. There was a railroad roundhouse in my hometown of Proctor, and in the harbor in the winter, typically dozen ships would arrive in winter to be overhauled.

“It’s all gone now. The railroad is shut down. Half the ships arrive to be overhauled these days. The town’s grocery store, pizza shop and ice cream parlor are all closed. And it’s because illegally traded steel flooded the U.S. market, shuttering American mills. And that eliminated the demand for taconite.

“Bad trade deals created pockets of nothing in our small towns. Hillary Clinton says she will put a stop to that. I believe she can. Donald Trump is all talk and no experience. I don’t believe he can do anything.

“I know people who support Trump. But is that how you want your daughter to be talked to? Is that how you want your son raised? Is that how you want your mother treated, your grandmother or grandfather treated? That is not our personal values. That is not the values of anybody in America. I do not think Trump has the right temperament or the right morals to be president. 

“I am working to elect Hillary Clinton because I do not want my kids to be raised in a place where it is okay to make fun of someone because of their disability or the color of their skin or their religion. 

“I like that Hillary worked for the Children’s Defense Fund. I like that she took a job that did not pay well to do public service. I think that says a lot about a person. I know someone who graduated with Hillary, and she says Hillary is the nicest and most sincere person. Hillary still goes to college reunions with her. That says a lot about her.”

Jerry August, 30, of San Bernardino, Calif., has been a member of USW Local 5632 for three years at GATX, where he rebuilds railcar valves to ensure they don’t leak and cause an explosion. My family is Hispanic. My grandparents came from Mexico. The way Donald Trump talks about undocumented immigrants is morally incorrect. It is not right. People should be given a chance to do what they can for themselves, to do better for themselves and their children and their future.

“To throw 11 million undocumented immigrants out of this country – why throw them out?  Why not get them documented and let them work? It is not morally right. They are not taking jobs. They are doing jobs no one else wants to do. The majority of people will not do the jobs they are doing. The jobs are there for everybody. These are hard labor jobs for pennies an hour.

“Trump harassed a judge of Mexican heritage whose father was a Steelworker. It is just ignorance. It is insulting. Ignorant people are just going to do ignorant things.”

“Coming from a Hispanic family, I still have family members who do not speak good English and who struggle to make good money, and I know Hillary Clinton will try to help us get to an even playing field. I feel that it is admirable that she has always tried to help the less fortunate.”

Terra Samuel, 43, of East Chicago, Ind., a member of USW Local 1010 for two years, works for ArcelorMittal.  I don’t see a future if Trump is elected. With Hillary, there is a track record. We know she can produce.

“The change would be devastating if Trump were to win. He is so angry and his followers are so angry. He would turn back the hands of time. I am not sure the country is ready for that.”

“I have two children. My 10-year-old daughter asked me, ‘If Trump is going to send Mexican people back to Mexico, where is he going to send black people?’ Donald Trump is scaring children!

“Hillary has credibility for working with labor unions and looking out for young people. I love her ideas for investing in infrastructure. Because she will require American-made products, that will support American manufacturing and create American jobs. That shows she is looking out for the future.”

Sam D’Orazio, 46, of Bentleyville, Pa., has been a member of USW Local 3403, Unit 25, for a decade. He works for All-Clad, a cookware manufacturer. Donald Trump says people earn too much. Does he include himself in that or just me?

“Donald Trump does not speak for me. He does not treat people fairly and equitably. I accept diversity and Trump rejects that.

“Donald Trump’s promises are false and not fulfillable.  He is an illusionist.

“Hillary Clinton will make sure people have a decent chance to get ahead. She opposes right to work and has a loyalty to labor. She doesn’t turn her back on people.” "
100271,1003,The Trump Supporter’s Week From Hell,http://www.huffingtonpost.com/andy-schmookler/the-trump-supporters-week_b_12312400.html?utm_hp_ref=politics,11,"For Donald Trump’s supporters, as the week of the first presidential debate began, things looked better than ever. Once Trump stopped going after a judge of Mexican descent and a Gold Star father, and started keeping such impulses under wraps, Trump had climbed steadily in the polls, pulling almost even with his Democratic opponent.

Then came the Monday evening debate — with all it revealed to nearly 100 million Americans — and all that transpired in the days afterwards.

For a Trump supporter, the week’s developments have not only diminished the likelihood of a Trump victory (according to all the evidence from polls and predictor markets). What’s worse, I would think, is how what the week’s revelations raise red flags about the desirability of his becoming president.

Consider:

In the wake of the debate, Trump insisted on waging a days-long fight with a former Miss Universe. Engaging in this fight was worse than getting sidetracked. It was positively injurious to his presumed purpose of getting elected. Which surely must raise the question:

Does it make sense to put into the hands of someone who picks his fights foolishly the power to choose decide for America between war and peace?

Trump’s major supporters had advised him — since his self-destructive rants in August — to avoid just this sort of conduct - advice that apparently was renewed as he went after this former beauty queen. But he ignored that advice.

Does it make sense to choose as the steward of America’s foreign affairs, and as commander-in-chief of our armed forces, a man unable or unwilling to follow wiser counsel to protect him from his own bad decisions?

Trump had surely seen how seriously he had injured his campaign, back in August, by continually pressing fights against people irrelevant to his task of persuading the American electorate to elect him president. But here he was, doing the same thing again.

How well-served will America likely be if the person at the helm — a rookie in the political world — is incapable of learning from his own mistakes?

During the debate, Trump’s opponent said that Trump “thinks that climate change is a hoax perpetrated by the Chinese,” to which Trump replied, “I did not. I do not say that.” Within minutes, the fact-checking universe brought forward Trump’s own tweet saying, “The concept of global warming was created by and for the Chinese in order to make U.S. manufacturing non-competitive.” Which should raise the question for all Americans,

If we can’t trust him to tell us the truth about something that is so easily verified, how well could we trust him as president to tell us the truth about situations that play out away from the public eye?

The evidence was overwhelming that Donald Trump was the loser in this first presidential debate. But in the course of the ensuing days, Trump himself seemed to deny that evident reality, insisting that he’d done just fine. Word came out, moreover, that he angrily forbade the people around him to concede that there had been any problem with his performance.

How safe would the nation be in the hands of someone who cannot recognize or admit his errors?

Much of the discussion of Trump’s disastrous debate performance centered around his lack of proper preparation for the event, in stark contrast to his well-prepared opponent. Various people privy to Trump’s debate prep process later spoke to reporters about what the process was like. It emerged that Trump was apparently unable to focus on the task, unable to approach the challenge in a disciplined way.

How well able would an unfocused, undisciplined mind be to deal with a complex, dangerous crisis that might arise on his watch?

For example, the 2000 film Thirteen Days portrays the most dangerous crisis thus far in human history: the 1962 Cuban Missile crisis in which the United States and the Soviet Union came closer than ever before or since to an all-out nuclear war. The film shows what disciplined and sustained strategic thinking, on the part of President Kennedy and his advisors, went into finding a successful resolution of that crisis. The well-being of all Americans (and indeed the whole world) depended on the American president having capabilities that members of Trump’s inner circle report that Trump lacks.

Is there anything in the political picture that any American can wisely say should outweigh these revelations from Trump’s week from hell?"
100272,1003,Fact Checkers Threaten To Boycott Next Presidential Debate Unless Trump Agrees To Use At Least One Fact,http://www.huffingtonpost.com/christopher-lamb/fact-checkers-threaten-to_b_12253166.html?utm_hp_ref=politics,11,"The leading fact-checking association in the United States has threatened to boycott the second presidential debate if GOP candidate Donald Trump doesn’t meet their demands.

The National Organization of Fact-Checking Technicians sent an email to the Trump Campaign and the Commission on Presidential Debates on Monday that said none of its members would attend the next debate unless the billionaire real estate developer agreed to use at least one fact.

“We cannot in good conscience be a part of the debate as long as Mr. Trump continues to make a mockery of facts and of people like us who are willing to put our reputations - and even our lives - on the line to protect and preserve the value of facts and everything they represent,” Faith Candor, president of NOFACT, wrote in the email.

“Is it too much, Mr. Trump,” she asked, “to ask you to include at least one actual fact in your next debate with Hillary Clinton?”

Trump and Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton will next debate each other at Washington University in St. Louis, Missouri, on Sunday, October 9.

Candor said that fact-checkers accept a certain amount of exaggeration, distortion, prevarication, and outright lying on the campaign trail. But, she added, that there is usually a “germ of truth” in most statements made by political candidates.

“With Trump, there is no truth to what he says. The only thing you get from him is germs,” she said. “He appears to simply pull everything he says out of his rear end.”

PolitiFact, the Pulitzer Prize-winning journalism website, supported Candor’s comment. It reported that only 2.5 percent of Trump’s statements during the presidential campaign were rated “true.” More than 60 percent of his statements were rated either “false” or were considered “pants on fire” lies, which is the category given to statements without any basis in truth.

PolitiFact said Trump has made more “pants on fire” statements during the presidential campaigns than all other 21 presidential candidates combined. It awarded Trump its 2015 “Lie of the Year.” It could not designate one particular lie so it gave Trump the award for his body of work.

Trump responded angrily to the email from NOFACT. He called the threat “politically motivated.”

“The facts have a well-known liberal bias,” Trump tweeted.

Trump responded to the fact checkers’ demand in a separate tweet a minute later:

“Fact checkers are for losers. My supporters don’t want facts.”

Candor said she was encouraged by Trump’s response.

“What he said about his supporters is actually a fact,” she said."
100273,1004,Appeals Court Knocks Pence's Anti-Refugee Policy As 'Discrimination',http://talkingpointsmemo.com/livewire/court-pence-syrian-refugees-discrimination,11,"A panel of three federal appeals court judges on Monday declined to block a preliminary injunction against Indiana Gov. Mike Pence, the Republican vice presidential nominee, to keep him from withholding funds from refugee resettlement agencies.

Judge Richard Posner of the 7th Circuit Court of Appeals wrote that Pence's action ""targeting Syrian refugees is discrimination on the basis of nationality.""

Posner, a well known and oft-cited judge, wrote the opinion for the panel including Judges Frank Easterbrook and Diane Sykes. He compared Pence's decision to single out Syrian refugees to racial discrimination against blacks.

“He argues that his policy of excluding Syrian refugees is based not on nationality and thus is not discriminatory, but is based solely on the threat he thinks they pose to the safety of residents of Indiana. But that’s equivalent of his saying (not that he does say) that he wants to forbid black people to settle in Indiana not because they’re black but because he’s afraid of them, and since race is therefore not his motive he isn’t discriminating,"" Posner wrote. ""But that of course would be racial discrimination, just as his targeting Syrian refugees is discrimination on the basis of nationality.""

Following the terrorist attacks in Paris last year, Pence directed state agencies to stop the resettlement of refugees from Syria, citing security concerns. The governor's directive prompted Exodus Refugee Immigration, Inc., to redirect a Syrian refugee family to Connecticut at the last minute and to later sue the governor to keep him from withholding funds from refugee resettlement agencies.

The federal district court had previously granted a preliminary injunction blocking Pence's move. The state of Indiana appealed that decision to the 7th Circuit, which issued its decision Monday.

Pence had said that he needed ""assurances that proper security measures are in place"" from the federal government before the state could accept Syrian refugees again.

In his opinion, Posner argued that Pence's fears about refugees from Syria were unfounded.

""[T]he brief provides no evidence that Syrian terrorists are posing as refugees or that Syrian refugees have ever committed acts of terrorism in the United States. Indeed, as far as can be determined from public sources, no Syrian refugees have been arrested or prosecuted for terrorist acts or attempts in the United States,"" he wrote."
100274,1004,NY AG Sends Trump Charity Cease And Desist Letter For Fundraising Violation,http://talkingpointsmemo.com/livewire/trump-foundation-cease-and-desist-letter,11,"The New York Attorney General's office sent the Donald Trump Foundation a cease and desist letter Friday pointing to its apparent solicitation of outside contributions without being properly registered to do so.

In a comment to NBC News, which first broke news of the letter, the Trump campaign cited what it alleged were the ""political motives"" of New York Attorney General Eric Schneiderman (D) in pursing the investigation, while adding that the charity plans to cooperate.

View image on Twitter
 The letter -- sent by James Sheehan, head of the attorney general’s charities bureau -- orders the Trump Foundation to stop ""soliciting contributions or engaging in any other fundraising activities in New York."" A Washington Post report published Thursday evening highlighted that the Trump Foundation had taken in outside money in recent years even though it had not taken the steps to register to do so, as is required by state law.

Tax returns from 2014 and earlier showed that the Trump Foundation had not been registered as a ""7-A"" charity, a certification that is required by New York state law for charities that solicit outside donations. Trump himself has not donated personally to the charity since 2008, according to its tax records, and the coffers of the private foundation have been filled by third party contributors. Thursday's report in the Washington Post surfaced a number of examples of when the Trump Foundation explicitly solicited outside donations, including at a veterans fundraising event the presidential candidate hosted as counter-programming to a GOP primary debate he boycotted.

The Attorney General's letter gives the Trump Foundation 15 days to provide the agency with the information about its fundraising activities required by state law, and to refile the appropriate forms.

""The failure immediately to discontinue solicitation and to file information and reports required under Article 7-A with the Charities Bureau shall be deemed to be a continuing fraud upon the people of the state of New York,"" the letter said.

The certification issue is just one of a number of concerns raised about the Trump Foundation's practices. The Washington Post also has reported on instances of self-dealing, in which the charity's money was used to the personal benefit of Trump. The transactions appeared to be a violation of both IRS code and state law.

Had the Trump Foundation been properly registered with New York to solicit contributions, it would have been subjected to an annual independent audit by an outside accountant. Such an audit may have caught the self-dealing and other alleged improper activities, charity law experts told the Washington Post.

100275,1004,Lewandowski Hopes Trump Sues NY Times ‘Into Oblivion’ For Tax Report,http://talkingpointsmemo.com/livewire/lewandowski-trump-sue-new-york-times-report-tax-returns,11,"Former Trump campaign manager Corey Lewandowski said Monday that the Republican nominee should sue The New York Times “into oblivion” for publishing a bombshell report suggesting that he may have avoided paying federal income taxes for 18 years.

During a panel on CNN’s “New Day,” Lewandowski let loose against the newspaper for publishing the first three pages of Trump’s 1995 tax return, which Times reporter Susanne Craig received from an anonymous source, without the candidate’s permission.

Noting that the Times’ executive editor Dean Baquet said last month that he would risk jail time to publish Trump’s tax returns, Lewandowski charged that the newspaper “decided to publish it without any authentication.”

“They went to the accountant who prepared them,” CNN host Dana Bash replied.

“But he's also not authorized to release those,” Lewandowski insisted.

Bash explained that the public was interested in the contents of Trump’s tax returns and his refusal to release them, in a break from 40 years of historical precedent, forced the media to take these steps.

“There is no national security interest to Donald Trump's taxes,” Lewandowski said. “The New York Times should be held accountable and I hope he sues them into oblivion for doing this. Because the fact remains that if it comes out that these are not accurate, where’s the recourse?”

CNN commentator received a severance from the Trump campaign until last week, continues to serve as an informal advisor to the real estate mogul, and is bound by a non-disclosure agreement that prevents him from disparaging his former boss.

The Times verified the authenticity of Trump's tax documents with Jack Mitnick, the accountant who prepared them. The newspaper also confirmed the legality of publishing them with their own team of lawyers.

Though Trump’s lawyer Marc Kasowitz threatened “appropriate legal action” against the newspaper for publishing the returns, 10 prominent attorneys surveyed by legal blog Concurring Opinions said that the First Amendment protected the newspaper in publishing truthful, newsworthy information about a major public figure."

In an opinion issued on Monday, the 7th Circuit Court of Appeals slammed Pence's treatment of Syrian refugees, saying his effort to block their resettlement was based on ""no evidence"" and constituted ""nightmare speculation."" The final decision for the three-member panel was written by Judge Richard Posner, who was appointed by Ronald Reagan. Also on the bench was Judge Diane Sykes, who was appointed by George W. Bush and was recently named by Trump's campaign as a potential Supreme Court nominee.

After the Paris terror attacks last November, Pence was one of 31 governors who opposed the resettlement of Syrian refugees in their respective states. In Indiana, Pence declared that state agencies would no longer cover the cost of some key social services for any refugees whose country of origin was listed as Syria on their refugee documents.

""Indiana has a long tradition of opening our arms and homes to refugees from around the world but, as governor, my first responsibility is to ensure the safety and security of all [Indiana residents],"" Pence said at the time.

A resettlement agency called Exodus Refugee Immigration sued the state, saying its refusal to help resettle Syrian refugees constituted discrimination based on national origin. According to the court document, 174 Syrian refugees were settled in Indiana in the last fiscal year.

In March, a federal judge blocked Pence's order, saying his withholding of state resources ""clearly discriminates against Syrian refugees based on their national origin."" The case was appealed and brought before a panel of three Republican-appointed judges who upheld the injunction.

In his decision, Judge Posner pointed out there have been no known cases of Syrian refugees being arrested or prosecuted for terrorist acts in the United States. In response to Pence's argument that his policy is not based on national origin discrimination but rather on national security concerns, Posner wrote, ""That's the equivalent of his saying (not that he does say) that he wants to forbid black people to settle in Indiana not because they're black but because he's afraid of them, and since race is therefore not his motive he isn't discriminating. But that, of course, would be racial discrimination, just as his targeting Syrian refugees is discrimination on the basis of nationality.""

Attempts to suspend Syrian refugee resettlement in individual states has not fared well so far. Texas and Alabama both filed lawsuits against the federal government over the placement of Syrian refugees in those states. Both cases were dismissed in federal court and have since been appealed.

Since becoming Trump's vice presidential pick, Pence has been a supporter of Trump's proposal to stop accepting Syrian refugees into the country. He told NBC's Meet the Press that the resettlement program ""puts safety and security of the American people second to the agenda of the UN or to liberals in this country.""

One of the judges who oversaw the case was Diane Sykes, who is known for writing a decision restricting women's access to birth control and defending the right of a Christian student group to exclude LGBT people. She is also a potential Supreme Court pick for Donald Trump.

100277,1005,Remember When Trump Said He Was Audited Because He Was a Christian?,http://www.motherjones.com/politics/2016/10/remember-when-trump-said-he-was-audited-because-he-was-christian,11,"Many people say that Donald Trump speaks with no regard for accuracy or consequences. With the recent news that Trump declared a $916 million loss on his 1995 tax returns and possibly exploited a loophole to not pay federal income taxes for 18 years, one of those instances of Trump mouthing off deserves to be reexamined.

During a GOP primary debate in February, Trump claimed that he was not releasing his tax returns because he was being audited by the IRS. Immediately after the slugfest, CNN's Chris Cuomo asked the reality television star on air about this, and Trump replied:

The one problem I have is that I'm always audited by the IRS, which I think is very unfair. I don't know, maybe because of religion, maybe because of something else, maybe because I'm doing this, although this is just recently.

Religion? Trump was being audited because of his religion? Really? Cuomo asked for an explanation: ""What do you mean religion?"" Trump went on:

Well, maybe because of the fact that I'm a strong Christian, and I feel strongly about it and maybe there's a bias.

An incredulous Cuomo pressed the matter: ""You think you can get audited for being a strong Christian?"" And Trump responded, ""Well, you see what's happened. You have many religious groups that are complaining about that. They've been complaining about it for a long time.""

This was some allegation. No major presidential candidate had ever charged that he was being targeted by a federal agency because of his religious beliefs.

Later that evening, CNN's Anderson Cooper pushed Trump on this, asking if he truly thought the IRS was after him because of his Christian beliefs. Trump appeared to backpedal a bit, answering: ""Well, I know they certainly had a lot of problems, I mean, if you look at what's been happening over the years. I don't think, I don't think it applies."" He still insisted he had been unfairly targeted for the audit: ""But I can tell you one thing: I am audited when I shouldn't be audited…Why is it that every single year, I'm audited, whereas other people that are very rich, people are never audited.""

Now the public knows this was merely fact-free posturing. According to the New York Times report—the accuracy of which has not been challenged by Trump or his campaign—the real estate mogul took nearly a $1 billion loss in a move that could have erased his federal income tax obligation for almost the next two decades. So when Trump was playing the Christian card and accusing the IRS of religious bias (without providing a crumb of evidence), he certainly knew that the IRS had plenty of legitimate reasons for giving his tax returns a damn careful review. And even when he backed off this claim, he still moaned that he had been unfairly selected for an audit. Yet due to his billion-dollar scheme, of all American taxpayers (or non-taxpayers), Trump perhaps most deserved auditing.

Trump's statements from February now look absolutely ridiculous—and they are further indication that Trump cannot be trusted to speak truthfully about his taxes and finances.

Watch Trump claim the IRS was after him because of his religious views:"

100279,1006,NYT editor: “We do not know the identity of the source” of the Trump tax returns,http://hotair.com/archives/2016/10/03/nyt-editor-not-know-identity-source-trump-tax-returns/,11,"I want to flag this because yesterday the actual reporter on the story, Susanne Craig, gave a pointed no-comment to CNN when asked if the paper knows who sent them Trump’s returns. Interestingly, one of the paper’s executive editors wasn’t as coy:

That doesn’t appear to be the case in the Times’ story, which carried the bylines of four reporters, including Craig and David Barstow, an investigative reporter who has won three Pulitzer Prizes.

While Craig declined to discuss her understanding of who sent the Trump documents, Times deputy executive editor Matt Purdy was definitive: “We do not know the identity of the source.”
I don’t know why they’d be on different pages on revealing whether they know the identity of the source or not. It could be that Purdy, as an editor, is thinking harder about litigation possibilities than Craig is. If the Times plays coy about the source, it might encourage Trump to file a lawsuit with an eye to forcing the paper, on pain of contempt, to give up the source for illegally disclosing confidential tax information. Purdy’s telling Trump here not to bother trying to squeeze them because they legitimately don’t know who it is.

Which raises the question: Whodunnit? The media’s pet theory is that it’s Trump’s ex-wife, Marla Maples, taking high-stakes revenge nearly 20 years after their marriage dissolved. The press craves a twist like that because it would bring Trump’s tabloid roots full circle. But there’s no hard evidence against Maples apart from the fact that the return comes from a year (1995) during which she and Trump were married and bears her signature. Any lawyer or accountant who worked on Trump’s finances during that period might have the same documents. It is true that, during their divorce in 1999, Maples allegedly said that she’d reveal what she knows about him and sink his presidential ambitions if he ended up running as the Reform Party nominee (Trump allegedly withheld alimony in retaliation), but when asked about the quote recently, Maples denied ever saying it. On the contrary, she went to Cleveland this summer with Tiffany, her daughter with Trump, when Tiffany spoke at the GOP convention and told the Daily Beast later, “My daughter is back here wanting to get to know her dad and spend more time with him, and I have to really respect that and I do respect that in every way.” Blowing up dad’s presidential chances by leaking documents, knowing she’d be a prime suspect, isn’t going to heal the rift between father and daughter. As it is, reporters have been left trying to decode Maples’s tweets for clues that she’s behind the big story this weekend. That’s how thin the evidence is.

The best case for Maples as the leaker is this post by Yashar Ali, but that’s not to say it’s necessarily a good case. Ali notes that the Times’s copy of Trump’s return includes the image of a little “sign here” sticker pointing to Maples’s signature, suggesting that it might be her own personal copy. Eh — all it might mean is that Maples signed after Trump did and that the photocopies distributed to lawyers, accountants, etc, were made with the sticker still attached to the signature page. Ali also points out that Maples is uniquely positioned to leak these returns because they’re her returns too. She’s legally entitled to publish them; Trump’s lawyers and accountants are not. In that case, though, why did Maples surreptitiously mail the returns to the Times instead of phoning an editor and saying, “Come get what I’ve got, but keep my name out of it”? The only reason to keep her identity unknown even to the Times is if she has a nondisclosure agreement with Trump that extends to their tax filings, in which case she could be in legal trouble for violating the agreement. But Ali talked to legal experts who say they’ve never heard of an NDA extending to taxes. I wouldn’t underestimate the famously secretive Trump on that, but if Ali’s right then there’s no reason for Maples to hide her provenance from the Times, only from the public. (Although the Times itself might be glad not to know the provenance due to the contempt implications I described up top.)

Ali does make one good point, though:

Despite the fact that the Trump campaign said that the Times is “an extension of the Clinton campaign”, they’re not (after all they broke the email server story in March of 2015). The Times had these returns for ten days and took their reporting on these returns seriously_—_even going so far as hiring tax experts to analyze the returns. They sought a comment from the Trump campaign, they spoke to the accountant who prepared and signed the returns.

So it would be highly unusual for them to not contact Ms. Maples about the tax returns given that her name is on all of the returns and her signature is on the New Jersey return. Yet the Times, in their story, does not indicate that they contacted Ms. Maples. Even if she didn’t return their calls or emails, they would still indicate that they reached out to her and had not heard back.
That is odd. Why wouldn’t you contact the other person on a joint return if you’re trying to confirm its authenticity? They went to Florida to interview Trump’s elderly retired accountant but they wouldn’t dial up his ex-wife to ask if the numbers on the document they have are right? There’s no obvious reason to avoid asking Maples for a comment unless she’s the source and the Times knows it. If, on the other hand, the editor is telling the truth when he says they don’t know who the source is then there really is no obvious reason for the paper to have avoided contacting Maples.

As for whether Trump might sue the Times, as some of his advisors are suggesting, Erick Erickson notes that there’s probably a reason why only pages from state returns were sent to the Times. That’s the leaker’s attempt to sidestep federal law prohibiting the release of federal documents. There’s a better reason why Trump will think twice about suing, though — namely, discovery. What happens when the Times is dragged into court and starts demanding copies of his financial documents, including but not limited to tax returns, to defend the suit? Suing could turn into an epic own-goal, which is probably why the paper felt comfortable going forward with the story. Even if there’s a chance they could be sued, they may get more out of it than they lose.

By the way, while Maples doesn’t tweet regularly, she did tweet yesterday and said nothing about the Times story despite all the speculation about her role in it. If and when she publicly denies being the source, I’ll update. Exit question: How is the big scoop about Trump’s $900 million loss a scoop when Trump himself broke the story years ago?"

In isolation, the idea that PTSD is a form of weakness to which the “strong” are immune is egregious and malignant insofar as it might discourage vets who need it from seeking treatment. But context is everything. This isn’t Patton slapping soldiers for suffering from combat trauma. Trump is sympathetic to them: He’s in trouble here for his poor choice of a single word — “strong” — but clearly he’s not trying to denigrate soldiers with PTSD. (He saves his contempt for soldiers who are captured in battle.) I think in his own Trump-y way he’s making the prosaic point that different people have different natural thresholds for how much war-related trauma they’re able to endure. He reached for the word “strong” to describe those with higher thresholds because he’s Trump and “strength” is his go-to word for “health,” “resilience,” and so forth. I don’t see any intent to stigmatize treatment for combat-related trauma here. On the contrary, he spends most of his answer on how treatment is more urgently needed. I realize the media is kitchen-sinking him now that it’s October, but if you want to kill him for casually smearing troops, you’ve always got the McCain/POW comments from last year.

Update: The veteran who asked Trump the question at today’s town hall also thinks his answer is perfectly fine. "
100281,1006,"Polls: Trump trails narrowly in North Carolina, Pennsylvania, and Florida — and badly in Colorado",http://hotair.com/archives/2016/10/03/polls-trump-trails-narrowly-north-carolina-pennsylvania-florida-badly-colorado/,11,"The good news in the battleground states per Quinnipiac is that he now leads by five in Ohio and hasn’t suffered any real damage in North Carolina and Pennsylvania despite the fact that voters in every state had Clinton winning the debate handily. In fact, check the last six polls of Pennsylvania and you’ll find that that state is now highly competitive in the four-way race, with Clinton’s lead ranging from four points in today’s Qunnipiac survey to just one point in multiple other recent polls. The most tantalizing prize for Republicans in the electoral college is within reach for Trump thanks to his strength with the white working class. If he can put together the trifecta of Pennsylvania, Ohio, and Florida, he’ll have a very real shot at 270.

But what if, for once, Pennsylvania actually isn’t the most elusive of those three states?

Florida: Clinton leads Trump 46 – 41 percent, with 5 percent for Johnson and 2 percent for Stein;

North Carolina: Clinton at 46 percent to Trump’s 43 percent, with 7 percent for Johnson. Clinton had 42 percent to Trump’s 38 percent September 8;

Ohio: Trump tops Clinton 47 – 42 percent, with 6 percent for Johnson and 1 percent for Stein;

Pennsylvania: Clinton at 45 percent to Trump’s 41 percent, with 5 percent for Johnson and 2 percent for Stein. Clinton was up 44 – 39 percent September 8.
Three of those states look similar to how they looked a month ago. Florida doesn’t. Clinton’s lead of five points isn’t huge, but five points would be larger than Obama’s winning margin in the state in 2008 and 2012. It’s a biggish lead by Florida’s standards, and Quinnipiac’s not the only pollster lately to see Clinton with that sort of cushion. Monmouth actually had her up five a week before the debate; a few days ago, Mason-Dixon had her up four. Now this. It should go without saying at this point that Trump’s Pennsylvania dream matters if and only if he also locks down Ohio and Florida too. In fact, Harry Enten looked at hypothetical electoral maps in which Clinton wins Florida and found that there are a multitude of ways she could go on to win the presidency from that point even if Trump strongly overperforms expectations everywhere else. For instance:

Let’s say, for example, that on Election Day, Clinton underperforms with white voters without college degrees even more so than she is doing now. Her support would collapse in the Midwest, and her troubles in Maine would likely bleed over into New Hampshire. But Florida is more diverse, with one of the largest groups of Latino voters of any battleground state and a sizable African-American population. So, in this scenario, the nonwhite vote in Florida might allow Clinton to hold onto the state even if she were to lose Michigan, New Hampshire, Ohio and Wisconsin…

Indeed, winning Florida opens up so many electoral paths for Clinton that it’s probably a must-win for Trump. If he loses Florida, Trump wins the presidency only 5 percent of the time according to our polls-only forecast. (Clinton, on the other hand, wins the election 33 percent of the time without a victory in Florida.) Considering that Clinton has led in every post-debate survey in Florida and has a small lead there in our polls-only forecast, you can understand why Clinton is currently a favorite to win the election.
Clinton could face a total apocalypse among the white working class of the Rust Belt and still squeak through to a national victory thanks to more racially diverse battlegrounds like Virginia, (eastern) Pennsylvania, and of course Florida. Quinnipiac finds Trump winning in Florida among whites without a college degree by 34 points(!) and even among whites who do have a degree by six points. He still loses by five, though, thanks to Clinton’s huge advantage with nonwhite voters (and her 20-point advantage among women of all races). See now why Team Hillary is talking up that Trump/Cuba story that most of us are shrugging at? Cuban-Americans in Florida might not shrug at it. If that tips Florida to Clinton, that’s ballgame nationally.

Forget Florida for a second, though. What the hell happened here in Colorado? New from Monmouth:

Among Colorado voters likely to participate in November’s presidential election, 49% currently support Clinton and 38% back Trump. Another 7% intend to vote for Libertarian Gary Johnson, 3% support Green Party candidate Jill Stein, and 3% are undecided. In mid-July, the race stood at Clinton 48%, Trump 35%, Johnson 5%, and Stein 3%…

Colorado voters continue to hold a more negative view of Trump than Clinton. Fewer than 4-in-10 (37%) have a favorable opinion of Clinton while 51% hold an unfavorable view of her. However, only 29% have a favorable opinion of Trump while 63% hold an unfavorable view of him. Both of these results have changed little since July…

Clinton has an even wider advantage on the issue of presidential temperament – something that has been dominating the news since last week’s debate. Twice as many voters say Clinton has the right temperament for the job (61%) compared to those who say the same about Trump (31%).
Monmouth sees Hillary winning by 13 among women in Colorado and by seven among … men, which seems unlikely. Also unlikely is the margin: The last four pre-debate polls of Colorado had the race Clinton by one, Clinton by two, Trump by four, Trump by one. Suddenly, the first post-debate poll has her up eleven? That’s some bounce. Also of note: The last Monmouth poll of Colorado, conducted in July, had Clinton up 13 points, her biggest lead there all year. It may be that Monmouth’s model of the Colorado electorate has an unusually large outlier-ish advantage for Clinton built in. Trump had better hope so, as the tight race in Colorado the past few weeks was his brightest hope of peeling off a key blue state from Hillary in November.

There is, however, a reason to think Monmouth’s onto something in seeing a large Clinton lead in the state now. For one thing, Democrats now have a slight registration advantage in there, an ominous trend given the traditional red tilt in Colorado. Beyond that, it’s always been a long reach for Trump demographically. There are enough Latinos there and libertarian-leaning Republicans there that it’s hard to see how he’d piece together a winning coalition. His best chance would be if Gary Johnson carved a chunk out of Clinton’s support, especially among millennials — but the noteworthy thing about Monmouth’s polls of the state, both today and in July, is how poorly they have Johnson doing compared to everyone else. Most other pollsters have him in the 12-13 point range. Monmouth has him at seven points today and had him at just five this summer. Clearly some of Hillary’s larger lead in their surveys is due to the third-party guy underperforming. If voters are beginning to desert Johnson in the home stretch of the race — and there’s reason to think they are, per Quinnipiac’s data — then Colorado might be off the board after all. Trump would need the PA/OH/FL trifecta, no ifs, ands, or buts. We’ll see what the next polls there say."

Doesn’t even remotely add up.

Back in 1995, the New York Times was singing a different tune about Trump.


In fact, they praised him for his various business wheelings and dealings.

From The Daily Caller: The New York Times lashed out hard at Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump over the weekend with a report claiming his 1995 tax returns suggest he may have used a massive loss that year to avoid paying income taxes for the next 18 years. But back in 1995, the paper was crowning Trump as “the Comeback King” for overcoming massive debt to save his business.

The article focused on the revival of Trump’s business fortunes after a series of missteps in the early 1990s, the same missteps it profiled in its article over the weekend.


“Though there are still four years to go in the 90’s, business and government leaders in New York honored Donald J. Trump yesterday for pulling off what they called ‘the comeback of the decade,’” the paper said at the time. “Mr. Trump, the developer who came to epitomize opulent wealth during the 80’s before tumbling into deep financial trouble, has managed to erase much of his debt and is moving ahead with major projects at a time other developers are idling.”

Well that’s weird!

Apparently, he has strong support in Amish country as well. From Conservative Tribune:

Given Donald Trump’s mastery of social media, it’s interesting that one of his most die-hard group of fans, literate as they are, couldn’t even read his tweets if they wanted to.

When Donald Trump came to the swing state of Pennsylvania, he also stopped by Lancaster County, best known to those outside the region as “Amish country.” The Amish decided to take a break from working the fields and decided to work at making America great again.

There were plenty of beards and hats to be seen, and while there weren’t a whole lot of buttons keeping the garments fastened, there were certainly a lot of Trump/Pence buttons to be seen.

Winning Pennsylvania would be huge for Trump.

It will be interesting to see if his support in rural areas is enough to overcome the liberal strongholds in places like Philadelphia.

“[Comey] added an element to the offense that doesn’t exist,” Gowdy told Bartiromo. “So I disagree with his analysis of the statute, but even if he’s right, he’s still wrong with the conclusion that he reached.”

Here’s the video. Trey nailed it again.

Nice to know that at least one person in Washington is fed up with the nonsense the Justice Department has been feeding us on this issue.

100285,1008,It Finally Happened: Politics Has Ruined Everything Fun,http://www.americanthinker.com/articles/2016/09/it_finally_happened_politics_has_ruined_everything_fun.html,11,"Not that long ago, I could get away from the dystopian news environment and relax.  I'd spend my weekends at the movies, chatting with friends over a latte or watching football on my oversized 4K TV, all things that bring a smile, take me away – just good old-fashioned fun.  But one after another, these treasured pastimes have become something else – a reminder of the dark times we live in, another forum for angry political discourse.  In their zeal to control every aspect of our lives, liberal activists have left no stone unturned. 

My first casualty was the movies.  Nothing saves you from reality more than a good flick.  But  one by one, my favorite Hollywood stars publicly inserted themselves into politics.  Mark Ruffalo, Jennifer Lawrence, Matt Damon, and Ben Affleck are on the growing list of actors and actresses who feel compelled to take stands on issues that have nothing to do with their films. 

Now, I'd like to be the bigger person and not let personal politics affect my entertainment choices, but the fact is, their foray into politics changes my perception.  Now, instead of seeing these actors and actresses as the characters they so brilliantly portray, I see the man behind the curtain, the flawed person behind the illusion.  Gone are the days when I can separate the activist actor from his performance.  Now their reality is in my face.   

Same with authors.  I've faithfully followed Stephen King and J.K. Rowling throughout their writing careers.  But these successful authors weren't content with fame and fortune; they craved influence in the political arena.  So as in Hollywood, they chose to share their political views with their readers, to yank us out of their superbly written fiction and back to the real world.

Fortunately, my cappuccino addiction allowed me to ignore Starbucks's political correctness for quite a while.  Even though Starbucks tweeted rainbows over gay marriage and had their baristas chat up customers on left-wing subjects (though that didn't last long), it was background noise, not enough to separate me from my espresso.  But when the Starbucks CEO publicly endorsed Hillary Clinton, when the media made that endorsement breaking news, I got the message.  As a result, I'm no longer lulled into euphoria by Starbucks's artsy ambience or caffeine; now I'm burdened by the same oppressive feelings I get when I watch the news or read a paper.  Dark, sad, depressing.

Of course, I should be grateful that the CEO killed the buzz – it's going to save me over $1,000 a year.  Yet it's like losing a good friend.  A sad day.

I can't even shop in peace these days.  Target was my all-time favorite store – bright, well-lit, with fun displays and great products.  But Target couldn't allow that cheerful joviality in their stores.  Nope – they had to step in and take a stand against 99.7% of their customer base.  They proudly issued a policy that anyone – man, woman, pervert, pedophile – can use the bathroom of his choice.  The result: I don't shop at Target anymore, because the stigma of politics has infected the store and because I'm hesitant to use the bathroom. 

But I still had football, right?  Wrong.  Before we could kick off the season, a fading star named Colin Kaepernick had some kind of epiphany that he could change the world by sitting out the National Anthem.  The right vs. left media made Colin's sit-out national headlines for weeks – he has the right, 1st Amendment vs. he's an ungrateful millionaire spitting on the country that made him great, and on and on.  But they miss the point: I don't care.  Whatever these sports icons think, I really and truly don't care.  Just play ball.

Once the media gets its hooks in a contentious story, there's no going back.  So I'm treated to more political posturing from those who joined Colin's sit-out or knee-out or whatever.  As with Starbucks, I did my best to move past Colin and enjoy the game, but the political spin soon engulfed football until I had to turn away yet again.

So here I am.  No more cappuccinos, very few movies, limited reading, Walmart instead of Target, and now no football.  What's left?  Well, not one to give up, I'm planning a trip to Disney World.  Of course, Disney still has time to ruin my magical plans with political crap, so I have to admit I'm nervous.

Will Mickey Mouse boycott his own Mickey's Very Merry Christmas Party to make a statement for PETA on rodent rights?  I mean, the trap thing is pretty barbaric. 

My worst nightmare is that Cinderella, Belle, Elsa, and other princesses could show up in pantsuits, no makeup or jewelry, and unwashed, limp hair, to show that princesses don't have to be dressed in elegant, sparkling gowns or be ethereal to play the part. 

I pray that none of these scenarios will materialize.  I'm looking forward to this trip and would hate to cancel.  No, I wouldn't cancel because I disagree with their politics; I haven't got what it takes to sacrifice something I love to make a statement.  I'd cancel because politics again dumped on my fantasy world and sucked the joy out of my trip.  I'd cancel because the dark, hateful world of news and politics is stalking me, targeting and infecting every enjoyable part of my life.  My only defense is to give up those indulgences and move on.  When it stops being fun, I stop doing it. 

Elvis Presley summed it up perfectly when filming the musical Roustabout.  The director, John Rich, wasn't particularly impressed with Elvis's entourage hanging around and playing practical jokes on one another.  When Rich approached Elvis about his traveling companions clowning around and disrupting, Elvis didn't back down from his director.  He told Rich,  ""When these damn movies cease to be fun, I'll stop doing them.""

Cheers, Elvis.  Couldn't have said it better myself.

100286,1008,The Prospects of a Constitutional Convention,http://www.americanthinker.com/articles/2016/10/the_prospects_of_a_constitutional_convention.html,11,"Regardless of the outcome of the 2016 presidential election, our republic needs a powerful redress against the unconstitutional usurpation of power by the federal government and particularly by the Supreme Court and the president.  Restoring federalism is the answer to every significant problem in our republic because federalism produces the marketplace of governments that reward states with honest, efficient, and unobtrusive and which drives wealth and voters out of leftist nanny states.

While Republicans at the federal level ought to embrace and to push this agenda, the narcotic of federal government power and printing presses makes it hard for any national party in Washington to actually fight Washington.  The best answer is to enact constitutional amendments that structurally change the balance of power between state governments and the federal government.

State legislatures on their own have the power to make these changes because, although no amendment can be enacted without the consent of three quarters of the state legislatures, these very state legislatures can, on their own, both propose and ratify constitutional amendments.

Convening a constitutional convention would require 34 state legislatures, or two thirds of the states.  Republicans in state legislatures, if they wished to convene such a convention, would be close to that right now.  Thirty-one state legislatures have both chambers controlled by Republicans (I count Nebraska in that total), or three short of the needed 34 state legislatures.

The 2018 midterm elections could change all that, especially if it is the sort of Republican victory that took place in 2014 and 2010.  Seven states – Colorado, Iowa, Kentucky, Maine, Minnesota, New Mexico, and Washington – have Republicans in control of one chamber and close to control in the opposite chamber.

If Republicans gained the opposite chamber in four of those states, then a convention could be called, and if Republicans gained the opposite chamber in all seven states, then Republicans at the state legislative level could not only convene, but ratify constitutional amendments.  How unlikely is that?  Well, consider just how few seats changes in state legislatures would be required.

In Colorado, Republicans would need to gain just two of the 65 seats in the House.  In Iowa, Republicans would need to gain just two of the 50 seats in the Senate.  In Kentucky, Republicans would need to gain four of the 100 seats in the House.  In Maine, Republicans would need to gain 11 of the 151 seats in the House.  In Minnesota, Republicans would need to gain six of the 67 seats in the Senate.  In New Mexico, Republicans would need to gain four of the 42 seats in the Senate.  In Washington, Republicans would need to gain two of the 98 seats in the House.

Put another way, there are 7,383 state legislative seats in America, and a shift of 31 seats, or less than one half of one percent of these seats, could give Republicans in state legislatures the power to both convene a constitutional convention and to ratify amendments proposed at that convention.  Two other states, Delaware and Oregon, could have Republican legislatures; a shift of 17 seats total would give Republicans majorities in 40 state legislatures (unlikely, but in a wave election, possible).

The amendments proposed ought to narrowly focus on the imbalance of state and federal power.  One advantage to this approach is that all state legislators would find some appeal in these amendments, and any state legislator would look absurd telling voters: ""We could not vote to ratify amendments to give us more power at the expense of Washington because Washington knows better than we do.""

What amendments? 

First, restore to state legislatures the power to elect members of the United States Senate and add the power of state legislatures to recall a senator during the term of that senator.

Second, provide that a resolution by three fifths of the state legislatures of the several states could invalidate any federal judicial, legislative, or executive action and could remove any federal official responsible for that action from office.

Third, limit the terms of all members of the federal bench of a total, for all federal judicial offices, of ten years. 

These would be reasonable, clear, and vital changes – and these amendments would also be revolutionary.  Americans, by the time of the 2018 midterm elections, may well be ready for this sort of peaceful and constitutional revolution.

100287,1008,"A Word about Welfare Queens and Their Defenders

",http://www.americanthinker.com/articles/2016/10/a_word_about_welfare_queens_and_their_defenders.html,11,"If the editors of The Atlantic had ever seen Lost, they might remember a scene when Sawyer the lovable con-man explains his father's philosophy of stealing.  It runs, in entirety, that no matter who you are or what you do for a living, you're either taking or giving too much, but you're never getting what you deserve.  The whole world is alternating between stealing or being stolen from.  The professional thief (and maybe even the saintliest of saints) might argue that he's separated from the rest of humanity only in name.  A saner man might argue back that the thief is separated from humanity more particularly by degree.

When it comes down to it, the argument over welfare queens and welfare in general is a similar issue.  The Atlantic argues that the welfare queen is a myth, and that the people getting welfare are overwhelmingly people who need it.  On the other hand, we have much of the taxpaying public, who may not necessarily even be against the idea of welfare in general but are interested in knowing whether the people who get it actually deserve it.  The left, forgetting that the taxpayer is ultimately the best judge of whether he's getting fleeced, says, How dare we question whether anyone down on his luck deserves it?  The right, with a bayonet in its face, asks whether luck, in many cases, has anything to do with it at all.

And the left's refusal to admit the existence of an unfair welfare expenditure is really the heart of the issue, as if there was never anyone who got taxpayer funding who didn't deserve it.  The truth is that even without the extravagant fraudulence of the welfare queen, we know that it happens frequently.  Anyone who knows anything about hiring in Washington State knows that many people only schedule interviews so they can keep collecting unemployment.  Anyone who's had any experience in the grocery business has seen people buying lobsters and ribeyes on food stamps.  And anyone who's worked with the homeless in downtown Seattle knows that even the obvious speed freaks get government checks – which are immediately expended on meth instead of on rent.

Whether these are the majority of instances is beside the point.  The point is that whoever is running things is more concerned about the feelings of the ""unfortunate"" than he is about the property of the virtuous.

A little reflection might prove that a healthy amount of skepticism is required in any pecuniary endeavor, which is the primary reason why we hire people called managers.  The implication in any hiring of a manager is that the people beneath him cannot be trusted to do the job without supervision and rewards and the threat of punishment, and that even our allies, the people we greet every day as we enter the office, could possibly ruin our chance at making a living.  The fact that we treat people we work with this way but refuse to treat meth heads the same is something beyond a failure of equality.  It is a failure of intelligence.  It says we may question only the people we build things with and never supervise the people who only take things away.

And even deeper than morality, this attitude proves the left's ultimate failure to perceive their biological reality.  Whether you believe we evolved from goo or were created by God, our existence as biological beings is predicated upon an attempt to get as much of what we want or we need with the least expenditure of effort.  In everything we call this principle efficiency.  If it were any other way, if any being in the world for a year decided to behave as though efficiency were irrelevant, its reserves would drain and its energy would fail, and as it continued expending recklessly without any concern for accruing, it would eventually expire in a bout of malnutrition and exhaustion.  That is why everything living is guided by the opposite principle.  Acquire; conserve; continue to live. 

Human beings (whatever we think of our spiritual nature) are ultimately founded upon this law of efficiency, and although many of us are capable of rising above it out of an appreciation for natural law or some kind of a social instinct, we realize its calling us in everything we do.  Why buy the cow when you can get the milk for free? runs into watercooler chats, which runs into people arguing about whether Christians have to pay a tithe.  All of it, from the way we deal with women to the way we deal with bosses to the way we deal with gods and governments, is influenced by our need for personal efficiency, and if we were to say the influence was wrong, we would be equally wrong as if we said it was always right.  What is important is not that we kill ourselves in fits of altruism and say that self-interest is wrong.  What's important is that we're aware of the temptations of self-interest, and that nobody at any point is exempt from the temptation of getting something for nothing.  This is the foundation of good business and good government.  And if we have welfare, it ought also to be the foundation of a sensible welfare program.

In other words, the people at The Atlantic have simply forgotten that they are people.  And forgetting that humans are humans, they have eventually ceased to be humane – not even toward the downcast minority they were ostensibly trying to help, but toward the majority that is actually responsible for helping.

100288,1009,LOOSE ENDS (12),http://www.powerlineblog.com/archives/2016/10/loose-ends-12.php,11,"As we call remember last year Yale University melted down over . . . Halloween costumes. This month the University of Wisconsin is taking steps to make sure no such thing happens on their campus, so the university’s Ethnic and Racial Studies Department is offering a “costume review” to see whether your costume is racist. How helpful of them. Here’s a suggestion for a brave student: show up for inspection in a fat suit, and present the censors with the dilemma of being called “fat-shamers” if they object to it.

• Related to Scott’s post yesterday about the language proscriptions at Princeton, I note that what used to be called “orientation” for new faculty and staff at major universities is now called “onboarding.” I don’t have any authoritative source for this, but I suspect “orientation” has been abandoned as a label because, well, you know why. Incidentally, should the program for new gay staff be called “outboarding”? Just wondering.

• And updating John’s post celebrating the inventive student at the University of Michigan who chose “His Highness” as his preferred pronoun, the predictable reaction has happened:

Friday afternoon, a University of Michigan statistics professor threatened to “punish” anybody in her class who used the school’s new pronoun designation tool to change their pronoun to “His Majesty” like YAF Chairman Grant Strobl did earlier this week.

According to student sources, the professor, identified as statistics lecturer Nadiya Fink, told her class they would be punished if they changed their pronoun to something “disrespectful” to students who are “different” than “us.”

Fink remarked, “People who do what that kid did will be punished.”

Naturally. I suggest students demand to use Imperial, Klingon, and Romulan personal pronouns, like Darth, Grand Mof, Zantei, Epitai, and Sub-Commander. That’s just for warmup. Then we roll out personal pronouns from Dungeons and Dragons. Blow the whole stupid thing up."
100289,1009,MINNESOTA IS TURNING PURPLE,http://www.powerlineblog.com/archives/2016/10/minnesota-is-turning-purple.php,11,"The United States has been, in general, trending Republican in recent years. At the state and local levels, the party is doing better than ever, and Democrats are in many places becoming an endangered species. Minnesota is one state that has been perceived as bucking that trend and remaining staunchly blue. Beneath the surface, though, the Minnesota Star Tribune reports that the state is moving toward the Republican column:

The [Cook Partisan Voter Index] has long been considered a gold standard for tracking electoral leanings over time. It’s calculated by finding the average Republican and Democratic shares of the two-party vote in a state or district spanning the previous two elections. Those numbers are compared to the national popular vote percentages for each party’s candidate in those years. This way, it’s possible to judge how much more Republican or Democratic a state or congressional district votes compared with the country as a whole.

This year, the Cook Political Report has listed Minnesota as a likely win for Democrat Hillary Clinton, with a CPVI score of D+2 derived from 2008 and 2012 election numbers — meaning the state leans two points more Democratic than the national average.

This graph shows how Minnesota has become more competitive in recent elections. Click to enlarge: In my opinion, continuation of this trend is inevitable. Minnesota is an outlier: the surrounding states are either purple (Wisconsin and Iowa) or deep red (North Dakota, South Dakota, Nebraska). Demographically, Minnesota profiles as a red to purple state. Culturally, Minnesota is conservative. To cite just one such indicator, there are more teenagers living with their two natural parents in Minnesota than any other state in the union, save one: Utah.

How soon we see Minnesota’s conservative trend reflected on the national scene depends on a number of factors. It could have happened this year; during the primary season, the Minnesota Poll found Marco Rubio leading Hillary Clinton by, as I recall, nine points. Because Republicans foolishly nominated Donald Trump, Minnesota’s official designation as a purple state has been put off by at least one election cycle. But that status is, I think, inevitable, sooner rather than later"

Calling Obamacare, “a crazy system” and “the craziest thing in the world,” the former president said “it doesn’t many any sense; the insurance model doesn’t work here.”

Clinton went on to say that Obamacare “works fine” for people with “modest” incomes or who are eligible for government subsidies, but “the people that are getting killed in this deal are small business people and individuals who make just a little too much to get any of these subsidies.” He added:

You’ve got this crazy system where all of a sudden 25 million more people have health care and then the people are out there busting it, sometimes 60 hours a week, wind up with their premiums doubled and their coverage cut in half.

Now he tell us! Why?

Donald Trump has been usually competitive for a Republican nominee in Michigan. By expressing sympathy for “the people out there busting it,” and by criticizing an unpopular program, Bill Clinton hopes to help his wife with lower-middle class voters in this state.

But Slick Willy is also expressing the view held by most left-liberal Democrats. They see Obamacare as a stop along the way to a system that provides “free” insurance for everyone — the single payer system.

By saying loud and clear what President Obama clearly can’t say now and what Hillary must not quite say, the former president seems to be preparing the battlefield for a push by the next Clinton administration to replace Obamacare with single payer. If the insurance companies are ruined by Obamacare, that might help the push.

You can watch Bill Clinton’s attack on Obamacare here, at the Daily Caller."
100291,1010,Undocumented immigrants could teach Trump a few things about paying taxes,https://thinkprogress.org/donald-trump-taxes-undocumented-immigrants-d5cee9936ab1#.68q7trb6v,11,"Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump claimed a $916 million loss on his income tax returns, the New York Times reported after receiving three pages from his filings in 1995. His tax deduction could have allowed him to avoid paying federal income taxes for about 18 years.
While Trump often likes to associate the undocumented immigrant population with criminality and economic burden, they are also a group of people who have contributed billions in taxes.

CREDIT: AP/IStock/Dylan Petrohilos
Democratic presidential rival Hillary Clinton took to Twitter on Sunday to criticize Trump’s tax returns, pointing out that the people he scapegoats have contributed more in taxes than he has.
 According to the fact-checking publication Politifact, the American workforce includes 3.1 million undocumented immigrants who paid and contributed about $13 billion in Social Security taxes in 2010. After taking out about $1 billion in benefits that some may have received, it still appears that the undocumented population contributed $12 billion. Similarly, a 2016 Institute on Taxation and Economic Policy report found that undocumented workers are a net positive to the economy, contributing roughly $11.64 billion every year, or an average eight percent of their incomes in state and local taxes.
That counters what Trump has claimed in the past. The GOP presidential candidate has cited erroneous figures that undocumented immigrants cost $113 billion in local, state, and federal taxes_—_a figure lifted from the Federation for American Immigration Reform website, an anti-immigrant organization founded by white nationalist John Tanton. "
100292,1010,Trump’s implication that PTSD is a sign of weakness is dangerous,https://thinkprogress.org/trumps-implication-that-ptsd-is-a-sign-of-weakness-is-dangerous-21e911ebd1f7#.1cslosfw3,11,"At an event in Virginia for the newly formed Retired American Warriors PAC on Monday, GOP presidential candidate Donald Trump said that “strong” veterans don’t suffer from mental health problems as a result of what they’ve experienced in combat_—_and implied that those who do are “weak.”
The event was a town-hall style event, and Trump was asked by a member of the audience what he would do about the “tragic suicide epidemic among our veterans,” and whether he would support “faith-based” interventions.
Trump’s reply, to a room full of veterans, reiterated an inaccurate but persistent stigma that mental health problems are a sign of weakness.
“When you talk about the mental health problems, when people come back from war and combat and they see things that maybe a lot of the folks in the room have seen many times over, and you’re strong and you can handle it, but a lot of people can’t handle it.”
You can watch the exchange here: Trump then went on to say that veterans who did need help should be able to get it: “We’re going to have a very very robust, very very robust level of performance having to do with mental health. We are losing so many great people who could be taken care of if they had proper care.”
Although the full context of Trump’s quote_—_which includes him emphasizing the necessity of mental care and expressing sympathy for veterans_—_is a bit less damning, Trump’s comments about “strength” immediately set off a firestorm on social media. Regardless of what came after the problematic part of the quote, implying a link between mental illness and weakness like Trump does here ultimately prevents people from getting help that they need.
According to data from RAND, 18.5 percent of service members returning from Afghanistan and Iraq suffer from PTSD or depression, and 19.5 percent report experiencing a traumatic brain injury (TBI) while deployed. While TBIs are still poorly understood, depression and changes in thought and mood are common effects of the injury.
Research from RAND also finds that only about half of veterans who need mental health treatment actually seek it.
That’s partly because, as Trump mentioned, veterans often face long waits at the VA before they can access care. Investigations into VA clinics across the country have shown the system to be plagued with appointment delays. But in addition to logistical problems, data from USGAO also names stigma as a primary cause forcing people into the shadows.
“At the end of the day, there is still stigma and fear of being labeled ‘a broken, damaged veteran.”
The National Veteran’s Foundation parses this stigma as: “embarrassment about service-related mental disabilities; shame over needing to seek mental health treatment; stigma associated with mental health issues,” and, “fear of being weak.”
It’s a sense echoed by experts and public health professionals. In January, Paul Rieckoff, founder and head of the IAVA, told Fox news that stigma was still a large part of the reason veterans don’t access care.
“I think we have made some headway, but there is a long way to go and at the end of the day, there is still stigma and fear of being labeled ‘a broken, damaged veteran,’” he told FoxNews.com.
Nor is this stigma confined to veterans_—_for all Americans suffering from mental illness, the lingering shame and association with weakness poses a huge barrier to seeking help. It also promotes substance abuse: those who are afraid to seek professional help are more likely to turn to addictive substances for self-medication.
So while Trump_—_who received five deferments from the draft, attacked war hero and former POW Sen. John McCain for being captured, and once said that avoiding STDs was his own “personal Vietnam”_—_may have been phrasing his answer as a solution, he was also contributing to the problem. His urge to reassure the room of veterans he was speaking to that he didn’t think any of them were weak enough to suffer from PTSD also speaks to a his assumption that the disorder is shameful, meant to be hidden, and not something that strong or successful veterans deal with. Trump_—_who bragged that he has “tremendous veteran support”_—_also repeated an outdated statistic about veteran suicide. The official rate from the Department of Veteran’s Affairs, as of July, puts the number of suicides per day at 20, not 22 as Trump said today and has inaccurately said in the past (to a veteran who had the correct statistic).
Trump also implied that, once veterans do get connected with appointments at the VA, the care they receive there is substandard_—_an assertion not borne up by the data. The annual Independent Budget, published by four leading veteran organizations, has consistently found that the VA serves as “a model health-care provider,” and a 2013 survey released by the U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs found that 93 percent of veterans using the VA health system have a favorable impression of it, a sense echoed by data from the Iraq and Afghanistan Veterans of America (IAVA).

100293,1010,The many times Trump has been accused of harassing female employees,https://thinkprogress.org/trump-female-employees-d3ffc266ff3a#.luhnd8777,11,"Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump likes to boast that he’s been a great boss for his female employees. “I’ve hired tremendous numbers of women,” he bragged in March. “Women are in the highest executive positions.” He claims that his business deals have given “hundreds and hundreds of women, thousands of women” career opportunities.
He did indeed promote women into executive roles at his companies at a time when they were scarce in C-suites, telling them that while men are better than women, “a good woman is better than 10 good men.”
But no matter how he may have boosted the careers of some women, other accounts tell another, simultaneous story: employees claim that he repeatedly harassed and demeaned women who worked for him.
On Monday, the Associated Press published interviews with dozens of former employees on Donald Trump’s reality TV show “The Apprentice.”
Many of those interviewed by the AP recalled Trump talking about which female contestants he found attractive and wanted to sleep with, even in front of cameras, and asking male contestants who they would sleep with.
In the middle of the taping of one episode, one former crew member said, “He just stopped in the middle and pointed to someone and said, ‘You’d fuck her, wouldn’t you? I’d fuck her. C’mon, wouldn’t you?” At other times, he would use a break in conversation during episodes to ask male contestants to rate the attractiveness of the female ones with the cameras rolling.
One comment even made it onto air: After female contestant Brande Roderick had sunk to her knees to beg for a position on “The Celebrity Apprentice,” Trump told her, “That must be a pretty picture, you dropping to your knees.” A number of former crew members interviewed by the AP remembered him having his eyes on one camerawoman in particular. He would stop production to make comments about her buttocks, as well as to compare her to looks to those of his daughter, Ivanka. “I remember him comparing Ivanka to her and saying that only Ivanka was prettier,” Rebecca Arndt, a camera assistant, recalled. “It was supposed to be considered a compliment, but of course it was inappropriate.”
Cast members also remember him asking one female contestant to twirl in front of him so he could look at her body. He reportedly wanted the women to wear more revealing dresses and asked one woman about her breast size.
The Trump campaign has denied all of the stories reported by the AP. “These outlandish, unsubstantiated, and totally false claims fabricated by publicity hungry, opportunistic, disgruntled former employees, have no merit whatsoever,” said Hope Hicks, Trump’s campaign spokeswoman, told the outlet.
But they are far from the only allegations that Trump has harassed and mistreated women who worked for him.
One woman who encountered Trump in a professional setting sued him for sexual harassment as well as sexual assault, claiming he attempted to rape her. Jill Harth and her then-fiancé George Houraney, who was also her business partner, flew up to New York to have a meeting with Trump in 1992 to give him a presentation about working together on a beauty pageant.
According to the complaint she filed, in the middle of the meeting Trump turned to Houraney and asked, “Are you sleeping with her?” At the next meeting, Harth alleged that Trump put his hands on her thighs and genitals under the table against her will and then later in the evening introduced her to business associates as his “new girlfriend.”
Harth alleged that he then began making lewd comments and demands, calling her on the phone to demand that she “sleep with him.”
Then in January 1993, the complaint says that after a business meeting concluded he forcibly brought her to a bedroom and subjected her to unwanted advances, including touching her genitals, in “attempted rape.”
“He put out that he’s the type of guy that gets what he wants,” Harth told radio station WNYC in August about the alleged assault from Trump. “Donald gets what he wants. And he was annoyed and insulted that I wasn’t going for it with him… for me, it was unwanted and aggressive, very sexually aggressive.”
“Let me just say, this was a very traumatic thing working for him,” she said in her testimony while the lawsuit was ongoing.
Harth eventually withdrew her case as a condition of a settlement Trump reached with Houraney over a separate lawsuit over a breach of contract. In response to WNYC’s story, the Trump campaign said, “Mr. Trump denies each and every statement made by Ms. Harth, as these 24-year-old allegations lack any merit or veracity.” Many stories of his inappropriate behavior come from Trump’s tenure managing the Miss USA and Miss Universe contests. Temple Taggart, who was a contestant in 1997, says he kissed her on the lips. “I thought, ‘Oh my god, gross,’” she told the New York Times earlier this year. “I think there were a few other girls that he kissed on the mouth. I was like ‘Wow, that’s inappropriate.’”
Carrie Prejean, another contestant, has written about Trump demeaning the contestants en masse. They were made to line up in their swimsuits on stage, and he walked by all of them, inspecting them “closer than any general ever inspected a platoon,” she wrote. “It became clear that the point of the whole exercise was for him to divide the room between girls he personally found attractive and those he did not. Many of the girls found the exercise humiliating.”
One story has gained notoriety in particular: his public humiliation of Miss Universe winner Alicia Machado for gaining some weight once she got the crown. Other contestants have also said he told them to lose weight; one said he told her to “suck [her] stomach in.”
The behavior also showed up in his high-level business dealings. Barbara Res, who worked as executive vice president at the Trump Organization, said she had to endure humiliating observations about her body too. She says Trump told her, “You like your candy” after she had gained some weight. “It was him reminding me that I was overweight,” she told the New York Times.
Res described Trump placing outsized importance on lower-level female employees’ looks: For an important business meeting, he told her to get a prettier female employee to take lunch orders. “That was purely about looks,” she said. “He wanted the people in that room to think that all the women who worked for him were beautiful.”
These kinds of allegations even made it into court battles. As part of a lawsuit brought against one of Trump’s golf clubs over a lack of meal and rest breaks in 2012, as reported by the Los Angeles Times, employees and managers described being pressured to hire and display attractive young women and to fire overweight ones at Trump’s behest.
“I had witnessed Donald Trump tell managers many times while he was visiting the club that restaurant hostesses were ‘not pretty enough’ and that they should be fired and replaced with more attractive women,” Hayley Strozier, director of catering at the club until 2008, said in a sworn declaration. She also said that two different Trump employees told her to fire a woman “because ‘Mr. Trump doesn’t like fat people.’”
Other employees reported that several women were fired or quit because they were told they weren’t pretty enough.
In the same court documents, other employees described inappropriate behavior from Trump when he visited the club. He allegedly brought one “young, attractive” hostess over to a meeting and then said to the other men present, “See, you don’t have to go to Hollywood to find beautiful women,” then turned to the woman and asked, “Do you like Jewish men?” Another server recalled that she “consistently found Mr. Trump to be overly familiar and unprofessional.”
Trump settled most of the lawsuits without admitting any wrongdoing, while one employee’s claim that she was fired for complaining about how the company treated women was settled separately. "
100294,1001,Donald Trump was paid $5 million by the Saudi government,http://www.dailykos.com/stories/2016/10/4/1577831/-Donald-Trump-was-paid-5-million-by-the-Saudi-government,12,"Confronted about the shutdown of his father’s slush fund/“charity,” Eric Trump first pleaded ignorance.

Yeah, well, I know very little about it to tell you the truth.
But of course, no Trump can talk on any subject without trying to twist it into a Hillary attack, so …

You look at the Clinton Foundation taking $35 million from Saudi Arabia, who is one of the largest abusers of women and minorities in the world, and then three days later getting weapons deals from the State Department .
Yeah … about that. Hillary Clinton got not a penny from the Clinton Foundation. Neither did Bill. However, there was one person who took a nice chunk of change directly from the Saudi government.

Trump sold the 45th floor of Trump World Tower to the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia for $4.5 million in June 2001, according to a city Finance Department spokeswoman. In 2008, the apartments became part of the Saudi Mission to the United Nations, records show.
Are you registered to vote? Click here to make sure. #KnowYourStatus

Including fees that Trump continues to charge, “one of the largest abusers of women and minorities in the world” has directly paid Donald Trump more than $5 million. This is in addition to the news that Trump also rented space to an Iranian bank that was involved in funding terrorist and exporting nuclear secrets.

U.S. officials later alleged that Bank Melli had been used to obtain sensitive materials for Iran’s nuclear program. U.S. authorities also alleged that the bank had been used between 2002 and 2006 to funnel money to a unit of the Iranian Revolutionary Guard that has sponsored terrorist attacks — a period that overlapped with the time the bank rented office space from Trump.

Donald Trump’s international business is entangled with political factions around the world, not least of all Vladimir Putin's authoritarian Russian government. But even when Trump is simply playing landlord, he’s making connections where he gets direct benefit from foreign governments.

Charges that Hillary Clinton had taken money from foreign governments have become one of the standard parts of Trump’s nightly rants. But the worst thing that could have happened with that $35 million that went to the Clinton Foundation? It went to help some of the more than 400 million people who have been helped by the foundation.

The worst thing that happened to the $5 million paid directly to Donald Trump? It went to Donald Trump."
100295,1001,Mike Pence's cruel and un-Christianapproach to immigration and refugees is perfectly Trumpian,http://www.dailykos.com/stories/2016/10/4/1577803/-Mike-Pence-s-cruel-and-un-Christian-approach-to-immigration-and-refugees-is-perfectly-Trumpian,12,"Mike Pence has always described himself as a Christian, first and foremost, before being a conservative and a Republican. Somehow, it's through that twisted frame that Mike Pence took it upon himself to usurp authority he doesn't actually have and ban Syrian refugees, with their horrific war-torn reality, from resettling in Indiana. Not only was it inhumane, it violated federal law, a federal appeals court found Monday, upholding the ruling of a lower court.

Pence's fear-mongering about Syrian refugees, which the ruling labeled ""nightmare speculation,"" is a perfect fit for the foundation of Donald Trump's entire nativist-fueled candidacy, which has cruelly targeted refugees, undocumented immigrants, and DREAMers. 

Pence also signed on to the GOP-led lawsuit that has indefinitely stalled deportation relief for up to 5 million DREAM activists and undocumented parents of American-born children. In fact, Pence has taken a particularly repulsive approach to DREAMers, in particular, who were brought here as minors by their parents, saying: 

We should not reward people with citizenship whose first act in this country was a violation of the law.
Frustrated you don't live in a swing state? No matter where you live, MoveOn has a great way for you to get involved where it matters most. Check it out!

Apparently being relocated by your parents was their ""first act,"" because they had agency in that situation. As a member of Congress, Pence was also an early adopter of ""report to deport,"" a policy requiring the undocumented to first return to their countries of origin before applying for a guest worker program.

The immigration group America's Voice has a couple of key questions for Pence during tonight's debate.

1) You have said you will immediately end President Obama’s executive actions on immigration, including the DACA program that currently protects 750,000 young people commonly referred to as DREAMers from deportation. Would you subject them to deportation?

2) Polls consistently show that by a 3-1 margin Americans believe undocumented immigrants should be able to gain legal status by meeting certain criteria, rather than be deported. Why do you support the deportation of most of these people, especially given the multiple reports that doing so would cause significant damage to the economy and impose significant costs on the federal government?
Here's another good one: How on earth is it Christian, in your view, to ban refugees who are facing unimaginable violence and living conditions in their country from taking shelter with the borders of your state?"
100296,1001,"During the debate, remember these six times Mike Pence sounded just like Donald Trump",http://www.dailykos.com/stories/2016/10/4/1577785/-During-the-debate-remember-these-six-times-Mike-Pence-sounded-like-Donald-Trump,12,"Mike Pence’s job in the vice presidential debate is to give establishment Republicans and the media a way to present Donald Trump’s campaign as … not quite so Trumpy. Polite and, if not moderate, at least unlikely to provoke nuclear war. That’s going to be a tough job given Pence’s own not-moderate record and all the recent times he’s echoed Trump at his worst.

Those echoes are the subject of a new video from the Clinton campaign, highlighting times Pence has sounded awfully much like Trump. (Watch the video below.)

Neither man would disavow white supremacist leader David Duke.
Both Trump and Pence want to see Roe v. Wade overturned—Pence wants it “consigned to the ash heap of history” and Trump believes women have to be punished for abortion.
Immigration? Pence says “The American people don’t want comprehensive immigration reform,” and Trump … we know about Trump and immigration.
Pence signed a right-to-discriminate law. Trump would “strongly consider” appointing Supreme Court justices to overturn marriage equality. (Yes, Pence is worse on this issue.)
Global warming is “a myth” according to Pence and “a hoax” according to Trump.
Pence voted against raising the minimum wage in Congress. Trump would oppose raising it as president.
Yep. They seem like a pretty good fit. Remember that when Pence is trying to put a bland, non-threatening face on the Trump campaign—and pundits and commentators are giving him credit for the effort."
100297,1002,"Americans Don’t Have Any Right to Block Islamic Immigration, Says Tim Kaine",http://www.breitbart.com/2016-presidential-race/2016/10/04/americans-cant-block-muslim-immigration-kaine/,12,"Americans do not have any right to stop Islamic immigration into the United States, the Democratic vice-presidential candidate said Tuesday night.
“Hillary and I will do immigration enforcement and we’ll vet refugees based on whether they’re dangerous or not,” Virginia Sen. Tim Kaine said at the Virginia vice-presidential debate.  “We won’t do it based on discriminating against you from the country you come from or the religion that you practice,” he said, in a reference to Donald Trump’s broad opposition to Islamic immigration. 

“Discriminating” against Islamic believers “is completely antithetical to the Jeffersonian values,” Kaine claimed. 

The claim matches a September tweet from the Clinton campaign, which suggested that foreign Muslims have a right to immigrate into the United States.  In contrast, GOP Gov. Mike Pence, said he and President Donald Trump do put the interests of Americans before those of foreigners. “The immigration issue “really does begin with us reforming our immigration system and putting the interests, particularly the safety and security of the American people, first,” Pence said.

“Donald Trump has called for extreme vetting for people coming into this country so that we don’t bring people into the United States who are hostile to our Bill of Rights freedoms, who are hostile to the American way life,” he added.

Polls show that Trump’ds policy is backed by a strong majority of Americans. 

First, the poll asked whether tourists and immigrants should be screened to check for their possible support of Islamic sharia. Seventy percent of respondents approved of the screening.

The poll then asked the 70 percent; “Do you believe that individuals who support the practice of [Islamic] Sharia law should be admitted into the United States?”  No, responded four-fifths of the 70 percent. That translates into 56 percent of total respondents backing Trump’s proposed policy of excluding sharia-supporting Muslims.

The overall opposition to the exclusion of sharia supporters added up to just 20 percent, with the rest undecided.

In the debate, Pence opposed Clinton’s plans to increase the inflow of Islamic refugees from Syria. “The director of the FBI, our homeland security, said we can’t know for certain who these people are coming from Syria.”

Kaine supported Clinton’s refugee plan, and insisted that intelligence agencies can determine which migrants from chaotic Syria will become a threat in the next few decades. “Yes, we can, and when we don’t let them know, we don’t let them in … When we don’t know who they are, we don’t let them in.”

Under policies set by President Barack Obama, Islamic immigration is sharply increasing in the United States. In 2014, Obama also said Americans do not have any right to decide which foreigners can migrate into their homeland. “There have been periods where the folks who were already here suddenly say, ‘Well, I don’t want those [foreign] folks,’ even though the only people who have the right to say that are some Native Americans,” he said in November 2014. 

On Monday, law enforcement officials announced they are pressing charges against an Islamic immigrant — Nelash Mohamed Das — who arrived from Bangladesh as a child in 1995. According to prosecutors, 

Das tweeted a picture of an AK-47 assault rifle, prosecutors said, and wrote, “This is more than just a gun. This is a ticket to Jannah” — a reference, prosecutors said, to “the Islamic concept of paradise.”

On Twitter, Das also expressed envy of people “slaying kuffar” — killing nonbelievers — and dying as religious martyrs, prosecutors said…

The Islamic killers in the jihad massacres in San Bernardino, Orlando, Fort Hood, and Chattanooga, were the children of Islamic immigrants. Another famous jihadi, Anwar Al Awlaqi, was the Texas-born son of Islamic immigrants from Yemen. 

“The FBI and homeland security said we can’t know for certain” which Islamic refugees are safe to import, Pence said. “You’ve got to err on the side of the safety and security of the American people, Senator.”

Pence repeatedly criticized Kaine and Clinton’s mass-immigration policy on crime and on economic grounds. “Hillary Clinton and Tim Kaine want to continue the policies of open borders, amnesty, catch and release, sanctuary cities, all the things that are driving — that are driving wages down in this country, Senator, and also too often with criminal aliens in the country, it’s bringing heartbreak,” he said. 

“Ronald Reagan said a nation without borders is not a nation,” Pence added. “Donald Trump is committed to restoring the borders of this nation and securing our nation, enforcing our laws.”

Kaine tried to defend Clinton’s promise to end repatriation of illegal immigrants with “family” in the United States, and to award Green Cards to an unlimited number of foreigners who graduate from American colleges.

“There’s two plans on the table,” Kaine said.

Hillary and I believe in comprehensive immigration reform. Donald Trump believes in deportation nation. You’ve got to pick your choice. Hillary and I want a bipartisan reform that will put keeping families together as the top goal, second, that will help focus enforcement efforts on those who are violent, third, that will do more border control, and, fourth, that will provide a path to citizenship for those who work hard, pay taxes, play by the rules, and take criminal background record checks.

That’s our proposal. Donald Trump proposes to deport 16 million people, 11 million who are here without documents. And both Donald Trump and Mike Pence want to get rid of birthright citizenship. So if you’re born here, but your parents don’t have documents, they want to eliminate that. That’s another 4.5 million people.

In turn, Pence touted Trump’s labor and immigration policy.

Donald Trump has a plan that he laid out in Arizona, that will deal systemically with illegal immigration, beginning with border security, internal enforcement. It’s probably why for the first time in the history of Immigration and Customs Enforcement their union actually endorsed Donald Trump as the next president of the United States, because they know they need help to enforce the laws of this country.

And Donald Trump has laid out a priority to remove criminal aliens, remove people that have overstayed their visas. And — and once we have accomplished all of that, which will — which will strengthen our economy, strengthen the rule of law in the country and make our communities safer once the criminal aliens are out, then we’ll deal with those that remain.

Pence also said that “after we secure the border, not only build a wall, but beneath the ground and in the air, we do internal enforcement.”

The [initial] focus has to be on criminal aliens. We just — we just had a conversation about law enforcement. We just had a conversation about the — the violence that’s besetting our cities. The reality is that there’s heartbreak and tragedy that has struck American families because people that came into this country illegally are now involved in criminal enterprise and activity. And we don’t have the resources or the will to deport them systemically.

Donald Trump has said we’re going to move those people out, people who’ve overstayed their visas. We’re going to enforce the law of this country. We’re going to strengthen Immigrations and Customs Enforcement with more resources and more personnel to be able to do that. And then Donald Trump has made it clear, once we’ve done all of those things, that we’re going to reform the immigration system that we have.

Each year, 4 million Americans turn 18 years old and enter the workforce. But, each year, the federal government also imports 2 million immigrants, guest-workers, refugees and asylum seekers and illegal immigrants. The inflow of  workers drives down the salaries of American white-collar and blue-collar workers while boosting income for investors and employers. The inflow also sharply increases tax transfers from Americans to immigrants. "
100298,1002,"Kaine Dodges on Clinton Trust Numbers, Emails, and Foundation",http://www.breitbart.com/video/2016/10/04/kaine-dodges-on-clinton-trust-numbers-emails-and-foundation/,12,"During Tuesday’s Vice Presidential debate, vice presidential nominee Senator Tim Kaine (D-VA) answered a question on Democratic presidential nominee former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton’s trust numbers and whether they are due to the Clinton Foundation and her emails with an answer that never directly referred to the Clinton Foundation or Clinton’s emails.

Kaine said, in response to a question on Clinton’s trustworthiness numbers, and whether it was due to her emails and the Clinton Foundation, “Elaine, let me tell you why I trust Hillary Clinton. Here’s what people should look at as they look at a public servant: Do they have a passion in their life that showed up before they were in public life, and have they held on to that passion throughout their life, regardless of whether they were in office or not, succeeding or failing? Hillary Clinton has that passion, from a time as a kid in a Methodist youth group in the suburbs of Chicago, she has been focused on serving others, with a special focus on empowering families and kids. As a civil rights lawyer in the South, with the Children’s Defense Fund, First Lady of Arkansas, and this country’s Senator, Secretary of State, it’s always been about putting others first. And that’s a sharp contrast with Donald Trump. Donald Trump always puts himself first. He built a business career, in the words of one of his own campaign staffers, off the backs of the little guy. And as a candidate, he started his campaign with a speech where he called Mexicans rapists and criminals, and he has pursued the discredited and really outrageous lie that President Obama wasn’t born in the United States. It is so painful to suggest that we go back to think about these days where an African-American could not be a citizen of the United States, and I can’t imagine how Governor Pence can defend the insult-driven, selfish, me-first style of Donald Trump.”

After GOP presidential nominee Governor Mike Pence (R-IN) brought up the Clinton Foundation, Kaine responded to saying Pence was “Trump’s apprentice.” After Pence again brought up the Clinton Foundation and Clinton’s emails, Kaine pivoted to Osama Bin Laden’s killing, the lowering of the number of troops from Iraq, and her record on Iran and Russia."
100299,1002,"After Tim Kaine Flops in Vice Presidential Debate, New Doubts About Hillary",http://www.breitbart.com/big-government/2016/10/04/tim-kaine-loses-vp-debate-new-doubts-hillary/,12,"Sen. Tim Kaine (D-VA) lost badly to Indiana Gov. Mike Pence in Tuesday night’s vice presidential debate — despite having home field advantage in Farmville, Virginia — raising new doubts about Hillary Clinton.
Those doubts are twofold: first, about her decision to choose so weak a candidate, who seemed unable to answer basic policy questions; and second, about Clinton’s health, since if her medical troubles are as bad as feared, Kaine may be taking over at some point if she is elected.

Kaine could not stop interrupting Pence, at times sounding high-pitched and shrill, at times whining and defensive. Pence was cool and even-tempered — presidential, in other words, while Kaine seemed to be playing cable news pundit.

The Democrat was often unable to suppress the juvenile impulse to shout campaign talking points, even in the middle of his opponent’s answers. At one point, he interjected: “Our plan is like Ronald Reagan’s plan from 1986.” (Note to Democrats: the Reagan plan failed.)

Later, when the moderator asked why Putin would respect a Trump-Pence administration, Pence answered: “Strength.” Kaine, unable to restrain himself, blurted out: “Business deals.” His smirk betrayed his conviction that he had just scored points, even though the moderator had to instruct him — for the third time, at least — to wait until it was his turn to speak.

Kaine seemed not to understand how un-serious he looked. Pence responded with a steady, and appropriate, put-down: “That’s nonsense.”

Pence also beat Kaine over the head with the Russian “reset,” Clinton’s email scandal, and the Clinton Foundation. Moderator Elaine Quijano of CBS News stepped in to protect Kaine, especially when it came to the email scandal (though, to her credit, she at least asked about it, unlike NBC News’ Lester Holt in the first presidential debate).

There was nothing in Tim Kaine’s performance that showed he could act like a president. Pence aced that test.

Now the hard questions for Hillary will begin."
100300,1003,Hillary the Lion-Hearted Does Battle with the Trumpasaurus,http://www.huffingtonpost.com/carla-seaquist/hillary-the-lionhearted-d_b_12306378.html?utm_hp_ref=politics,12,"Finally! Hillary Clinton got off the back foot in her battle with the Trumpasaurus—-the behemoth who’s wrecked the political landscape and now threatens to take the White House—-and, in an audacious attack, she bested him, leaving him stunned.

It was a thrilling sight at the first presidential debate: Clinton, calm, coifed, and prepared like an actor taking on the part of a lifetime, decimating the Blowhard-Who-Never-Prepares, Donald Trump. Cannily, Clinton invoked personal references and served them up in unending volley—-Trump’s millionaire father, her own small-businessman father, contractors who were “stiffed” by Trump, a Miss Universe whom Trump as pageant owner maligned as “Miss Piggy” and “Miss Housekeeping” (she is Latina)—-to pierce through the big man’s thin skin.

It worked. Trump seethed and, seething, revealed his real beliefs: that it’s “smart” not to pay taxes. That he cheered the collapse of the housing market because he could snap up distressed properties (“That’s called business, by the way”). That business, as he practices it, is not about serving the client’s interests but his own profits. That, sure, contractors get “stiffed” if he declares himself unsatisfied with their finished work.

All these were revelations—-each stunning on its own—-that none of his sixteen Republican primary opponents were able either to elicit or make stick. Investigative reporters have unearthed many of Trump’s more questionable business practices and biographical sleaze. The media now refer to his many misrepresentations as “lies” (also here and here). But, dismayingly, little has stuck.

Until, that is, the lady in the red pantsuit, working her sword arm in front of an audience of 90 million—-largest ever for a debate—-made it stick, resoundingly and dramatically. Trump was left blithering. He was still rampaging about the “Miss Universe” jab almost a week later, tweeting responses at 3 a.m.

Such a feat took a battle plan—-strategy, tactics, study, rehearsal. It also took an innate faith in the American people that the points she aimed to make about Trump would compute onstage in a way they hadn’t when presented as news (they did, and how). Taking the longer view, that performance also required all the battle-scarred experience, speechifying, and time spent in the trenches that Clinton has racked up in more than four decades devoted to public service. Experience does count.

It also took—-let us acknowledge it—-courage. Simple but all-too-rare courage, the lion-hearted kind. The kind of courage Anonymous defined as “fear that has said its prayers.” With her campaign stalled, and under withering criticism from Democrats as well as Republicans for her self-inflicted “deplorables” gaffe, she had to produce at that debate. And, digging deep, she did. Hillary Clinton demonstrated the mettle required for the White House.

As a feminist I’m not one for any special pleading for women in public life. Male or female, candidates must clear the bar, no handicapping allowed. But, apart from the rigors of the job interview, this presidential campaign featuring our first female nominee has been suffused in misogyny, unleashed by none other than Trump himself. When in the debate Hillary cited Trump’s reference to women as “pigs, slobs, and dogs,” insults now free-flowing in the public, that was pushback, long in coming, from all women sick of being demeaned. You don’t think that took courage?

And to those who say both performances, Clinton’s and Trump’s, were farce, I say: This is the man who’s taken campaign politics to a new low, starting with reference to the size of his manhood. Hillary faced the classic problem: How do you wrestle with a pig? Doing so is usually thought to be a lose-lose proposition: You both get dirty and the pig enjoys it. Hillary finally solved that problem, not by going abstract or platitudinous, but by raising each ugly Trumpism, parrying with personal examples, then executing by taking it to higher ground.

For this reason, Hillary’s debate performance was more than great spectacle with rhetorical zingers. When she thrust home, it was to make a higher, human point. About Trump calling Miss Universe “Miss Piggy,” this life-long humanitarian struck the human note: “Donald, she has a name.” She worked the same humanizing effect on stiffed contractors and dumb taxpayers. As Michelle Obama says, “When they go low, we go high.” In this low and dishonest age, going high and human is exhilarating, also possibly nation-saving.

(Message to young people: This is how you combat a bully. You unmask him, inch by inch by inch. You can start now with the class bullies who, aping Trump, taunt Latino classmates with “Build a wall.” Think Hillary, and Michelle, and go to it.)

Finally, Hillary Clinton deserves a citation for courage for bearing the false burden of the media’s false equivalence, of treating her candidacy on a (low) par with Trump’s. Yes, she’s made mistakes, notably her decision as Secretary of State to use a private email server: You only have to work one day in Washington to know any work-product instantly becomes property of the U.S. Government. But this mistake pales in comparison to Trump’s myriad business frauds and serial lies. And, unlike No-Apology Trump, Hillary has apologized for her mistake. She did so again in that first debate, before going on to stun the Trumpasaurus.

That lion-hearted display has re-energized Hillary’s campaign, her supporters, and Democratic candidates down-ballot. Showing new fire in attacking a rigged economy, Clinton is exploiting the revelation she forced out of Trump that it’s “smart” not to pay taxes (“What does that make the rest of us?”). Her new ad exploits the revelation reported by The New York Times that in 1995 Trump declared a loss of almost one billion dollars and possibly avoided paying taxes for nearly two decades.

Meanwhile Trump, becoming increasingly erratic, promises to descend even lower in the next debate. Hillary will be ready.

Finding her sword arm—-finally—-Clinton has come into her best self, which I predict will carry her to victory. But whatever the outcome, it’s enough to have seen Hillary the Lion-Hearted do battle with the Trumpasaurus and best him. It gives one, in this wretched presidential campaign, a whiff of the mythic and a glimpse of a New Day."
100301,1003,How Trump’s Attack on Democracy Sets Up Hillary to Win Youth Vote,http://www.huffingtonpost.com/don-tapscott/how-trumps-attack-on-demo_b_12335312.html?utm_hp_ref=politics,12,"When Donald Trump says the system is rigged, how should we respond? Most of the pros, both Democratic and Republican, have said Donald Trump’s claim is not only outrageously wrong, but is dangerous for American democracy. But what happens if a significant number of Americans, both Republican and Democratic, suspect that he’s right, that the system is somehow unfair?

Take a look at voters under 30, who make up 21 percent of eligible voters in the U.S. Less than 20 percent of them voted in the last federal election, and you only have to listen to replays of the Bernie Sanders campaign to see why.

Most young Americans are understandably disgusted at the way that Big Money has corrupted the political process and distorted the way decisions are made in Washington. When they look at Washington, they see that too many U.S. politicians are beholden to wealthy contributors and interest groups. Exhibit A:  Over 90 percent of Americans want background checks on people buying guns, but legislation has been thwarted by the rich and powerful National Rifle Association. Is this “government of the people, by the people, for the people?” You tell me.

This is a serious problem. As the American political sociologist Seymour Martin Lipset put it, legitimacy is based on belief — “ the belief that existing political institutions are the most appropriate and proper ones for the society.” The ongoing abuse of trust by elected and appointed office holders in modern-day democracies is not simply a series of isolated incidents but a manifestation of a deep and widespread rot. The result is a full-blown crisis of legitimacy.

“It’s rigged” plays straight into this current of discontent about the legitimacy of the political process. The danger is that large numbers of people may seek alternatives to democratic capitalism, ranging from anarchism and radical libertarianism to authoritarian communism and even theocracies like fundamentalist Muslims propose. There is even a growing danger of fascism with the rise of the far-right and even expressly fascist movements in the Europe and other places.

What does Hillary Clinton need to do?

For starters, Clinton can take a page from Barack Obama’s first campaign. Obama’s 2008 campaign used the Internet to build a movement. MyBarackObama.com gave supporters tools to organize themselves. Instead of being told what to do from up high, people could create communities themselves, raise money, and induce people not only to vote but to get involved in the Obama campaign.

What emerged was an unprecedented force: Thirteen million supporters connected to one another over the Internet, and self-organized to build thirty-five thousand communities of people with common interests. When young people chanted “Yes We Can,” it wasn’t just a slogan of hope; it was an affirmation of collective power.

It’s true that in the hurly burly of Washington, that hope fizzled. The first Internet president, as Obama was once called, missed a historic opportunity to engage all those communities in the decisions of government. By the 2012 election, he had shifted gears. Instead of engaging citizens to organize on their own, Obama’s election machine used Big Data to swing voters and raise money. Instead of “Yes We Can,” the Modus Operandi of the Obama 2012 campaign sounded like “We Know You.”

It was the expedient route to power. Obama used social media to broadcast messages and raise funds through data-enriched targeted advertising online. The strategy worked in getting him elected, but it came with hidden costs. Young people turned off, and tuned out of politics and government. The legitimacy of government, in the eyes of Millennials, was eroded.

It was disappointing, to be sure, but that does not undermine the value of using the power of self-organization via the Internet to bring young people back into the political tent, and bolster the legitimacy of government for Americans.

To be effective, Clinton should abandon the school principal habit of simply broadcasting her message to her audience and focus on engaging with them. She needs to resist the temptation to preach from the top down and use Big Data to orchestrate her campaign. Instead she should set up, as Obama did in 2008, a way for Millennials to self-organize so they can help her win.

This is, to be sure, a big shift for Clinton, but it may ensure she gets elected.  More important, it can re-engage America’s youth in democracy."
100302,1003,How A Twitter Storm Trumped Nuclear Winter,http://www.huffingtonpost.com/nick-turse/how-a-twitter-storm-trump_b_12332208.html?utm_hp_ref=politics,12,"Last month, near the end of the first presidential debate, Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton laid a masterful trap for her Republican rival. Reminding viewers of Donald Trump’s frequent crude comments about women, she mentioned “a woman in a beauty contest,” and then unpacked the story of former Miss Universe Alicia Machado.

“And he called this woman ‘Miss Piggy,’” Clinton told around 80 million Americans. “Then he called her ‘Miss Housekeeping,’ because she was Latina.”

Clinton paused, waited, and revealed her name.

“Where did you find this? Where did you find this?” Trump sputtered, to which Clinton countered with a kicker: “She has become a U.S. citizen, and you can bet she’s going to vote this November.”

A more conventional candidate than The Donald might have spent that night and the next day carefully prying the jaws of the bear trap off his leg and licking his wounds, but Clinton and her coterie knew their opponent well. No doubt stung by his overall poor performance and a wave of withering criticism over his treatment of Machado two decades earlier, Trump figured out a way to squeeze his other leg into the vice grip of that metal maw. As Machado and the Clinton campaign carried out a masterfully orchestrated media blitz, the Republican hopeful went on Fox News to double down. “She gained a massive amount of weight and it was a real problem,” he told the seemingly shell-shocked hosts of Fox and Friends.

Days later, the story was still going strong, garnering media attention, generating headlines, and prompting discussions about everything from Trump’s own weight (five pounds shy of clinical obesity) to his past comments about the size of a pregnant Kim Kardashian culminating in an early morning Twitter storm last Friday.

This is American politics today: crude, crass, freewheeling, and tending toward the frivolous. America has had sexist, misogynist presidents, of course. Some have been astonishingly lewd and crude. I’m looking at you, LBJ!

Lyndon Baines Johnson may have been an incorrigible bully and inveterate womanizer — to say nothing of the copious amounts of Vietnamese blood on his hands — but his 1964 campaign featured a nuclear war-themed political attack ad that, though only aired once, is still lodged in the American consciousness.

At the end of that so-called Daisy ad, as a mushroom cloud rises onscreen, we hear Johnson’s voice: “These are the stakes. To make a world in which all of God’s children can live, or to go into the dark. We must either love each other, or we must die.” The implication was clear. Johnson’s Republican opponent, Senator Barry Goldwater of Arizona, was too dangerous to entrust with America’s nuclear arsenal.

Clinton has made a similar point about Trump. “A man you can bait with a tweet is not a man we can trust with nuclear weapons,” she’s said — a suitable enough line but without a Daisy punch. Barring a Trump win and a resulting nuclear exchange, don’t expect people to remember it 50 years from now. Don’t even hold your breath about whether it might affect a single news cycle between now and Election Day or morph into the kind of substantive discussion of nuclear policy that spawns 100 headlines and a million tweets. There have been many scandals deserving of mention during this long presidential campaign, many controversies demanding attention, many travesties deserving of discussion but as Andrew Bacevich, author most recently of America’s War for the Greater Middle East, observes today in “What We Talk About When We Don’t Want to Talk About Nuclear War,” the biggest travesty may be that an issue with the potential to end life as we know it on this planet can’t compete with one candidate’s seemingly hysterical obsession with publicly criticizing women’s bodies."
100303,1004,"Trump Takes Heat From Mental Health Advocates, Dems On PTSD Comments",http://talkingpointsmemo.com/livewire/trump-veterans-mental-health-ptsd,12,"Donald Trump's suggestion Monday that victims of post-traumatic stress disorder and combat-related suicide aren't as ""strong"" as their comrades comes amid a push to destigmatize mental health issues in the military, drawing strong reactions from those close to the issue.

""People come back from war and combat and they see things that maybe a lot of the folks in this room have seen many times over,"" Trump said during a town hall hosted by the Retired American Warriors in Herndon, Virginia. ""And you're strong and you can handle it, but a lot of people can't handle it.""

He went on to call for stronger mental health initiatives for veterans, but critics were quick to jump on the implication that veterans who need those mental health services are not ""strong.""

""It is not a sign of weakness to get help. In fact, it’s a sign of character and a sign of strength to ensure that you’re taking care of yourself,"" White House press secretary Josh Earnest said in a Monday briefing in reaction to Trump's comments.

Vice President Joe Biden also slammed the remarks as ""ignorant"" during an interview with CNN's Chris Cuomo later the same day.

""This guy says things he has no idea about,"" Biden said. ""How can he be so out of touch and asked to lead this country?""

PTSD ""is not a reflection of a person's strength, character, stamina - any of that,"" David Maulsby, the executive director of the PTSD Foundation of America, told the Associated Press. ""Our veterans who are struggling with post-traumatic stress as a result of their combat need to be encouraged to seek help, and not be told they are weak or deficient in character in any way, shape or form.""

Zach Iscol told the AP that Trump's suggestion ""shows a complete misunderstanding of what post-traumatic stress disorder is."" Iscol is a veteran and executive director of the Headstrong Project, which helps provide free mental health services to veterans.

Iscol added that Trump's comments weren't ""just wrong, they're dangerous.""

Paul Rieckhoff, the founder of Iraq and Afghanistan Veterans of America, reacted on Twitter, saying that Trump was sending the ""wrong message."" Veterans also took to Twitter to criticize Trump's remarks:

View image on Twitter
 John Weaver, a senior consultant for Ohio Gov. John Kasich's (R) 2016 presidential campaign, seized the opportunity to point out that Trump received five draft deferments at the height of the Vietnam War and has not served in the military. And Evan McMullin, the longshot independent presidential candidate highlighted Trump's attacks on the Khan family in his response. Not all veterans groups and veterans were bothered by the GOP nominee's take on who can handle the stress of war, though.

Retired Army Lt. Gen. Michael Flynn released a statement in Trump's defense on Monday, blaming the media for taking the GOP nominee's remarks ""out of context in order to deceive voters and veterans.""

As quoted in an ABC News report, Flynn said that Trump's comments were ""highlighting the challenges veterans face when returning home after serving their country.""

Marine Staff Sgt. Chad Robichaux, who posed the initial question about mental health services to Trump at the Virginia event, also released a statement saying it was ""sickening that anyone would twist Mr. Trump's comments,"" which he said were ""thoughtful and understanding of the struggles many veterans have.""

""It is true that not everyone can handle traumatic events,"" the Veterans of Foreign Wars said in a statement to ABC News. ""Regarding veterans, we need to treat those who need help and research how two people experiencing the same time and place can be impacted so differently."" "
100304,1004,Trump Used Foundation To Connect With Social Conservatives Ahead Of 2016 Bid,http://talkingpointsmemo.com/livewire/trump-charity-social-conservtiaves,12,"Donald Trump used his private foundation -- funded largely by outsider contributions -- to build relationships with social conservative groups ahead of his 2016 presidential bid, an examination by Real Clear Politics published Tuesday found.

In one case, the Trump Foundation may have violated IRS rules by donating to a not-for-profit allowed to engage in a political activity -- and thus subject to tougher regulations regarding incoming contributions -- as opposed to a traditional charity. The other transactions highlighted by Real Clear Politics reveal a pattern starting in 2011 of Trump speaking at right wing groups' confabs around the same time the Trump Foundation was making donations to their non-profit affiliates, though the RCP report stopped short of alleging an explicit quid pro quo.

“He was politically active starting in 2011,” a source with ties to Trump told RCP, adding that around that time Trump “started to make strategic donations.”

Trump Foundation tax filings between in 2011 and 2014 showed that it donated up at least $286,000 to noteworthy conservative or policy groups, RCP reported. Often times, the contributions were from Trump's foundation to the charity arms of the social conservative groups. However, Trump Foundation tax returns from 2013 show a $10,000 contribution to The Family Leader -- a 501(c)(4) that is allowed to engage in limited political activity and thus receives more scrutiny -- rather than to the group's 501(c)(3) charity affiliate the Family Leader Foundation, according to RCP.

“There’s a mistake somewhere,” Rosemary Fei, a partner at the Adler & Colvin law firm in San Francisco, who specializes in charity law, told RCP. “It might be a really substantive mistake, or it could just be a reporting error or sloppiness. But improper reporting is still a violation of tax law. That’s something the IRS would look at.”

Even in instances where the Trump Foundation probably did not violate charity tax law, the foundation's transactions paint a picture of how Trump made inroads with the social conservative movement -- which had reason to be skeptical of the flashy New York billionaire -- as he laid the ground work for his campaign for the GOP nomination.

The RCP report comes as the Trump Foundation is under investigation by the New York Attorney General's office, which ordered last week that it cease its fundraising activities because it lacked the proper certification to solicit contributions. Trump himself stopped donating to the foundation after 2008, according to tax filings, and its coffers have since been filled outside contributors."
100305,1004,Clinton Slams Trump's Body Shaming: 'You Are More Than The Way You Look',http://talkingpointsmemo.com/livewire/clinton-trump-women-shocking,12,"Hillary Clinton confronted Donald Trump's ""shocking"" comments about women, saying that women need to ""refute"" his remarks.

Her comments during a town hall Tuesday in Haverford, Pennsylvania, came in response to a question from a member of the audience, who noted Trump's comments about women and asked Clinton how to address how much girls struggle with their body image.

""Your right, my opponents has just taken this concern to a new level of difficulty and meanness,"" she said, adding that it's ""shocking"" that Trump judges women ""solely on the basis of physical attributes.""

""My opponent insulted Miss Universe,"" she added, referring to Trump's fat-shaming of Alicia Machado. ""How do you get more acclaimed than that?""

Clinton said that women cannot take Trump's insults seriously.

""We need to laugh at it. We need to refute it,"" she said.

She said that girls are influenced by messages in the media at earlier and earlier ages, and that women need to stand up to bullying.

""You are more than the way you look,"" she said. ""We're not all gonna end up being Miss Universe.”

""Let’s support other women and girls in being proud of who they are,"" she added."
100306,1005,Millennials Voting Third Party: It's Mostly Limited to White People,http://www.motherjones.com/politics/2016/10/third-party-voting-nonwhite-millennials,12,"The Hillary Clinton campaign has been fretting that millennial voters are backing third-party candidates at historic rates and threatening her base of support. But a new survey suggests that she's doing just fine among a large subset of this group: nonwhite young adults, who are much less likely than their white peers to support third-party candidates.

The findings come from the GenForward September 2016 survey, the latest in a series of monthly polls tracking millennials' political attitudes. The survey, which is conducted by the Black Youth Project at the University of Chicago and the Associated Press-NORC Center for Public Affairs Research, is one of the only polls that focuses on the opinions of African American, Asian American, and Hispanic young adults. The poll series began in June and intentionally includes disproportionately large numbers of nonwhite respondents in an effort to provide a clearer picture of how political opinion varies among racial and ethnic groups.

The September poll, which included responses from 1,851 young adults between the ages of 18 and 30—1,279 of whom were nonwhite—found that white millennials support third-party candidates at higher rates than nonwhites do. Gary Johnson, the Libertarian Party candidate, had support from 15 percent of white young adults, but his support was in the single digits among African Americans, Asian Americans, and Latinos. Green Party candidate Jill Stein polled in the single digits across all racial groups.

Overall, among respondents who said they were likely to vote in the election, 12 percent said they would vote for Johnson while 5 percent plan to vote for Stein. Those are far lower numbers than have been shown by other recent polls of millennials, which have included a smaller share of nonwhite respondents. A recent New York Times/CBS News poll found that more than a third of voters between the ages of 18 and 29 backed Johnson or Stein.

""Despite Clinton's struggles with young adults relative to her predecessor, we do not find strong support for the argument that third-party candidates are winning the hearts and minds of Millennials,"" the researchers note. ""Our data suggests that recent reports about Millennials' support for third-party candidates has been overstated, and that the bulk of support for these candidates that does exist is limited to young whites.""

Nonwhite millennials strongly prefer Clinton to Donald Trump. Fifty-five percent of African Americans, 52 percent of Asian Americans, and 43 percent of Latinos say they support Clinton, compared with 1 percent of African Americans, 12 percent of Asian Americans, and 11 percent of Latinos who support Trump. The presidential race is a dead heat among white millennials, with both candidates pulling in 27 percent among that demographic, according to the GenForward survey.

Clinton performs even better among nonwhite young adults who say they are likely to vote in November: 74 percent of African American voters in that group, 71 percent of Asian Americans, and 64 percent of Latinos say they will vote for the Democrat. Support for Trump, who has recently embarked on several minority outreach efforts in an attempt to boost his support among nonwhites, is in the single digits among these groups. Once again, the race is tighter among white young adults, with 41 percent of likely voters saying they will vote for Clinton and 31 percent saying they will vote for Trump.

Even these figures reveal a tough reality for Clinton: Her support from young nonwhite voters is still lower than President Barack Obama's was in 2012, when among young voters he won 91 percent of African Americans, 86 percent of Asian Americans, and 74 percent of Latinos. Clinton's numbers among voters who actually show up to vote may be better than the polling of potential or likely voters suggests. Still, the findings indicate that Clinton's greatest challenge among young nonwhite voters might not come from third parties, but from those who choose to sit out Election Day entirely."
100307,1005,Remember When Trump Said He Was Audited Because He Was a Christian?,http://www.motherjones.com/politics/2016/10/remember-when-trump-said-he-was-audited-because-he-was-christian,12,"Many people say that Donald Trump speaks with no regard for accuracy or consequences. With the recent news that Trump declared a $916 million loss on his 1995 tax returns and possibly exploited a loophole to not pay federal income taxes for 18 years, one of those instances of Trump mouthing off deserves to be reexamined.

During a GOP primary debate in February, Trump claimed that he was not releasing his tax returns because he was being audited by the IRS. Immediately after the slugfest, CNN's Chris Cuomo asked the reality television star on air about this, and Trump replied:

The one problem I have is that I'm always audited by the IRS, which I think is very unfair. I don't know, maybe because of religion, maybe because of something else, maybe because I'm doing this, although this is just recently.

Religion? Trump was being audited because of his religion? Really? Cuomo asked for an explanation: ""What do you mean religion?"" Trump went on:

Well, maybe because of the fact that I'm a strong Christian, and I feel strongly about it and maybe there's a bias.

An incredulous Cuomo pressed the matter: ""You think you can get audited for being a strong Christian?"" And Trump responded, ""Well, you see what's happened. You have many religious groups that are complaining about that. They've been complaining about it for a long time.""

This was some allegation. No major presidential candidate had ever charged that he was being targeted by a federal agency because of his religious beliefs.

Later that evening, CNN's Anderson Cooper pushed Trump on this, asking if he truly thought the IRS was after him because of his Christian beliefs. Trump appeared to backpedal a bit, answering: ""Well, I know they certainly had a lot of problems, I mean, if you look at what's been happening over the years. I don't think, I don't think it applies."" He still insisted he had been unfairly targeted for the audit: ""But I can tell you one thing: I am audited when I shouldn't be audited…Why is it that every single year, I'm audited, whereas other people that are very rich, people are never audited?""

Now the public knows this was merely fact-free posturing. According to the New York Times report—the accuracy of which has not been challenged by Trump or his campaign—the real estate mogul took nearly a $1 billion loss in a move that could have erased his federal income tax obligation for almost the next two decades. So when Trump was playing the Christian card and accusing the IRS of religious bias (without providing a crumb of evidence), he certainly knew that the IRS had plenty of legitimate reasons for giving his tax returns a damn careful review. And even when he backed off this claim, he still moaned that he had been unfairly selected for an audit. Yet due to his billion-dollar scheme, of all American taxpayers (or non-taxpayers), Trump perhaps most deserved auditing.

Trump's statements from February now look absolutely ridiculous—and they are further indication that Trump cannot be trusted to speak truthfully about his taxes and finances.

Watch Trump claim the IRS was after him because of his religious views: "
100308,1005,"Court Slams Mike Pence’s ""Nightmare Speculation"" About Syrian Refugees",http://www.motherjones.com/politics/2016/10/appeals-court-judge-slams-mike-pences-treatment-syrian-refugees,12,"As Mike Pence prepares for the first vice presidential debate on Tuesday, the refugee policy for this Republican governor's home state of Indiana drew a strong rebuke from a conservative federal appeals court. In an opinion issued on Monday, the 7th Circuit Court of Appeals slammed Pence's treatment of Syrian refugees, saying his effort to block their resettlement was based on ""no evidence"" and constituted ""nightmare speculation."" The final decision for the three-member panel was written by Judge Richard Posner, who was appointed by Ronald Reagan. Also on the bench was Judge Diane Sykes, who was appointed by George W. Bush and was recently named by Trump's campaign as a potential Supreme Court nominee.

After the Paris terror attacks last November, Pence was one of 31 governors who opposed the resettlement of Syrian refugees in their respective states. In Indiana, Pence declared that state agencies would no longer cover the cost of some key social services for any refugees whose country of origin was listed as Syria on their refugee documents.

""Indiana has a long tradition of opening our arms and homes to refugees from around the world but, as governor, my first responsibility is to ensure the safety and security of all [Indiana residents],"" Pence said at the time.

A resettlement agency called Exodus Refugee Immigration sued the state, saying its refusal to help resettle Syrian refugees constituted discrimination based on national origin. According to the court document, 174 Syrian refugees were settled in Indiana in the last fiscal year.

In March, a federal judge blocked Pence's order, saying his withholding of state resources ""clearly discriminates against Syrian refugees based on their national origin."" The case was appealed and brought before a panel of three Republican-appointed judges who upheld the injunction.

In his decision, Judge Posner pointed out there have been no known cases of Syrian refugees being arrested or prosecuted for terrorist acts in the United States. In response to Pence's argument that his policy is not based on national origin discrimination but rather on national security concerns, Posner wrote, ""That's the equivalent of his saying (not that he does say) that he wants to forbid black people to settle in Indiana not because they're black but because he's afraid of them, and since race is therefore not his motive he isn't discriminating. But that, of course, would be racial discrimination, just as his targeting Syrian refugees is discrimination on the basis of nationality.""

Attempts to suspend Syrian refugee resettlement in individual states has not fared well so far. Texas and Alabama both filed lawsuits against the federal government over the placement of Syrian refugees in those states. Both cases were dismissed in federal court and have since been appealed.

Since becoming Trump's vice presidential pick, Pence has been a supporter of Trump's proposal to stop accepting Syrian refugees into the country. He told NBC's Meet the Press that the resettlement program ""puts safety and security of the American people second to the agenda of the UN or to liberals in this country.""

One of the judges who oversaw the case was Diane Sykes, who is known for writing a decision restricting women's access to birth control and defending the right of a Christian student group to exclude LGBT people. She is also a potential Supreme Court pick for Donald Trump.

100309,1006,Hillary Clinton didn’t risk “losing a billion” because she produces nothing of value,http://hotair.com/archives/2016/10/04/hillary-clinton-didnt-risk-losing-billion-produces-nothing-value/,12,"The media has given Hillary Clinton a new bone to chew with the likely illegal release of some of Donald Trump’s tax forms and she’s rushing out on the campaign trail to take full advantage of it. (Or at least as close to “rushing” as she can mange, bless her heart.) Given how thin this gruel is, however, her speech on the subject last night came off as one of the weaker attempts at political wit we’ve seen in a season already lacking in pithy retorts. As Politico reports, Clinton decided to make fun of The Donald over the fact that a businessman managed to lose money on a large investment.

Hillary Clinton forcefully — and joyfully — hammered Donald Trump over his business acumen Monday, casting the real estate mogul as a bigger bully than Wells Fargo rather than the “genius” his allies have sought to portray him as…

“Well, then you all know that in the debate he said it was smart to avoid paying taxes. Yesterday, his campaign was bragging it makes him a genius,” she continued. “Here’s my question: What kind of genius loses a billion dollars in a single year? This is Trump to a T. He’s taken corporate excess and made a business model out of it. He abuses his power, games the system, puts his own interests ahead of the country’s. It’s Trump first and everyone else last.”

“Back in the 1990s, Trump apparently lost a billion dollars in a single year on bad investments and failing casinos. Now, how anybody can lose a dollar, let alone a billion dollars, in the casino industry is kinda beyond me, right? It’s just hard to figure.”
Clinton went on to ask different versions of the same mocking question at a couple of stops. How can anyone lose money with a casino? To the credit of Clinton’s team, that’s a pretty good line because it taps into a widely held (though false) belief which is common among Americans. Hey… the house always wins, right? Casinos are money machines. And when the conditions are right that’s certainly true. But when the economy is in trouble, luxury businesses like casinos suffer along with the rest of the economy. If you look at a list of current casinos in Atlantic City you’ll see the remains of a battlefield where more than a half dozen of them closed and another dozen projects were cancelled before completion. This was hardly specific to Donald Trump, but then I wouldn’t expect politicians who don’t engage in actual business deals to know that.

The irony here is that Clinton should be the last person in the world asking how someone could manage to lose money in a business venture. She and her husband have made boatloads of money to be sure, but on what? Unlike actual business owners who have to risk huge investments, create jobs and fight shifting economic conditions, Hillary Clinton has been exclusively in the business of selling the carbon dioxide which she emits from her lungs. She gives speeches, frequently commanding more than a quarter of million dollars to show up someplace for a half hour or so and talk to people who stand to gain nothing from the experience. The only real winners in these deals are the folks who arrange and pay for the appearances because they gain access to the Clinton political machine when they write that big check.

Clinton’s only other source of serious income has been books. She gets massive advances to produce volumes of words which then largely sit on the shelves, selling nowhere near enough copies to justify the expense. (Her latest effort sold less than 3,000 copies in the first week, despite Clinton receiving a $14M advance on the masterpiece.) But this is all that Hillary Clinton has ever had to offer. She’s never risked anything in terms of a business and simply has people hand her massive amounts of money just for being named Hillary Clinton. So yes… Trump has lost some money on business ventures, but that’s because he actually ventured into that world.

And there’s one other point about the money that Trump allegedly lost on these deals, made eloquently by Chuck Woolery:"
100310,1006,Bill Clinton trashes Obamacare on behalf of Hillary; Makes case for single-payer,http://hotair.com/archives/2016/10/04/bill-clinton-trashes-obamacare-behalf-hillary-makes-case-single-payer/,12,"Appearing in Michigan Monday, former President Bill Clinton took aim at the signature legislative “achievement” of the Obama Administration and ripped it to shreds.

For some reason, Hillary Clinton’s top surrogate attacked the disastrous results of Obamacare, and he was spot on: And he kept going: So what’s at play here? Is this Clinton trying to “triangulate” to appeal to undecided voters who are clearly feeling real pain in their wallets as a result of Obamacare?  Maybe a little it. But in this next clip, you’ll see, perhaps, a larger predicate being laid: You see, his arguments go well beyond the obvious failings of the Affordable Care Act, he is attacking the health insurance model employed in the United States to fund health care for the vast majority of Americans. It isn’t Obamacare he is ultimately criticizing, it’s the idea of having any kind of competitive, free market health insurance system.

“The insurance model doesn’t work here,” says the man who introduced a single-payer health care proposal (under the management of his wife, Hillary) back in the 1990’s. Isn’t it ovious he’s making the case to get private health insurance companies out of the business of paying for health care?

Oh sure, when she was running against Bernie Sanders, Hillary claimed single-payer would never happen here in the US, but that was in January. After losing over 20 primaries to the socialist upstart, she added a “public option” to her platform in May.

If they win the election, you’ll be singing “Oh Canada!” on the way to the doctor’s office. "
100311,1006,Yikes: New North Carolina poll has Clinton up … six points,http://hotair.com/archives/2016/10/04/yikes-new-north-carolina-poll-clinton-six-points/,12,"Probably an outlier but worth noting in case it’s picking up a late break towards Clinton in the state. Because if it is, this election’s over. There’s virtually no way Trump wins the presidency if he hands over 15 electoral votes from Romney’s column to Hillary. In fact, if Hillary wins North Carolina and holds the usual blue states, she could win the election even if Trump hits the trifecta of Ohio, Florida, and Pennsylvania. All she’d need is Colorado, Virginia, and New Hampshire — all of which she’s likely to win — plus a narrow victory in Nevada. North Carolina is that important to Trump.

Before you dismiss this as an outlier, note that Elon had Trump by one in North Carolina just a few weeks ago. It picked up his early September surge. Now it’s seeing a major shift towards Clinton.

Clinton’s increase in support comes after she trailed Trump by close to 2 points during the first Elon Poll of the fall, released Sept. 20. Clinton is now the preference of 44.5 percent of voters while 39 percent plan to vote for Trump. Libertarian Gary Johnson has seen an increase in support, with 9 percent planning to vote for him in November compared to 6 percent of those polled earlier last month.

Clinton has retained her support among black voters, with 98 percent planning to vote for her, while benefitting by a widening gender gap in the race. Among those planning to head to the polls in North Carolina next month, 61 percent of female voters plan to voter for Clinton while 56 percent of male voters plan to pick Trump. Two weeks ago, she held a 53-47 advantage over Trump among likely female voters.

Looking at how the two performed in the Sept. 26 debate, 64 percent of those likely voters who watched the debate picked Clinton as the winner.
The best reason to think this is an outlier is Trump’s number. He hasn’t been below 40 percent in an NC poll in nearly a month and hit 45 percent in not one but two polls two weeks ago. He had a bad debate, but 39 percent is a gut punch. The best reason not to think this is an outlier is that Quinnipiac found Clinton up three points in the state just a few days ago (after this Elon poll was conducted, in fact). Three points isn’t much, but it happens to be her biggest lead in NC since early September. And if you account for the “house effects” in various polls tracked by FiveThirtyEight, a three-point Democratic lead in Quinnipiac is tantamount to a five-point lead in other polls — nearly matching what Elon found in this new one. It really may be that Hillary has opened a bit of a cushion in North Carolina. And if it is, that’s likely the most alarming poll for Republicans since the debates.

When I tweeted the results earlier, a Twitter pal noted that the sample here seems far-fetched. The 2012 exit poll of NC recorded a 39/33 split for Democrats; today’s Elon poll found a 44D/33R split in party registrations. That’s obviously too blue, right? Well, Elon also asked everyone polled how they currently identify politically, irrespective of their registration. That split was a smaller Democratic tilt at 36D/29R, although still slightly ahead of 2012’s Dem advantage. By comparison, the recent Selzer poll of North Carolina had a narrow partisan gap of 33D/30R producing a lead for Hillary overall of just one point. It seems as though Elon’s anticipating a bluer electorate than Selzer is. But before you write the poll off, do note: A few weeks ago when Elon had Trump ahead in NC by a point, it used a similar sample of 41D/32R by party registration and 36D/26R by party identification. If anything, their sample has gotten slightly redder over the last few weeks — and yet Hillary’s still gained seven points on Trump in that time. Not a good trendline.

According to FiveThirtyEight, Clinton’s presently a 57 percent favorite to win the state. Nationally she’s a 73 percent favorite to win the election; back on September 26th, the day of the debate, her odds had sunk to nearly even at 55/45. Big stakes for Trump on Sunday, needless to say."

On top of being supremely uninteresting, he also catches a lot of flak for his inconsistency on abortion.

It’s something the voters who attended tonight’s VP debate cared enough about to protest. Here’s Cortney O’Brien with more…

From Townhall: On my way into Longwood University for Tuesday night’s one and only vice presidential debate, I spotted a protester wearing an anti-Tim Kaine shirt targeting the Virginia senator’s abortion record. AWashington Times reporter also foundCatholic protesters who traveled several miles to tell Kaine he’s giving their faith a bad name.

“He says he’s a devout Catholic, but he’s not. He is 100 percent pro-abortion,” she said. “The lie that he perpetuates that ‘I’m personally against it.’ That is a lie because if you are against it you don’t vote for it 100 percent of the time.”


Kaine, who identifies as Catholic, has frustrated many voters by recently flip floppingon the Hyde Amendment. The law, which just turned 40, prohibits taxpayer funds from going toward abortion. Kaine had been in favor of the amendment for years and says he’s “personally opposed” to abortion, yet after becoming Hillary Clinton’s running mate, he seemed to fall more in line with her pro-abortion agenda.

You either think stopping a heartbeat and sucking a viable baby out of the womb with a vacuum is murder or you don’t Tim.

This isn’t one of those “nuanced” issues where you can pretend that your personal opinion doesn’t matter.

If you’re OK with it, then just own it. Don’t run around acting like voting for something doesn’t mean you like it.

The Democrats firmly believe there should be no restrictions on abortion.

Which means that abortion is totally cool all the way up until the delivery date even if the child could survive outside the womb.

That’s horrifying.

Will the moderator even ask about it?

Doubt it. "
100315,1008,President Hillary Won’t Stop a Nuclear-Armed Iran,http://www.americanthinker.com/articles/2016/10/president_hillary_wont_stop_a_nucleararmed_iran_.html,12,"Hillary Clinton has been running as the status quo U.S. presidential candidate while Donald Trump has been running as the candidate of change. Neither the United States, Israel, nor the rest of the Middle East can afford what will amount to a third term of Obama’s failed foreign policy. Particularly the continued implementation of the disastrous Iranian nuclear deal.

The facts show that on Hillary Clinton’s watch as Obama’s Secretary of State she initiated the Iran deal, embraced it fully when it was signed, and has been a silent cheerleader ever since. This in spite of the warning signs of an emboldened and cheating Iran.

Under Hillary’s watch as president there is high probability, based on her poor judgment and weakness as Secretary of State, that when Iran attempts to finally acquire a nuclear weapon, which they will surely do, she will not take any military action to deter it. Although the U.S. may impose unilateral sanctions, in the end, her efforts will fail to dissuade Iran to give up its program just as the U.S. failed to stop North Korea after her husband Bill Clinton signed a similar nuclear deal as president. Consequently, for the first time in history, a jihadist Islamic state, which has been publicly declaring for years, their willingness to wipe the Jewish state off the map and be destroyed for the sake of Allah, will possess the bomb.

As the Wall Street Journal (WSJ) reported on September 8, 2015, Hillary Clinton in her last six months as Secretary of State helped open the door to a dramatic shift in US policy towards Iran by suggesting that the US will concede to let Iran continue enriching Uranium at small levels in order to convince, a bankrupt and internationally isolated Iran, to hold negotiations with the Obama Administration. In July 2012, Mrs. Clinton ‘s closest policy aide, Jake Sullivan, was the first one to meet in secret with Iranians diplomats in Oman, with many meetings to follow, while Holocaust denier President Ahmadinejad was still in power. As Mr. Sullivan, who now serves as Mrs. Clinton’s top presidential campaign advisor, said “she recognized the difficulty of reaching a solution, with zero enrichment”. Mrs. Clinton left the state department in early 2013 and later that year, the Obama administration agreed publicly that Iran could continue to enrich Uranium.

When the Iran deal was signed, she endorsed it fully as “an important step in putting a lid on Iran’s nuclear program,” and “the most effective path... to prevent Iran from acquiring a nuclear weapon.”

However, in reality the deal does not derail or abolish Iran’s quest for the bomb, but merely slows it down, and in less than 10 years the deal makes it legal for Iran to acquire a nuclear weapon.

But in the meantime, it fundamentally unraveled the global sanctions regime against Iran, and no one except the U.S. will ever try to bring it back. Iran has been infused with multiple billion dollars’ trade and military deals with Russia, China, and Europe. This is in addition to $150 billion dollars paid to them by the U.S., including $1.7 billion in cold cash from the U.S., paid as ransom for the release of four American hostages, which in all likelihood will be used to fund terrorism. In addition, the WSJ just reported that on the same day Iran released the American hostages, Obama agreed in secret to remove UN and EU sanctions emplaced eight years earlier on Iran’s main missile financing banks. Iran has conducted up to 10 ballistic missiles tests since the forging of the nuclear agreement in July 2015.

Moreover, now that they have more financial resources and international breathing room to expand their influence in the Shiite world, and increase military interventio and terrorism in the Middle East, Asia, and Latin America in order to build an anti-American, anti-Israeli and anti-Sunni axis  

Hillary has repeatedly stated that the agreement “will have to be enforced vigorously, relentlessly"", but in reality the Iranians have already broken the agreement and she and the administration appear to have chosen silence.

According to the German intelligence agency’s annual report issued in July, Iran has been cheating and has a “clandestine” effort to seek illicit nuclear technology and equipment from German companies at what is, even by international standards, a quantitatively high level.” Moreover, German Chancellor Angela Merkel said that “Iran continued unabated to develop its rocket program in conflict with the relevant provisions of the UN Security Council.” 

When Hillary stated in 2015 that she will not hesitate to take military action if Iran attempts to obtain a nuclear weapon, she was bluffing or lying in order to assuage Jewish-American voters’ concerns. Any honest assessment of Clinton’s tenure in office would conclude that she was among the weakest secretaries of state, undermining and deserting allies and protecting and appeasing enemies.

After the success of General David Petraeus’ military “surge” in Iraq defeated the terrorists there, as Secretary of State she supported Obama’s decision in 2011 to withdraw all U.S. troops from Iraq, without keeping a small force behind as the generals recommended Obama to do. This created a power vacuum which ISIS took advantage of to form, flourish, and expand.

Secretary Clinton assured us for months that Assad was a “reformer”, and supported Obama’s decision not to attack or remove Assad even when he crossed the red line by using chemical weapons against his own civilian population. She delayed and postponed providing arms and aid to the anti-Assad Syrian rebels, until ISIS spread to Syria too. Because of her misjudgment, she left a human catastrophe of 500,000 dead Syrians and millions of refugees streaming into Syria’s neighbors and Europe. She supported bringing Russia back to the Middle East and Syria to supposedly fight ISIS which only helped to sustain Assad, its patron Iran, and therefore the civil war.

She was in favor of U.S. intervention in Libya and Egypt, undermining governments that were no threat to American interests which led to Islamic jihadists’ taking over in those nations. In Libya, this resulted in the murder of the American ambassador and the flourishing of ISIS.

It is true that president Obama has made his own foreign policy, but Hillary Clinton had the option of resigning if she did not agree with it but in reality she shares Obama’s central vision and judgment about the Middle East and the success of the Iran deal.

If Hillary is elected, almost certainly she will continue Obama’s kowtowing to the Iranians and facilitate any further concessions they may request instead of confronting their lies and ambitions of regional aggression and hegemony.

If Trump is elected, a change from the disastrous past eight years is likely. Even though there is no certainty of Trump’s actions as president, it seems that he possesses a better sense of judgment and the willingness to change America’s ongoing downhill course. Trump has consistently been against the signing of the Iran deal and campaigned against it, at the time saying “I never seen something so incompetently negotiated,” suggesting that he will re- negotiate it if elected. He has also been publicly critical of Obama’s weakness and silence regarding a newly strengthened Iran.

A Trump presidency is the only thing that will restore deterrence and American leadership in the world while protecting its allies and confronting evil.

100316,1008,The Intellectual Case for Donald Trump,http://www.americanthinker.com/articles/2016/10/the_intellectual_case_for_donald_trump.html,12,"Right-wing wunderkind Ross Douthat has recently claimed that all ""intellectual"" arguments for Trump fail because of the man's ungovernable personality and temperament.  We have no idea what he really believes, or what he might do, cerebral and academic apologia to the contrary.

May I suggest a few daring points in response?  Trump is not nearly as unpredictable as some of his opponents (and apologists) claim, and a basic overall consistency can be detected in his history.  That being said, he is not an expert in policy matters, but that needn't worry us because he will have a good team advising him.  Finally, as a salesman (not an administrator, though clearly already a consummate politician), his current policies and even his personal presentation must be understood as part of an ongoing pitch, not as a settled set of proposals.

First, his basic consistency: Trump was once a Democrat at a time when the ""conservative Democrat"" was not such an endangered species, but his consideration of a presidential run for the Reform Party in the year 2000 proves that he held the same convictions about national policy as he holds now.  (The Reform Party's actual candidate in 2000 was former Republican candidate Pat Buchanan, who has dubbed Trump his political successor.)

What is more interesting than his Democratic past is the Democratic present.  In the first debate, Hillary Clinton barely went after Trump's policies, instead attacking him for not paying income tax (despite this being perfectly legal if one uses the loopholes shrewdly) and for profiting off the 2008 housing crisis.  (A recent Oscar-winning movie, The Big Short, celebrated several analysts who also made money off the meltdown, and no one seems to have taken a moral issue with them.)  Part of this is because many of Trump's more controversial policies are also her policies: she, too, favors punishing foreign countries that engage in currency manipulation with tariffs, and not only does she also want to increase border security, but she actually voted for a wall along the border of the U.S. and Mexico in 2006.  Yet Trump presents his own espousal of these policies in his typical excessive style, and since Clinton is building her case against him primarily on his personality, she is forced to keep her agreement with him on these points a secret – thus ceding these positions to him in the public forum.  It is hard not to see a salesman's intuitive artistry in Trump's strategy here.

And if that's the case, it suggests that – to some extent – the mercurial, extremist Trump we see on stage is something of an act.  Slavoj _i_ek has suggested that Trump's offensive style is a way of concealing how moderate and reasonable he really is.  But it is also part of his current strategy of negotiating, the art of war combined with the art of the deal.  Because the public is frustrated and angry, he matches their feelings as part of his ""pitch"" – ""pacing,"" as Scott Adams put it.  Like any effective salesman, he is ""pitching"" his policies, but he is in the process of negotiating them, based not so much on public reaction as on the qualified feedback he receives.

Consider his tax policy, the only noteworthy thing Clinton went after him for during the debate.  Yes, some independent studies said his policy would greatly increase the debt (though the same studies Clinton's fact-checkers cited contradicted her claim that her own policies wouldn't add ""a dime"" to the debt), but he has revised his tax policy since the campaign began, and I expect that it will be revised again.  Already such luminaries as Arthur Laffer, founder of supply-side economics, and Lawrence Kudlow have offered Trump advice on his economic policies.  Now, getting guys like those to volunteer their help looks a lot like he's operating from a position of strength.  His economic policies are, we could say, in the ""negotiation"" stages.  In the same way, his policy on illegal aliens always allowed for a policy of ""touchback,"" and his supposed flip-flop on amnesty is therefore more of him gently ""altering the deal.""

And this brings us to maybe the most important point: no, Trump is not a policy expert, but he doesn't really need to be.  As fellow New York icon Tom Wolfe observed, high intelligence is not necessary to be an effective president.  Given how complex the world is now, almost no one can be the kind of technocratic expert we seem to want our president to be.  Gary Johnson consistently proves he is not this kind of expert, and while Hillary Clinton may fit the bill (i.e., she may be the most ""qualified""), given the way the world looks right now, how she has run the machine does not make her experience look like an asset.

Trump, on the other hand, for all his self-aggrandizement, is perfectly aware of his limitations.  In his book Crippled America, he explains how he will solve the health care problem in America: he will lock the nation's top experts on the subject in a room together and not let them out until they figure something out.

At first, this sounds outrageous and risible, but give it a moment's reflection: wouldn't you prefer a president who governs based on what the experts decide rather than his own agenda?

This raises a point about Trump's style not often observed: as aggressive as he is to his enemies, he has a habit of reaching out to them for his projects, perhaps realizing the advantage of a corrective or complementary point of view.  As much as he may disown Trump now, Tony Schwartz, ghostwriter of The Art of the Deal, reveals that Trump approached him after reading a negative article that Schwartz had written about him.  But this is consistent with Trump's style.  When he was going to build golf courses in Florida, environmentalist Ed Russo was vocal in opposing him.  Trump approached Russo and actually put him in charge of the environmental work on the courses.  Russo has since written a book lauding Trump as an environmentalist.  And it is fascinating that his recently released list of Catholic advisers includes figures like John Klink, former president of the International Catholic Migration Commission and someone who has a long record of advocacy for migrants and refugees of all religions.  Will Klink's presence influence Trump's rhetoric or policy on refugees?

We'll see, but for now it is important to remember that, reportedly, Trump wants his V.P. to be in charge of most domestic and foreign policy, and while he wanted to offer the job to Chris Christie, he ended up going with Mike Pence based on his advisers' counsel.  This, if true, refutes the stereotype of him as bullheaded and unreasonable.  This doesn't mean Trump is an ideological vacuum, but rather that he has basically sound conservative instincts and a talent for recruiting competent people, even his critics, to come up with the best policies that are consistent with them.

This, Mr. Douthat, is the intellectual case for Donald Trump.  We'll see if time bears it out.

100317,1008,"What’s Scary, Scarier, and Scariest about Hillary",http://www.americanthinker.com/articles/2016/10/whats_scary_scarier_and_scariest_about_hillary.html,12,"It’s not good to get into personal appearances especially when, like me, you live in a glass house.  But I believe what Brit Hume was hinting at in regard to Hillary’s appearance the other night was that she was so made up and rigidly coiffed she could have been prepared for the debate by Don Corleone’s undertaker Amerigo.  Scary, like one of those creepy clown dolls which move from the couch to the chair when the lights go off is scary.

But scarier is her pledge to create five million new jobs.  Because she doesn’t mean what it sounds like she means.  Hillary Clinton is not going invent a new industry like computers and produce her five million jobs that way.  She’s not going to found a new Internet business like Jeff Bezos or a new retail chain like Sam Walton.  She doesn’t have the I.Q., training or motivation for anything like that.

Instead what she’s talking about is:  (A) creating new government jobs; or (B) creating new jobs with lobbyists and influence peddlers, the Public-Private-Partnership grifters who fund her political machine.  Guys whose sons and daughters run companies who insist they can make jet fuel out of algae or better knock-off Chinese solar panels if only they get stuffed with enough Federal cash.

In other words, bad jobs.  Jobs which, whether in government or in corrupt private entities, consume wealth rather than create it.  Indeed, they will wolf taxpayer money down to no purpose like contestants at a Coney Island hot dog eating contest.  And just as bad money drives out good in Gresham’s law, bad jobs drive out many times their number of good jobs in what we can call the Liberal Law Of Creative Job Destruction. 

It’s not a joke.  One of the clearest examples of how certain types of jobs drive out other more valuable jobs is in public schooling.  Teaching the young how to read, write and sum isn’t rocket science.  It isn’t even model airplane science.  Nor does it take a lot of manpower.  But the layering on with new government jobs year after year; school psychologists, nurses, “professional” unionized custodians, assistant teachers, grievance counselors, teacher aides, curriculum specialists and junior teachers, playground monitors, security guards, nutritionists and in some cases more administrators than classroom teachers has meant that spiraling school taxes have helped drive something like two million manufacturing jobs out of my state and into oblivion.  It’s also why something like forty percent of the houses in my neck of the woods are for sale. 

A process that only goes on.  For example not so long ago I remember an official in a nursing union testifying before Congress that Obamacare would produce 25,000 “new” nursing jobs in California alone.  But when asked how many other jobs the oppressive new regulatory regime would at the same time eliminate in California, she refused to answer.

Because in the computation of a Left Wing Liberal, the massive job killing consequences of their “new jobs” don’t count. 

But it actually does -- big-time, so when Hillary says she has plans for five million new jobs, more jobs than there are people in many States, you cannot, cannot and cannot, be certain the nation will survive the experience.  Because with a hundred million already out of the work force there may not be a single solitary good job left anywhere to support us or your aged Nanny when she finishes creating her five million moon children. 

While what you can be sure of is that as bad things happen, nothing will be Hillary Clinton’s fault.  It will be the “rich” (the other rich -- not her friends the super-rich and Hollywood rich)  or maybe America’s “systemic racism” which will be to blame, the fact that Congress wouldn’t pass a family leave act or raise the minimum wage to a hundred dollars an hour, the refusal of Republicans to “prioritize our inner city schools” or offer trans-gender bathrooms.  Not to mention the blame she will heap on The Little Sisters Of The Poor who year after year stubbornly insist upon caring for the abandoned instead of promoting abortion.

In fact, Hillary Clinton will blame anybody and anything for the disaster she will produce, except her own corruption, incompetence and deceit.

And so winding down, we have scary Hillary the clown and the scarier Hillary the jobs creator but the really, really scary aspect of Hillary Clinton, the scariest thing about her is another thing entirely.  It’s the spell she casts.  Something I’m immune to, I guess, because I go to church every week and eat enough garlic or more likely because I’m already under the spell of the wild Irish girl I married fifty years ago who likes to remind me that while St. Bridget may have given away her father’s sword to a mendicant beggar a thousand three hundred years ago, she never let go of her own.

But in any event, so many people are not so immune and it’s a fact that even face-to-face with the economic end-of-times, that huffing and puffing little Arkansas tugboat will tow into port millions and millions of our fellow citizens who will continue to believe every word out of that lying mouth.

Kind of like how You-Know-Who insisted upon believing Mrs. You-Know-Who about that fruit.

And no, I’m not talking about Barack Obama.

100318,1009,VICE PRESIDENTIAL DEBATE SHOWS WHAT MIGHT HAVE BEEN,http://www.powerlineblog.com/archives/2016/10/vice-presidential-debate-shows-what-might-have-been.php,12,"There were really two debates tonight during the Kaine-Pence encounter. The first was a policy debate in which the key questions were whether, on a range of issues, Obama administration is a success and whether there’s a need for major change. The second was a debate over the merits of Donald Trump and, more particularly, whether a wide range of statements by Trump can be defended.

Mike Pence won the first debate, in my opinion. He did so despite being repeatedly interrupted by Tim Kaine — interruptions that moderator Elaine Quinjano permitted until well into the debate.

Pence won this portion of the debate by taking conservative positions and explaining them well. At times, this meant taking positions I haven’t heard Trump take and that, in cases, seemed inconsistent with Trump’s stance (though I’d have to check to be sure about this).

As for Kaine’s interruptions, they actually ended up helping Pence because the Indiana man refused to be ruffled. The electorate apparently did not mind Joe Biden’s interruptions of Paul Ryan four years ago. But Biden, the sitting vice president was well known and (for some reason) liked by Americans going into the debate.

Kaine is not well known. He did his ticket no favors by introducing himself with such a rude, smug, and downright obnoxious performance.

The policy-oriented debate would have been the only one that mattered had the Republicans nominated any number of qualified conservative Republican candidates. But because they nominated Donald Trump — a non-conservative and a Republican only for sake of convenience — the second debate mattered too.

Kaine won that debate. Kaine repeatedly made statements like “I can’t imagine how Gov. Pence can defend” statement X or position Y of Donald Trump. Pence typically responded that he would be happy to defend the statement or the position, but rarely did so. Most of the time, he either shook his head or said “nonsense.”

In fairness to Pence, some of the statements and positions Kaine called on Pence to defend are indefensible. Nor would it have been a good strategy for Pence to play lots of defense.

Pence needed short, crisp answers to at least some of the charges (it wasn’t necessary answer them all). He actually had some, but stumbled at times to get them out.

On calling Mexicans rapists, it wasn’t until the second or third time the statement came up that Pence finally reminded us that rapists have entered the country illegally from Mexico and that Trump also said that Mexicans were good people. On the New York Times tax story, Pence seemed to take forever to use his best line of response: Trump took a deduction he was entitled to take; do you (Sen. Kaine) take the deductions the law entitles you to take?

The failure by Pence to refute most of Kaine’s charges and his less than effective answers to others prevented tonight from being a big win for Trump-Pence. Yes, Pence won, but I doubt that this debate will move the needle. And let’s not rule out the possibility that Trump will rapidly undo Pence’s good work with a barrage of ridiculous and/or offensive tweets.

Ah, what might have been."
100319,1009,FREE SPEECH PREVAILS AT THE UNIVERSITY OF MINNESOTA,http://www.powerlineblog.com/archives/2016/10/free-speech-prevails-at-the-university-of-minnesota.php,12,"Each year, dozens of student groups at the University of Minnesota are invited to paint small murals in designated spaces on the Washington Avenue Bridge, which unites the northern and southern parts of the campus. The college Republicans painted three small sections that included “Trump/Pence 2016” and “Build the Wall.” The horror! Left-wing students couldn’t bear the sight of Donald Trump and the wall, so they painted the words “Stop white supremacy” across two of the college Republicans’ panels: University President Eric Kaler released a statement that appropriately defended free speech:

The panel includes the phrase from Donald Trump’s presidential campaign, “Build the wall.” While this is protected as free, political speech, we have heard from members of our community who find the phrase hurtful, offensive, anti-immigrant, and anti-Latinx.

People in our community may disagree with the sentiment expressed. However, while the University values free speech, the subsequent vandalism of the panel is not the way to advance a conversation.
***
We encourage all who find some protected speech distasteful or offensive to engage in more protected speech.

A member of a “a Latino-based multicultural fraternity” expressed the usual confusions:

There’s freedom of speech but then there’s hate speech.

Sorry, no. That isn’t how it works.

I was really angry, angry because it’s an attack to my people because I am Mexican.

Why is it an attack on Mexicans to say that if they want to enter the United States, they should do so legally? Does this student think that Mexicans have the right to wander wherever they want, regardless of other countries’ laws? If so, is that a right that is shared by others, or is it unique to Mexicans? If the former, why does Mexico have immigration laws?

Happily, the college Republicans had a more intelligent response to the episode:

We find it highly disturbing that someone would vandalize a simple statement such as “build the wall.”

We have received comments on the painting, falsely accusing us of being racist, xenophobic, and anti-immigrant. Our party’s nominee supports building a wall on the Mexican border to stop the flow of illegal immigrants into this country. We understand that some students may disagree with this policy position. However, free speech is at the center of a functioning democracy, and the actions taken against our panels run contrary to free speech. It’s worth noting that numerous politicians from both parties support building a wall on the Mexican border.

President Obama, Vice-President Biden, Secretary Clinton, and Minnesota Governor Dayton have all supported building a wall on the Mexican border while they were U.S. Senators (Secure Fence Act of 2006). We look forward to students writing angry letters and reporting these Democrat politicians to the Bias Incident System for hurting their feelings as well.

Regardless of how one feels about border security or Mr. Donald J. Trump, it is never acceptable to infringe on other people’s freedom of speech. University policy clearly states, “Any alteration(s) to any panel by any person(s) outside of these designated time(s) is considered vandalism and subject to University Policy and/or local, state and federal laws.”

We appreciate President Kaler’s statement of support for our freedom of speech and we expect the university to continue to uphold their commitment to freedom of speech and diversity of thought.

When it comes to free speech, the University of Minnesota has gotten better over the years. One of the early forays into activism by Scott Johnson and me, quite a few years ago, involved the University of Minnesota. It arose out of the annual activities fair, where student groups have booths and hand out literature. Left-wing student monitors confiscated literature that was being handed out by the college Republicans, who then wrote a letter of complaint to the dean of students.

Peter Swanson, who led the college Republicans and wrote the letter, naturally assumed that the left-wingers had acted in violation of university policies, and wanted to ensure that such infringement didn’t occur in the future. He was surprised to receive, in response, a letter from the dean agreeing with the left-wing students’ actions. She said, in essence, that the University of Minnesota is committed to diversity, and as a result there is no room there for Republicans.

Scott and I represented Peter and the college Republicans. In response to our threat of a lawsuit, the university made significant concessions, including an agreement to subject the president of the university and his cabinet to First Amendment sensitivity training.

Happily, the University’s current president seems already to be sensitive to the right of free speech."
100320,1009,REVIVING RELIGIOUS TESTS FOR PUBLIC OFFICE,http://www.powerlineblog.com/archives/2016/10/reviving-religious-tests-for-public-office.php,12,"Article VI of the Constitution contains the clause that reads, “no religious Test shall ever be required as a Qualification to any Office or public Trust under the United States.” This is was the first time that any nation had explicitly rejected religious discrimination (Britain under the Toleration Act still maintained numerous religious tests to be a member of the government.)

Apparently Leo DiCaprio wishes to junk this provision of the Constitution. From The Hill:

Politicians who don’t believe in climate change should not hold public office, said actor Leonardo DiCaprio Monday at the White House before the screening of his new climate documentary. . .

“If you do not believe in climate change, you do not believe in facts, or in science or empirical truths and therefore, in my humble opinion, should not be allowed to hold public office.”

It is fitting that DiCaprio phrases the matter in terms of “belief.” Reminds me of the story about the late Julian Simon:

Simon once posed a question at an environmental forum: “How many people here believe that the earth is increasingly polluted and that our natural resources are being exhausted?” Almost every hand shot up. He then said, “Is there any evidence that could dissuade you?” There was no response, so he asked again, “Is there any evidence I could give you—anything at all—that would lead you to reconsider these assumptions?” Again, no response. Simon concluded, “Well, excuse me. I’m not dressed for church.”

Stephen Green asks: “I’m curious to know how much denial it takes to fill up the gas tank of a private jet.”"
100321,1010,Veterans are not happy about Donald Trump’s ‘callous’ PTSD comments,https://thinkprogress.org/veteran-on-trumps-ptsd-comments-just-one-chapter-in-a-long-story-of-disrespect-2477fdd605d8#.o49gp5yol,12,"In a bid to recover from a disastrous campaign week, Republican nominee for president Donald Trump made a brief stop on Monday to address veterans at a town hall in Herndon, Virginia.
But while answering a question about veteran health care, he made an offhand comment saying that “strong” veterans don’t deal with PTSD.
“When you talk about the mental health problems, when people come back from war and combat and they see things that maybe a lot of the folks in the room have seen many times over, and you’re strong and you can handle it, but a lot of people can’t handle it,” he said.
Trump’s cavalier assumption quickly drew widespread scorn. Many veterans, in particular, were incensed_—_saying that Trump’s comments are just the latest in a long line of disrespectful comments toward America’s military and military families, and only serve to show how out of touch he is with their community’s needs, despite his outward professions of support. “When I first saw those comments, I was shocked and yet not surprised at the same time,” Will Fischer, the executive director of the Union Veteran’s Council (AFL-CIO), told ThinkProgress over the phone.
Fischer, who said he had “the impeccable timing of graduating boot camp August the 17th of 2001,” is a Marine and Purple Heart recipient who served in the Iraq War, and is now an outspoken advocate for veterans.
“It shows a remarkably high level of disengagement with veterans and military families to say something like that,” said Fischer. “But at the same time I was not surprised at all. You have to realize, this is Donald Trump we’re talking about… someone who seems to spend all of their time when talking about veterans, military families, and foreign policy attacking our military, insulting veterans, and alienating our allies.” Fischer isn’t alone in his ire at Trump’s comments. Joe Biden, whose late son Beau served in Iraq, went off on Trump in a fiery speech at a Hillary Clinton rally in Florida. And Ricardo Gutierrez, a U.S. Navy veteran who has written an open letter decrying Trump’s rhetoric, said in a statement: “Not only is it incredibly arrogant for a man who has never seen combat to make statements like this, but it’s also incredibly damaging and inaccurate as well. Thousands of veterans end up not seeking the help they need because of stereotypes and societal pressures like this.” Paul Rieckoff, the CEO and founder of Iran and Afghanistan Veterans of America (IAVA), told The Hollywood Reporter that Trump’s comments perpetuate a dangerous stigma.
“When people in power use terms like ‘killing yourself’ and ‘mental problems,’ it perpetuates the stigma, it compounds the impression that these veterans are broken, and it can discourage them from seeking help,” said Rieckhoff. “And also, he assumed that no one in the audience has PTSD, which is a really unlikely assumption in a room full of war veterans.”
In response to the backlash, the Trump campaign argued that his comments had been taken out of context, and were being twisted as part of a “propaganda arm.” The campaign has sought to defend his comments by pointing to the policy recommendations he made in the speech_—_which largely called for vouchers and the privatization of veteran’s mental health care. Fischer, however, was unconvinced by the rebuttal. He argues that not only do Trump’s comments reveal his deep-seated and misguided stigmas about mental illness, but also that Trump’s policy proposals are just as bad for veterans as his careless words.
“This is someone who embraces very little policy when it comes to veterans and military families_—_but when he actually does embrace specific policies, it’s things like doing away with the GI bill, destroying and privatizing the VA,” he said. “What we need to be working towards is having a fully funded and fully staffed VA, not a privatized VA, not sending veterans off to fend for themselves and line the pockets of millionaire and billionaire hospital executives.” Despite reaching out to veterans and claiming to have “tremendous” support, Trump has a long history of making offensive and out-of-touch statements about veterans and military families.
Last July, Trump_—_who received five deferments from the draft to avoid service in Vietnam_—_attacked Vietnam POW Sen. John McCain (R-AZ), saying that he didn’t deserve his status as a war hero because he was captured. After the Democratic Convention, Trump and his campaign went on a week-long smear campaign against the Khans, a Gold Star family that lost their son to the war in Iraq. And, in August, Trump again drew ire from veterans for flaunting a Purple Heart given to him by a veteran, saying it was “much easier” than actually serving in a war.
“Today’s comments are just one chapter in the long story of Donald Trump’s disrespect towards veterans and military families,” said Fischer. “This wasn’t a one-off.” Another point likely to drive a wedge between Trump and veterans is a key implication of the New York Times’ discovery of Trump’s 1995 tax returns, which show that Trump could have avoided paying federal taxes for nearly the last 20 years. While the campaign hasn’t directly responded to the allegations, Trump said during the first presidential debate that not paying taxes makes him “smart.”
However, the two decades during which Trump may not have paid taxes also encompasses the time after 9/11, when America was fighting two costly wars.
“Not one cent towards our defense, towards equipment like body armor for active duty combat troops, nothing for veterans health care and the VA. He has contributed nothing but calls for more war,” said Fischer.
Trump could, of course, disprove this allegation by releasing his tax returns."
100322,1010,The Trump campaign doesn’t care about dads,https://thinkprogress.org/trump-fathers-7646a573f8f9#.oj931slrn,12,"Ivanka Trump has now followed up her policy role in her father’s presidential campaign with an ad touting the proposals she crafted for him.
“The most important job any woman can have is being a mother,” the ad starts out, before making promises that Donald Trump will enact tax benefits for child care and paid maternity leave. There is no shortage of irony in Republicans declaring motherhood the most important role: the party has historically only agreed with that sentiment when the woman in question is well-off. When poor mothers were thought to be relying on welfare benefits to stay home with their children, they were called “welfare queens,” and legislation was enacted to push them into paid work. Some states still have policies in place meant to limit how many children lower-income women have.
But what the ad really demonstrates is just how little Donald Trump’s campaign for the White House cares about fathers.
Aside from Trump himself, Dads are almost invisible in Ivanka’s ad spot. Two men who may be parents appear briefly, but mostly it’s women she’s focused on. “My father will change outdated labor laws so they support women and American families,” she says, as if children only ever have one female parent.
Fathers are invisible in the Trump policy proposals, too. Last month he released a proposal to guarantee six weeks of paid maternity leave for birth mothers, the first paid-leave plan ever put forward by a Republican presidential nominee. But fathers, as well as adoptive parents, would be completely left out. Men would still only be guaranteed 12 weeks of unpaid leave, and only then if they’re in the 60 percent of Americans who actually qualify. Otherwise, they might get no time off work to spend with their infant child.
Similar themes crop up in his childcare plan, which would allow families that earn $500,000 or less to deduct the cost of childcare from their taxes. He clearly has women in mind, even though a parent of any gender could take advantage of the tax deduction. “Having employed and empowered thousands of women at every level throughout his entire career, Donald Trump understands the needs of the modern workforce,” the campaign said in a fact sheet outlining his proposal. In laying out the case for it, the campaign rattles off statistics about working mothers.
Ignoring fathers in policy design can actually hurt the women Ivanka says her father is trying to help. When generous benefits, such as long maternity leaves, are mandated for women and not men, studies have found that they hurt women’s employment and pay. Employers may see all women as potential mothers and therefore costly investments, but not worry about men if fathers aren’t also covered.
On the flip side, when men are offered paid leave, they are more likely to take time off when a new child arrives, which has been found to boost women’s employment and incomes.
Failing to include dads in a paid-leave plan also demeans the role of fatherhood and ignores the needs of today’s working men. In one study, two-thirds of fathers said they want to split child rearing equally with their partners. Yet it’s hard for them to pull it off: less than a third said that’s how things worked in reality. About 45 percent of today’s fathers say they spend too little time with their children_—_double the share of mothers who feel the same way.
Women are still doing the bulk of the work at home, taking time out of their careers at higher rates to care for family members and spending much more time every week doing those household tasks. But leaving men out of the conversation and ignoring the increasing role fathers want to play only makes the situation worse. "
100323,1010,Mike Pence blames Hillary Clinton for Iraq policy created by Bush and supported by Trump,https://thinkprogress.org/mike-pence-blames-hillary-clinton-for-iraq-policy-created-by-bush-and-supported-by-trump-5c41ce063230#.iwtnskvj1,12,"In Tuesday’s vice presidential debate, Indiana Gov. Mike Pence (R) accused Hillary Clinton of failing to keep enough U.S. soldiers in Iraq to maintain stability in the war-torn nation.
“Iraq has been overrun by ISIS because Hillary Clinton failed to renegotiate a status of forces agreement,” Pence said. “And we removed all our troops from Iraq.”
Yet the 2011 deadline for pulling U.S. troops out of Iraq was negotiated and signed by President George W. Bush in 2008. President Obama, and his Secretary of State Hillary Clinton, inherited that plan.
Notably, Clinton warned in March 2008 that too quick a withdrawal of troops could be problematic, telling the Council on Foreign Relations, that “we cannot allow Iraq to become a breeding ground and safe haven for terrorists,” and that her plan “will not mean retreating from fighting terrorism in Iraq.”
Meanwhile, Donald Trump was among the most vocal supporters at the time for immediate troop withdrawal. In 2006, Trump told CNBC that the U.S. should simply declare “Victory! Tremendous!” and withdraw from Iraq immediately, and “let them have their civil war.”
“I would like to see President Bush get us out of Iraq, which is a total mess, a total catastrophe, and it’s not going to get any better. It’s only going to get worse. It’s a mess,” he said. “What you have to do is get out of Iraq. You can do it nicely. You can do it slowly. You can do it radically.” The following year, Trump said on CNN that the way to get U.S troops out of Iraq was simple: “You know how they get out? They get out. That’s how they get out. Declare victory and leave, because I’ll tell you, this country is just going to get further bogged down…So, I mean, this is a total catastrophe and you might as well get out now, because you just are wasting time.”
He continued to urge this in 2008 telling the United Kingdom’s GQ, “First, I’d get out of Iraq right now.” He told the magazine that he wished Sen. John McCain (R-AZ), the GOP presidential nominee at the time, “would promise to get us out of Iraq faster,” and called himself the “greatest hawk who ever lived, a far greater hawk even than Bush.”
As late as 2011, Trump told CNN, “Well, Iraq, we shouldn’t have been there and I’d get them out real fast. Afghanistan is not the bigger problem. The bigger problem is Pakistan.”"
100324,1001,Clinton is trouncing Trump among Asian American voters,http://www.dailykos.com/stories/2016/10/5/1578221/-Clinton-is-trouncing-Trump-among-Asian-American-voters,13,"Latinos aren’t the only immigrant group that doesn’t seem to want to have much to do with Donald Trump. Though the Asian American population is much smaller than the Latino population, Asian Americans are five percent of voters—and they’re five percent of voters that Donald Trump is losing badly. According to the National Asian American Survey, Trump is trailing Hillary Clinton by 41 points.

Clinton was drawing 55 percent support to Trump’s 14 percent. Ouch. If you count people who are leaning toward one candidate or the other, it’s 59 percent to 16 percent. Ouch again. And Trump may be hurting his party:

""The big takeaway is a continuation of what we saw in the Spring 2016 survey — an Asian-American population that was become more Democratic over time,"" Karthick Ramakrishnan, the survey's director, told NBC News. ""We see that Trump is likely a significant reason for that shift. Trump's unfavorables are like nothing we've seen before.""
Of course, the Asian American population is no monolith. It includes numerous ethnic groups with different backgrounds and political leanings. But this time around, they’re all leaning away from Trump. The smallest lead Clinton has (counting leaners) is a mere 26 points among Vietnamese Americans, 46 percent of whom say they support her, with 20 percent supporting Trump and a whopping 29 percent saying they’re undecided. At the other end, 73 percent of Korean Americans say they support Clinton, though she has the biggest lead among Indian Americans, 70 percent to seven percent.

In 2012, Barack Obama drew 68 percent of the Asian American vote to Mitt Romney’s 31 percent, so, if you count leaners, and with 16 percent still undecided, Clinton is running nine points behind Obama while Trump runs 17 points behind Romney. It looks like she’ll at least match and quite possibly exceed Obama’s margin here. And for good reason. Trump may be focusing his anti-immigrant remarks on Latinos, but Asian Americans are heavily immigrants or children of immigrants themselves. They can hear what he’s saying."
100325,1001,Hillary Clinton offers advice to a young girl on Donald Trump's body image bullying,http://www.dailykos.com/stories/2016/10/5/1578178/-Hillary-Clinton-offers-advice-to-a-young-girl-on-Donald-Trump-s-body-image-bullying,13,"A 15-year-old girl asked Hillary Clinton a question about body image at a Pennsylvania town hall event on Tuesday, saying “I see with my own eyes the damage Donald Trump does when he talks about women and how they look” and asking how Clinton would combat that damage. In her answer, Clinton turned Trump’s attacks on former Miss Universe Alicia Machado into a reason for women and girls to disregard insults to their own looks:

“My opponent insulted Miss Universe!” she said, to laughs. “How do you get more acclaimed than that? But it wasn’t good enough.”

She went on.

“We can’t take any of this seriously anymore,” she said, her voice building. “We need to laugh at it. We need to refute it. We need to ignore it. And we need to stand up to it.”
If Miss Universe isn’t hot enough then the girl next door can mope about the fact she’ll never be hot enough—or she can realize the game is rigged, in essence. Heidi Klum made a similar point in humorous fashion last year when Trump said she was “no longer a 10.”

“We’re not all going to end up being Miss Universe, I hate to tell you,” [Clinton] continued, wrapping up. “So let’s be the best we can be. Let’s be proud of who we are.”
Let’s also be very clear that insulting women—their looks, their stamina, or anything else—is all part of Trump’s crude dominance game. He’s saying he, Donald Trump, hair and orange skin and all, gets to judge all of us. We are all beneath him, suitable only for his disdain or for the privilege of maybe, in our dreams, being called as hot as his daughter Ivanka. And that should be viewed in the same light we view his Muslim ban or his Mexican wall or his reverence for Vladimir Putin. It’s disturbing. It’s scary. It should be a warning about a direction we do not want our country to head. But it should also be seen as delegitimizing."
100326,1001,Mike Pence's most defining moment in national politics will go unexamined in2016—but wait till 2020,http://www.dailykos.com/stories/2016/10/5/1578150/-Mike-Pence-s-most-defining-moment-in-national-politics-will-go-unexamined-in-2016-but-wait-till-2020#read-more,13,"Mike Pence's big national debut came in March 2015, just after he signed into law a ""license to discriminate"" bill that legalized religious-based bigotry against LGBTQ Americans. You could refuse to serve gay and transgender individuals at your business, deny them housing, or even fire them as your employees so long you as you were motivated by your religious beliefs to treat them as lesser human beings.

As we have written before, when Pence's monstrous law made national headlines and began sucking the economic life out of Indiana, the governor's clean up efforts crashed, burned, and killed his presidential hopes.

People might ask themselves, why would anyone agree to jump on Donald Trump's crazy train presidential bid? The answer: Because you've already derailed your own political career. Pence had not only dashed his presidential ambitions with his heinous ""religious freedom"" law, he was almost a sure loser for re-election in his own state this year. Republicans in Indiana were begging Trump to snatch Pence out of the Hoosier State so they might have a chance of retaining the governorship this November. They got their wish.

Pence deserved to be cross-examined on his bigoted law in front of a national audience during Tuesday night's debate. In fact, he has never found a good defense for rushing to legalize discrimination in his state and was ultimately forced to sign a partial ""fix"" to the law,  which nonetheless remains mostly intact.

Frustrated you don't live in a swing state? No matter where you live, MoveOn has a great way for you to get involved where it matters most. Check it out!

But as much as he has flailed on the very issue that brought him to national prominence, the moderator never saw fit to bring it up and Tim Kaine made only a passing reference to LGBTQ issues while mentioning Vladimir Putin's persecution of gay and transgender folks.

While this was undoubtedly a missed opportunity, it's also a ticking time bomb. Republicans walked away from Tuesday night mourning the fact that Mike Pence isn’t at the top of their ticket and, indeed, Pence spent the night boosting his 2020 chances.

Bring it! Pence's unabashed targeting of LGBTQ Americans was already antiquated and out of step with everyone but a small slice of social conservatives when he signed the law last year. Just imagine how Pence will defend that law in 2020.

By any measure, attitudes on LGBTQ issues have moved at lightning speed in comparison with other social issues. Pence's 2015 embrace of the bigoted law and rigorous efforts to defend the indefensible will be incomprehensible four years from now. If Trump/Pence goes down in flames next month and Pence somehow manages to survive until 2020, it will be up to Democrats to fully air what was clearly the most definitive moment in his political career. And then Pence will have the opportunity to do for the GOP nationally what he did perfectly for Republicans as governor of Indiana—kill their electoral chances. "
100327,1002,Exclusive — Mike Pence on How Hillary Clinton’s Disdain for Voters Disqualifies Her From Being President: ‘You Cannot Lead People You Loathe’,http://www.breitbart.com/2016-presidential-race/2016/10/05/exclusive-mike-pence-hillary-clintons-disdain-voters-disqualifies-president-cannot-lead-people-loathe/,13,"HARRISONBURG, Virginia — Indiana Gov. Mike Pence, the 2016 GOP vice presidential nominee, told Breitbart News exclusively that there is a “contrast” between GOP presidential nominee Donald Trump’s solutions-focused campaign and Democratic nominee Hillary Rodham Clinton’s negative campaign.
Here on his campaign bus after a rally with hundreds of supporters after he defeated his counterpart Democratic vice presidential nominee Sen. Tim Kaine (D-VA), Pence framed the election as a stark choice between someone who offers real change in Trump and Clinton—a protector of the status quo who is running a “real insult-driven campaign.” Pence told Breitbart News:

Donald Trump has given voice to the frustrations and aspirations of the American people like no leader in my lifetime since Ronald Reagan. He’s cast a vision to Make America Great Again. From the days of the primary through our convention and every day since, he’s been outlining the details and policies that will restore American strength at home and abroad, uphold our Constitution, promote the kind of trade policies that will put the American worker first, end illegal immigration. He’s laid out the details of those policies. And the contrast with the real insult-driven campaign of Hillary Clinton and Tim Kaine could not be more dramatic. Their campaign every day seems to be intent on calling a press conference and focusing on what Donald Trump said or Tweeted in the last days or weeks or in some cases years. But the reason why you saw the crowd here in Virginia, the reason why you see the enormous crowds that are coming out for Donald Trump, is because by articulating a vision and laying forth the policies for how we Make America Great Again, Donald Trump has inspired a movement in this country and I think it’s going to carry him all the way to the White House.

Pence added that, as that vision Trump has laid out for the country comes more and more into focus, it will propel him to the White House.

“I couldn’t have been more honored to be on that stage and sharing Donald Trump’s vision to Make America Great Again,” Pence told Breitbart News. “I know there’s a lot of talk about who won the debate, some people think we won the debate, but I think Donald Trump won the debate. I think Donald Trump’s vision to Make America Great Again won the debate. As you saw the enthusiasm here in Virginia today, I think that vision is going to continue to win between now and election day—and we’re going to elect Donald Trump the 45th president of the United States.”

The interview with Breitbart News, Pence’s first since winning the debate, also focused on Kaine’s inaccurate claim that Clinton apologized for her accusation that millions of Americans who support Trump for president were “irredeemable people” who are in the “basket of deplorables.” Pence, too, touched on how Clinton was caught on just-released audio tape bashing supporters of Sen. Bernie Sanders.

During the debate on Tuesday evening in Farmville, Virginia, Kaine falsely claimed that Clinton apologized to the millions of Americans she insulted by making those remarks. Clinton never apologized for them at all. With regard to the remarks about Trump supporters, she only said she didn’t mean “half” of them. Regarding the Sanders supporters, she never apologized at all. Asked about Kaine’s comments on the matter during the debate, Pence said his false claim that she apologized for insulting the American electorate was “remarkable.”

Pence went on to tell Breitbart News:

I’ll tell you on that one, it really was remarkable to me that after Sen. Kaine listed one personal insult against Donald Trump after another—then he accused us of running an ‘insult-driven campaign,’ just—it was remarkable to me. It was also remarkable because Hillary Clinton called millions of Americans who think we can Make America Great Again, who think we can stand tall on the world stage again, who think we can rebuild our military, revive our economy, stand by our Constitution—Hillary Clinton said millions of Americans who believe in Donald Trump’s vision for our country are in a ‘basket of deplorables.’ She said they are irredeemable. She said that they are not America. And despite what Sen. Kaine said last night, she never apologized for that—she just said she shouldn’t have said ‘half.’ So, you know, all she did was say she got the number wrong. But I think people across the country got the message. I expect Bernie Sanders supporters got the message earlier this week when it came to light in February that Hillary Clinton had referred to Bernie Sanders supporters as ‘children of the Great Recession’ who had moved into their parents’ basements.

Pence said that Clinton’s comments about Trump supporters and Sanders supporters disqualify her from being able to serve as president.

“I mean, you cannot lead people you loathe,” Pence said. “Hillary Clinton’s statements demeaning millions of Americans, including Bernie Sanders supporters, I believe disqualifies her to lead this nation as president. What I can tell you about Donald Trump is, whether you agree or you disagree with him, he is a man who respects the right of every American to make their choice in this election and to hold the views that they hold, and I couldn’t be more honored to stand with him.”

Ultimately speaking, when asked why the establishment media refuses to cover the movement of millions of people across the country coming out to Trump rallies and getting involved in the campaign nationwide, Pence said: “You’d have to ask them. I really don’t know.”

But he said that movement of people from all walks of life is exactly why he’s been so inspired as Trump’s running mate.

“It’s been one of the things that’s been most inspiring to me,” Pence said. “To campaign with Donald Trump, and to campaign for Donald Trump, is to literally see a movement of the American people. Donald Trump has articulated a vision for this country that is resonating with Americans from every walk of life. They are coming out, as they did here in Virginia today, in the middle of the week—in the middle of the afternoon—to get behind this man, and as he would be the first to say, to get behind a movement to Make America Great Again. I couldn’t be more excited about the days that remain in this campaign, and we’re just going to work our hearts out.”"
100328,1002,Trump Lays Out Plan to ‘Make America Wealthy Again’,http://www.breitbart.com/2016-presidential-race/2016/10/05/trump-lays-plan-make-america-wealthy/,13,"Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump laid out a five point plan to revitalize the American economy as he proclaimed to a crowd gathered in Henderson, Nevada, “We are going to make America wealthy Again.”
“First, we are going to repeal and replace Obamacare,” said Trump. Fixing America’s trade deals, securing the nation, ending government corruption, fixing inner cities, and helping Latino Americans were also part of the “Make America Wealthy Again” plan’s outline.

“America needs a comeback. America needs a change. And that’s why I’m running,” said Trump.

“President Obama said if you like your doctor you can keep your doctor. That was a lie. He promised his plan would reduce premiums by $2,500 dollars. Instead, they surged $5,000. Another lie,” said Trump.

Trump then hammered away at former President Bill Clinton’s statements this week on the failures of Obamacare:

Two days ago, Bill Clinton torched President Obama’s signature legislation. Remember, Hillary Clinton called Obamacare “one of the greatest accomplishments of President Obama, of the Democratic Party, and of our country.”

Bill has a different view. Here is what Bill said: He just said it’s a “crazy system,” and that “it’s the craziest thing in the world.” Bill said, “people out there [are] busting it, sometimes 60 hours a week, [and] wind up with their premiums doubled and their coverage cut in half…the people getting killed in this deal are the small business people and the individuals who make just a bit too much money to get any of these subsidies.” Clinton added that it “doesn’t make any sense,” and that “the insurance model doesn’t work.”

On my first day in office, I am going to ask a Republican Congress to send me a bill to immediately repeal and replace Obamacare. There is only one way to stop Obamacare: to vote for Trump.

“I think that President Obama should apologize for Obamacare,” said Trump.

He continued to the next point on his plan, “Fixing our trade deals will be the foundation of our economic revival.”

“Every time we start making progress, china starts devaluing their currency,” said Trump. “Our politicians don’t get it.”

“Our jobs are being lost in massive numbers, and we are not making things in America anymore,” he said.

Trump detailed the economic trials that have faced the United States in recent decades:

When I am President, we will start making things in America again. Our nation has lost one-third of its manufacturing jobs since Bill Clinton’s NAFTA – a deal supported by Hillary Clinton. Hillary’s Korea deal also cost us another 100,000 jobs. Since China entered the World Trade Organization – another Bill and Hillary-backed deal – 70,000 factories have shut down or left the United States. That’s 15 factories closing a day, on average.”

He remarked on the results of factories leaving, “Stores close, schools suffer, the tax base erodes, wages fall and the quality of life declines.”

“We’ve rebuilt other countries at the expense of our own,” said Trump who said he will renegotiated NAFTA. “If we don’t get the deal we want, we will withdraw from NAFTA and start over to get a much better deal for our workers.” Trump said he will also stop the Trans-Pacific Partnership that former Secretary of State and 2016 Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton called the “Gold Standard.”

American businesses will see lower taxes from 35 to 15 percent, according to Trump. Many small businesses will file as individuals and pay only 12 percent, he said of his plan, adding that he will fix the regulatory system. “Our regulations are a disaster,” they’re putting people out of business, he added.

Trump described that under his administration, “Our tax, trade, energy and regulatory reforms will help us reach 4% growth and create at least 25 million new jobs in a decade.”

“America will become the great jobs magnate of the world,” he said.

“To be a rich nation, we must also be a secure nation. Security begins at the border, you understand,” Trump said as he moved to the next point on his “Make America Wealthy Again” plan outline. “Any government that does not protect its own people is a government unworthy and unfit to lead,” he said.

As he has many times before, Trump listed by name and description a few of the many Americans who have been killed at the hands of illegal aliens: 21-yera-old Sarah Root, 21-year-old Grant Ronnebeck, young Kate Steinle, 90-year-old Earl Olander, 64-year-old Air Force veteran Marilyn Pharis, and 17-year-old Jamiel Shaw. He invited several “Angel” moms onto the stage to speak of their loved ones who have been killed.

The women attested strongly to Trump’s willingness to listen and act. Agnes Gibboney, whose family immigrated legally, lost her only son Ronald da Silva at the hands of an illegal alien. “Mr. Trump listens to us. We’ve had many meetings privately” and he listens, she said. Laura Wilkerson spoke of her son who was brutally murdered, tortured, and set on fire. “He cares about American families,” she said of Trump. “Mr. Trump seems the only one that gets the simplicity of this.”

Trump followed up saying, “All Americans living lawfully in this country, including millions of patriotic hardworking immigrants, are entitled to have their jobs, their wages, and their security protected. The borders around our nation are for the benefit of all people living here today – and when those borders are erased, it’s often the lawful immigrants already here who are the first to suffer lost jobs and decreased security.”

Trump said of illegal entrants to the U.S., “When I am president we are getting them out of our country.” He also spoke of many countries that refuse to take back their citizens from America and asserted that under a Hillary Clinton administration, she will accept that. But, he said, under his administration those countries will take back their citizens.

“At the same time, our country is being infiltrated by terrorists. Just two days ago, an immigrant from Bangladesh was charged in another ISIS plot. Hundreds of immigrants from high-risk regions have been implicated in terrorism inside the United States since 9/11,” said Trump who spoke of several very recent terror attacks in New York and New Jersey, a mall stabbing in Minnesota and a mall shooting in Washington State. He also listed other recent terror attacks. “The Boston Bombers were here on asylum. The San Bernardino Shooter was here on a fiancé visa from Saudi Arabia. The Orlando shooter was the son of a Taliban supporter from Afghanistan,” Trump said.

“We are also going to end the government corruption,” Trump continued to the next point on his economic plan. He referenced Clinton’s careless handling of classified information, the destruction of emails from the private server used to transmit that information, immunity deals for her staffers in the FBI’s investigation of the case, and side deals for the destruction of hardware. “Hillary Clinton is the ringleader of a criminal enterprise and the only way to deliver justice is to mail in your ballots.”

Coming to his final point, Trump said, “We are also going to fix our inner cities, and help Latino Americans.”

“Forty-five percent of African-American children under the age of six live in poverty. Fifty-eight percent of African-American youth don’t have jobs. More than 3,000 people have been shot in Chicago since the beginning of the year. Homicides are up nearly 50% in Washington, D.C. and more than 60% in Baltimore,” said Trump, who then pointed out “Democrats, like Hillary Clinton, have run the inner cities for 50 years, sixty years, seventy years or more. They’ve produced only more joblessness, failing schools, and rising crime.”

“To those African-Americans suffering in our country I say: What do you have to lose? Vote for Donald Trump. I will fix it,” said Trump. “I am also going to fight to help millions of Latinos trapped in poverty, and to help their children grow up in safety and peace.”

Trump said:

Here are some more amazing things we are going to do for our country starting in 2017: We are going to have the biggest tax cut since Ronald Reagan; eliminate every unnecessary regulation; end common core; repeal and replace job-killing Obamacare; make childcare affordable; save the 2nd amendment; support the men and women of law enforcement; rebuild our depleted military and take care of our vets; and appoint Justices to the Supreme Court who will uphold and defend the Constitution of the United States.

“A vote for Donald Trump is a vote for change and a vote for me is really a vote for you,” said Trump. “All together, we are going to Make America Wealthy Again. We Are Going To Make America Strong Again. We Are Going To Make America Safe Again.”"
100329,1002,Ann Coulter: Media’s Outrage Should Start Working Any Day Now!,http://www.breitbart.com/big-journalism/2016/10/05/ann-coulter-medias-outrage-start-working-day-now/,13,"Reviewing the state of the presidential race, I see that very little has changed for the past year. Every few weeks, the media roll out a new Trump “scandal” that has already been thoroughly covered, day in, day out, for the last 15 months.
In fact, all of the shocking new Trump scandals were aired in the very first GOP presidential debate, where he was asked seven questions about the following charges:

(1) He is mean to women.

(2) He is mean to Mexicans.

(3) He said nice things about Obamacare. (Since dropped by the media in order to help Hillary avoid the subject.)

(4) He is corrupt.

(5) He is a bad businessman.

(6) He is not a Republican. (Also since dropped — Hillary’s losing enough Democrats to Trump without reminding them that he’s not a “real Republican.”)

(7) His “tone.”

All that’s already been priced into the Trump brand. What new results do the media expect from telling us that Trump not only insulted Rosie O’Donnell, but also insulted Hispanic Mattress Girl, Alicia Machado: baby mama to a Mexican drug lord?

The only advance in the narrative is that the octaves of journalists’ voices keep getting higher, as they repeat the exact same attacks on Trump.

Each time, the media claim victory by asserting with bland certainty that any drop in Trump’s poll numbers is because of something very upsetting to journalists, but which is generally quite popular with voters — the Mexican rapists speech, the Muslim ban, and his response to the choleric Muslim, Khizr Khan.

The media can tell us where the candidates stand in the polls. They can’t tell us why. Nonetheless, they insist on identifying the precise statement of Trump’s that has caused any setback, which always happens to be whatever the media is being hysterical about.

Most absurd was the widely repeated claim that Trump’s “insult” of GOLD STAR DAD Khizr Khan caused him to dip in the polls. Except the problem is: (1) He didn’t insult Khan; and (2) anyone who occasionally leaves his apartment realizes that no one would have minded if he had.

Khan’s son was one of 14 Muslims to die serving in the U.S. military, which, coincidentally, is the precise number of American soldiers who have been killed by Muslims serving in the U.S. Military.

At the Democratic Convention, Khan waved a copy of the Constitution, asking Trump, “Have you even read the U.S. Constitution? I will gladly lend you my copy. In this document, look for the words, ‘the right of all Muslims in the world to move to America shall not be abridged!’”

Actually, that’s not in the Constitution. Incomprehensibly, Khan told Trump to look for the words “liberty” and “equal protection of law” — words that are noticeable for not mentioning “the right of all Muslims in the world to move to America.”

He rounded out his harangue saying to Trump: “You have sacrificed nothing and no one!”

In an article titled “Ire for Trump as He Derides Muslim Parents,” The New York Times described Trump’s response to Khan as “startling,” and said it “drew quick and widespread condemnation.” This included a tweet from Bush speechwriter Peter Wehner, calling Trump “a man of sadistic cruelty. With him there’s no bottom. Now go ahead and defend him.”

I must have accidentally been out of the country for a few days because I missed the part where Trump insulted the Khans.

But according to the Times, Trump was “derid(ing)” the Khans when he went on “Good Morning America” and called the snarling Muslim a “nice guy,” wished him luck, wondered why his wife didn’t say anything, and talked about the reasons Americans might want to hit the pause button on mass Muslim immigration.

To wit, Trump said:

“Well, I would say, we have had a lot of problems with radical Islamic terrorism, that’s what I’d say. We have had a lot of problems where you look at San Bernardino, you look at Orlando, you look at the World Trade Center, you look at so many different things. You look at what happened to the priest over the weekend in Paris, where his throat was cut, 85-year-old, beloved Catholic priest. You look at what happened in Nice, France, a couple of weeks ago. I would say, you gotta take a look at that, because something is going on, and it’s not good.”

I understand why the media are upset that Trump mentioned these notable contributions of Muslim immigrants, but unless I don’t know the country at all anymore, I do not believe a majority of Americans minded one bit.

The media are betting that after 9/11, the diaper bomber, the shoe bomber, the Boston Marathon, Fort Hood, Chattanooga, San Bernardino, the Orlando nightclub, the Chelsea bombing, and the recent mall attacks in both Minnesota and Washington, the revulsion of the American public to anti-Muslim bigotry will be a HUGE factor in this election.

Journalists swim in a sea of agreement. They don’t stop to think that the identity politics they majored in back in college might not be popular with all Americans.

Polls showed a post-convention bounce for Hillary before Trump had said word one about Khan. Perhaps their nonsense headlines about Trump attacking a GOLD STAR FAMILY also helped them in the short run.

But as soon as the public found out that it was this specific family and, also, that Trump didn’t attack them, voters weren’t mad at Trump, but they sure were with the media."
100330,1003,"New Role For Trump Adviser And Former Lawmaker: Lobbyist For Syrian Opposition
",http://www.huffingtonpost.com/opensecrets-blog/new-role-for-trump-advise_b_12363450.html?utm_hp_ref=politics,13,"Paperwork filed this week indicates that current Donald Trump campaign senior adviser and former Rep. Jack Kingston (R-Ga.), now of lobbying firm Squire Patton Boggs, has become a registered lobbyist for the High Negotiations Committee of the Syrian Opposition.

The committee leads a wide coalition of groups opposed to President Bashar al-Assad’s regime, but excludes two of the region’s most prominent militant groups, the Islamic State and al-Qaeda’s al-Nusra Front. Last month, the High Negotiations Committee, which receives Saudi support, negotiated the recent short-lived ceasefire with Assad’s forces.

While the registration itself is hardly groundbreaking given the revolving door between Congress and K Street, Kingston’s position as a Trump surrogate is noteworthy, if only because the Republican nominee’s policy on Syria has been so sparse thus far. Trump has thus far focused his Syrian strategy on bombing ISIS, though his partner on the presidential ticket, Gov. Mike Pence, articulated a need to “be prepared to use military force to strike the military forces of the Assad regime” during Tuesday’s vice presidential debate. “Provocations by Russia need to be met with American strength,” he said.

Russia, which has aligned itself with Assad’s regime, recently stepped up its joint bombing campaign on opposition-held areas, including Aleppo, leading the United States to withdraw from tortured peace negotiations. Given Trump’s praise for Russian President Vladimir Putin, Pence’s comments opposing Russian military action in Syria struck a note of discord.

But Trumpworld has always had a complicated relationship with Russia. As OpenSecrets Blog recently reported, a Russian-born oil magnate gave more $150,000 to Trump’s campaign and joint fundraising committee, and former Trump campaign chairman Paul Manafort’s business dealings with pro-Russian Ukrainian leaders have been well established.

Kingston’s lobbying registration represents a new twist in the Trump-Russia-Syria matrix, one that seems to comport more closely with the stance Pence took in the vice presidential debate. More broadly, however, the news is yet one more manifestation of the ability of former elected officials to continue to influence Washington, moving fluidly between the lobbying and campaign worlds."
100331,1003,The 2016 Election: How I Lost (My Sense of Humor),http://www.huffingtonpost.com/ilona-saari/the-2016-election-how-i-l_b_12335730.html?utm_hp_ref=politics,13,"When The Donald rode down the escalator with an entrance that would make Wayne Newton blush, I laughed out loud, giddy with the thought that a whole new bucket of satire just dropped into my lap. This was a joke, right?

I grew up in Queens, Long Island, New York just a stone’s throw away from The Donald, where The Donald types multiply like rabbits. Brash, self-centered, entitled bullies, they’re the template for the mobsters in “Goodfellas.” They’re self-righteous, primping peacocks who look down on women and minorities and who need to be the center of attention all the time... like TV pundits Hannity and O’Reilly - both from a Long Island ‘hood. But they don’t run for President. So, The Donald announcing his run was amusing. I envisioned gaudy TRUMP gold letters atop of the White House. I visualized his revamping of the Oval Office and state rooms into garish, “third world dictator chic.” Then I thought, nah, never happen. I had faith. Americans are way too savvy to elect a snake oil salesman to the presidency. He’d have his fifteen minutes, everyone would snicker and guffaw then reality, as opposed to reality TV, would settle back in.

Then came the primaries. Surely, one of those traditional Republicans would knock him on his keister, right? Wrong!

“They’re bringing drugs. They’re bringing crime. They’re rapists,” and The Donald was off and running, unleashing an ugly, dark side of many Americans. He bashed John McCain for not having sense enough to avoid capture, (“I like people who aren’t captured”) after he, himself, bone-spurred his way out of the draft altogether, and some Americans cheered. He called women pigs, fat slobs and worse, and some Americans cheered. He encouraged the support of white supremacists, and some Americans cheered. He promised to bring back torture, and some Americans cheered. He even bragged about the size of his penis, and many Americans laughed, including me.

But when he suggested that Hillary be handled by his 2nd Amendment followers, my sense of humor followed Elvis out the building. I hunted everywhere for it. I searched my house, then searched my hybrid SUV, but not a sense of humor anywhere. I did find an old “Don’t blame me, I was for McGovern” button under the driver’s seat.

I watched in amazement when his followers chanted “kill the bitch” and he said nothing. I watched with horror when he said that his followers should “knock the crap” out of a protester. I listened, stunned, when he suggested that all American Muslims should have ID cards. Perhaps sewn onto their clothing? And I just shook my head when he implied he lost the first debate because his mic was faulty. Wrong! I heard him just fine as he fumbled and stumbled, grunted and sniffled. He proved that he doesn’t have the physical or intellectual stamina for a job that needs 24/7 concentration on things other than himself.

Then Trump tweeted his latest toddler tantrum against one of his former Miss Universe winners.

I desperately needed my sense of humor back so I searched my house and car again. I lifted my patio potted plants but only found two old house keys. I even plunged my toilet. Nothing came up but a Trump bumper sticker.

His latest WTF is that he’s proud to have squandered almost a billion dollars, allowing him not to pay taxes for years... taxes which support our service men and women, our police and firefighters and pave our roads. “That makes me smart.” What? Losing nearly a billion dollars is smart? He’s proud of the fact that he files bankruptcies so he doesn’t have to pay American workers, stiffs seniors and others who enrolled in Trump University, that his Trump merchandise is made overseas, as he rails against others for doing the same while promising new manufacturing jobs in America. Really, Donald? Why not start by bringing all your manufacturing jobs back to America? He’s allegedly stolen from his own charitable foundation to pay for a portrait only Idi Amin could equal in narcissism! He’s lined his own pockets with money donated by hardworking people to his campaign. He’s also been fined for crooked business dealings, many of which are under investigation, and may have had illegal dealings with Cuba during our country’s embargo. And he calls Hillary crooked?

Yet, none of this matters to the Trumpettes and Trumpsters. Their fear, hate and anger at the changing world has clouded all judgment. They salivate over his racist, homophobic, misogynistic sputterings and cheer when he says he’ll make America great again, knowing full well that he means “Make White Male America Great Again” as they tip their “Made In China” hats to him.

This serial womanizing, lying, crooked Republican candidate has even encouraged his NRA supporters to patrol the voting polls... to walk around with their assault rifles and intimidate voters. What next, a call for a Kristallnacht against Muslim businesses and mosques?

I never thought I would lose my sense of humor. But then, I never thought I’d see the day when a cheating, multi-married, greedy, narcissistic, cotton-candy haired con artist, filled with venom and bigotry would ever be the presidential candidate for the once great but no longer Grand Ol’ Party. That is no laughing matter."
100332,1003,Mike Pence Turned Lying Into An Art Form,http://www.huffingtonpost.com/sherman-yellen/pence-the-placid-liar_b_12357210.html?utm_hp_ref=politics,13,"As I watched the VP debate I found it a fascinating non-character study. Pence lied with such tranquility it is clearly an art form he has perfected. None of the liar’s traditional sweat and shiftiness — just a long practised artist at prevarication who stayed placid and cool as he spouted lie after lie. For a man who proclaimed his piety Pence calmly, boldly, denied that Trump had made racist and sexist remarks, and he was clearly eager to have the power to deny women their right to freely choose, and LGBT people their right to freely live - all covered with an artificial whipped cream topping. He made it very clear that a Trump administration - bite my tongue - would undo all the progress made by minorities in the past fifty years. He was not even a man of the 20th century - I would place him comfortably somewhere in the 17th on most issues, the 19th on others. I am sure that his calm demeanor was reassuring to some conservatives - many of whom are troubled by voting for a madman - but for me he was just as scary as the top of the ticket. Pence revealed himself as a man of limited imagination who has never once put himself in the place of another less fortunate than himself - one who confuses his prejudices with his prayers.

Kane, whose nature is affable and a bit giddy, had a difficult time trying to break through Pence’s varnished veneer - and missed some important points. It is hard to debate so much self-righteousness as found in Pence. Kane failed to contradict Pence sufficiently when Pence kept misrepresenting facts - such as the alleged criminality of the undocumented - according to police records they commit many fewer crimes than the citizens among us. Pence’s remarks about the Syrian refugees could have been taken from the playbook of conservatives in 1940 who denied fleeing Jews a safe haven in our country, leading to their deaths in Europe.

Kane did keep hammering away at the numerous bigoted remarks that Trump has made - and Trump’s fascination with Putin and fascism, as well as Trump’s outrageous sexism, while Pence either denied what Trump had said - heard by all of America - or simply refused to answer for Trump’s bigotry. It was clear to me that Pence had enough bigotry of his own to deal with without defending Trump’s. Altogether an unsettling, unsatisfactory debate. Lunacy - spoken in a calm voice by Pence is still lunacy. If Pence represents that sane face of conservatism in our congress, we all need a little help from the gods to make sure he has no more power to interfere with and destroy the lives of others than he already has."
100333,1004,"Is Trump A Tax Code Genius? Hardly, Says Former Trump Accountant",http://talkingpointsmemo.com/livewire/trump-accountant-did-all-the-work,13,"Donald Trump has claimed that the 1995 tax documents reported by the New York Times show he's understands ""the tax laws better than almost anyone,"" but the accountant who prepared Trump's taxes that year threw cold water on Trump's claim in an interview published Tuesday.

""I did all the tax preparation. He never saw the product until it was presented to him for signature,"" the Trump family's former tax accountant Jack Mitnick told Inside Edition. ""I’m the one who did all the work.""

After the Times released its report revealing that Trump could have used a $916 million net operating loss in 1995 to avoid paying federal income taxes for up to 18 years, Trump has tried to spin the report into an account of his brilliance.

""I understand the tax laws better than almost anyone, which is why I am one who can truly fix them,” he said at a campaign rally on Monday. “I understand it. I get it. And that is what I commit to do.""

And his surrogates have claimed that the tax documents prove Trump is a ""genius"" with taxes.

But Mitnick's comments to Inside Edition suggest that Trump did not study up on the details of the tax code.

Mitnick gave a similar impression of Trump's involvement in the process in an interview with the New York Times. He said that Trump's first wife, Ivana, was more engaged in the tax preparation than Trump was. Per the New York Times:
In an interview on Wednesday, Mr. Mitnick said he could not divulge details of Mr. Trump’s finances without Mr. Trump’s consent. But he did talk about Mr. Trump’s approaches to taxes, and he contrasted Fred Trump’s attention to detail with what he described as Mr. Trump’s brash and undisciplined style. He recalled, for example, that when Donald and Ivana Trump came in each year to sign their tax forms, it was almost always Ivana who asked more questions.
Mitnick did tell the Times that Trump understood that he could use the tax code to his advantage.

""He knew we could use the tax code to protect him,” he said."
100334,1004,Pence Knocked For Calling Trump Disses About Immigrants ‘That Mexican Thing’,http://talkingpointsmemo.com/livewire/mike-pence-trump-immigration-comments-that-mexican-thing,13,"At the tail end of a vice presidential debate night spent defending running mate Donald Trump’s inflammatory past comments, a seemingly frustrated Indiana Gov. Mike Pence on Tuesday criticized Democratic VP nominee Sen. Tim Kaine (D-VA) for bringing up “that Mexican thing again.” Observers on social media quickly took note.

The line began trending on Twitter, with Mexican immigrants sharing stories of how their families came to the United States and criticizing the Republican ticket for belittling their contributions to society. Hillary Clinton's campaign jumped on the gaffe, purchasing the domain name ThatMexicanThing.com and having it redirect to a donation page on her website. The initial exchange came during a conversation about abortion, a procedure for which Trump said women should face “some sort of punishment” for obtaining if it becomes outlawed. When Pence said his running mate simply misspoke and would “never” adapt such a policy, Kaine said Trump’s words should be taken at face value, pointing at the real estate mogul's speech announcing his presidential run in which he labeled Mexican immigrants “rapists” and “criminals.”

“Senator, you’ve whipped out that Mexican thing again,” Pence said.

“Can you defend it?” Kaine asked.

“There are criminal aliens in this country, Tim, who have come into this country illegally who are perpetrating violence and taking American lives,” Pence said.

“You want to—you want to use a big broad brush against Mexicans on that?” Kaine asked.

“He also said ‘and many of them are good people.’ You keep leaving that out of your quote. And if you want me to go there, I'll go there,” Pence replied.

Trump’s actual line was a bit less sunny. From the lobby of Trump Tower in June 2015, the Republican candidate proclaimed that Mexico was “not sending their best,” “sending people that have lots of problems,” including “rapists” and those bringing “drugs” and “crime,” but that “some, I assume, are good people.”

100335,1004,"Under Fire, Eric Trump Said 7 Times That Dad Paid 'Tremendous' Amount Of Taxes",http://talkingpointsmemo.com/livewire/eric-trump-tremendous-taxes,13,"Pressed after Tuesday's vice presidential debate on his father's refusal to release his tax returns, Eric Trump said repeatedly that Donald Trump paid a ""tremendous"" amount of taxes. But he pivoted away from CNN's Dana Bash's persistent questioning on whether the GOP nominee paid federal income taxes.

""We pay a tremendous amount of taxes,"" the younger Trump said when Bash first asked him point blank if his father paid federal income taxes.

""Federal income taxes?"" Bash followed up.

""Yes, and beyond taxes..."" Trump said, before shifting to an attack on Hillary Clinton.

Dash interjected, ""Yes?"" and tried the question again: ""Eric, my question is though, has he paid federal income taxes over the last 18 years? Yes or no?""

""Yes, of course, yes, absolutely,"" Trump responded. ""My father pays a tremendous amount of tax. We as a company pay a tremendous amount of tax.""

He then bragged about the ""tremendous amount of people"" Trump's company has hired and the care those people are able to provide their families. He pivoted back to his attack on Clinton

""So if we ever see your father's income taxes, it will show that he has paid federal income taxes?"" Bash said, returning the discussion back to the unreleased tax returns.

""There's no question about it. We pay tremendous taxes as a company,"" Trump said.

Asked if the public will see the tax filings, Trump repeated his father's line that they would be released after an alleged audit is completed.

(The IRS has said such an audit would not prohibit someone from releasing his or her returns.)

Three times Bash asked Eric Trump, who was again railing on Clinton, if he had seen his father's returns.

""I don't study our tax returns,"" Trump dodged. Pressed again he said, ""Of course you see tax returns.""

""Have you seen your father's tax returns?"" Bash asked one more time.

""Of course I've seen my father's tax returns,"" he replied.

She asked again if he's paid federal income taxes.

""My father pays a tremendous amount of tax, as a company we pay a tremendous amount of tax, and it goes so far beyond federal income taxes,"" Trump said. ""How about real estate taxes? How about employment taxes? How about sales tax? We pay a tremendous amount of tax as a company that is different than Hillary Clinton, who has lived off the government for the last 40 years."""
100336,1005,The Key Moments From the Vice Presidential Debate,http://www.motherjones.com/politics/2016/10/best-moments-vp-debate-tim-kaine-mike-pence,13,"In a debate that was expected to have none of the fireworks of last week's presidential face-off, the two vice presidential nominees embraced their attack-dog roles Tuesday in a sparring match that was less about the men on stage than about Donald Trump.

Democratic Sen. Tim Kaine of Virginia used the debate in his home state to slam Trump repeatedly over his refusal to release his tax returns and his surprising comments about nuclear proliferation. Republican Gov. Mike Pence of Indiana, in turn, tried to dodge most of the attacks Kaine lobbed his way and used them to accuse Kaine of running an ""insult-driven"" campaign. Pence was also able to get in a few swipes at Hillary Clinton.

It was a messy, chaotic affair for two vice presidential hopefuls, both thought to be more mellow than their running mates. The two candidates often talked over each other during the debate—and over the moderator, CBS News' Elaine Quijano, who had a hard time holding Kaine and Pence to the allotted time and subject matter for each question.

Here are the best moments from the combative debate:

Pence defends Trump on not paying taxes

Following a New York Times report suggesting that Trump might not have paid any federal income taxes for nearly two decades by claiming $913 million in losses on his tax returns in 1995, Pence defended his running mate. ""Donald Trump is a businessman, not a career politician,"" Pence said. ""He actually built a business. He faced some pretty tough times 20 years ago. His tax returns—that showed he went through a very difficult time but he used the tax code just the way it's supposed to be used and he did it brilliantly."" Kaine goes after Trump's missing tax returns

Kaine went hard after Trump for not releasing his tax returns. He recalled that Trump promised back in 2014 that he would release his returns if he ran for president, and he said Trump broke that promise. Just as Pence shared his tax returns with Trump as part of the vetting process to be his running mate, Kaine said, Trump should share his returns with the American people as he runs for the job of president.   Pence accuses Kaine of running an ""insult-driven campaign""

Throughout the debate, Pence accused Kaine and Clinton of running an ""insult-driven campaign."" ""I have to tell you, I was listening to the avalanche of insults coming out of Sen. Kaine,"" Pence said early in the debate. What had Kaine said that had so offended Pence? The Democratic candidate had just ticked off a litany of statements that Trump had made over the course of the campaign. Pence used this to bring up Clinton's comment that half of Trump's supporters are in a ""basket of deplorables."" Kaine ridicules Trump's inability to apologize

When Pence noted Clinton's ""basket of deplorables"" comments, Kaine said she had apologized for how she phrased that comment. (She apologized for exaggerating and saying the ""deplorables"" made up ""half"" of Trump's supporters.) He went on to name a long list of insults that Trump has spewed since starting his campaign but not apologized for and said, ""You will look in vain to see Donald Trump ever taking responsibility for anybody and apologizing."" Kaine goes after Trump's penchant for praising dictators

Midway through the debate, Kaine rattled off a list of Trump's most controversial foreign policy ideas, from his questioning of the NATO treaty to his suggestions that the United States would be better off if more countries had nuclear weapons. But the best zinger came when Kaine listed the figures who would be carved into Trump's ""personal Mount Rushmore"": Vladimir Putin, Kim Jong-un, Moammar Gadhafi, and Saddam Hussein. Kaine suggests Pence revisit his fifth-grade civics lessons

Kaine criticized Trump for his connections to Russian oligarchs and took on Pence for praising Putin as a ""stronger leader"" than President Barack Obama. For this, Kaine suggested, Pence might need to retake fifth-grade civics.   Pence defends the Trump Foundation

Pence declined many opportunities to defend Trump's record against Kaine's onslaught of attacks throughout the night, but he finally backed his running mate up when it came to Trump's charitable foundation. The Trump Foundation, Pence claimed, ""gives almost every cent to charitable causes""—a statement that has been proved false time and again through dogged reporting from the Washington Post. Trump has used his foundation to send an illegal political contribution to the attorney general of Florida, to pay off legal fees incurred by his businesses, and to purchase portraits of himself. The foundation is currently being investigated by the New York attorney general. Pence defends Trump's record on abortion

Pence and Kaine went toe-to-toe on the issue of abortion. Kaine said Trump and Pence want to see Roe v. Wade repealed, resulting in laws that punish women for seeking abortions. Kaine also seized on a comment Trump made early in the campaign when he said women who seek an abortion should be punished. (Trump's campaign later walked back that comment.) Pence responded that he and Trump would not condone punishing women for abortion and defended Trump's past comments by noting that Trump isn't a ""polished politician"" like Clinton and Kaine. "
100337,1006,Is Mike Pence the frontrunner for the nomination in 2020 if Trump loses?,http://hotair.com/archives/2016/10/05/mike-pence-frontrunner-nomination-2020-trump-loses/,13,"I keep seeing this point made today in the wake of Pence’s debate win. I do not understand it. Which segment of the GOP will supposedly be Pence’s base in 2020? Conservatives? There’ll be gobs of conservative candidates running four years from now in the expectation that whoever wins the nomination will be a near-lock to end 12 years of Democratic rule in the general election. Pence will start the race with higher name recognition than most but also with a liability that none of the competition has, namely, the stigma of having been a top shill for Trump. If conservatives are looking to take back the party in 2020 and put the Trump interregnum behind them, the last guy they’d want to do that is Trump’s handpicked right-hand man. Especially since, as we saw after the RFRA debacle in Indiana, Pence isn’t all that trusted by conservatives in the first place. There’s no reason to choose him over, say, Scott Walker or a fresh face like Ben Sasse or Tom Cotton. On the contrary, if you dislike Trump, there’s a good reason to prefer them to him. And not only would Pence have the stink of Trump on him, he’d have the stink of defeat this November, fairly or not. Again, why not try something new?

How about Trumpers, though? Will they rally to Pence as the keeper of the flame? That’s possible, I guess, if Pence remakes himself as an ardent nationalist and starts drooling over foreign fascists like Putin, but I’m not sure he’s capable of it. He was much more Romneyesque last night than he was Trumpian in his policy preferences. He’s made some noise lately about changing his mind on trade deals like TPP to get square with Trump, but Pence has been a devout free-trader for most of his career and ended up pushing touchback amnesty as part of immigration reform while in Congress 10 years ago. I don’t know why any Trumper would trust that his conversion to nationalism, if it happens, is sincere and durable. I also don’t know that Pence would convert in the first place. I think he’s more likely to revert to his conservative roots after the election in the expectation that everything will be back to normal within the party in 2020. Remember — the whole reason Pence is on the ticket this year is that he’s not a nationalist. Trump picked him on the advice of his advisors, who thought that naming a movement conservative as veep would unite the party and reassure Trump skeptics on the right. Trumpers support him now only because he’s working to the same end that they are in trying to get Trump elected. If and when that effort fails, what use will they have for him?

And all of this assumes that the nationalists and reactionaries who favor Trump do so primarily because they agree with him on policy, with Pence capable of filling the void in 2020 simply by following Trump’s agenda in the primaries. Not so. Trumpism is as much style as substance. When his fans are interviewed about why they like him, they’re less likely to say that they agree with him on TPP than that he’s “politically incorrect” or that “he says what I’m thinking.” His boorishness gives him authenticity and makes him a scandal to the political class that his base despises. Stylistically, Pence is the polar opposite. He’s soft-spoken, devoutly Christian, has publicly forsworn personal attacks in campaigning, and instinctively plays it safe when faced with political dilemmas (e.g. RFRA). Pence is not a guy you can easily imagine standing up at a rally and saying, “We should waterboard the sh*t out of these terrorist scumbags.” Without that approach, he’s not really “politically incorrect” even if he agrees with the policy. Someone like Chris Christie is far better suited temperamentally to play the tough-guy centrist authoritarian inheritor to Trump. Or Rudy Giuliani, if not for the fact that Rudy will be 76 in 2020. It’s frankly hard for me to imagine Trump endorsing Pence in 2020, especially if Christie’s out there putting on a no-nonsense New-York-guy show about how we need a national moat or whatever,

There are other people who can play this part better than Pence, and they will play it. Trump did well enough in the primaries this year to guarantee that. If anyone tries to execute a too-cute melding of nationalism and conservatism on policy, it’ll be Ted Cruz because that’s what Cruz does — he triangulates opportunistically, and transparently. Convince him that he can’t win the nomination as a “constitutional conservative” and he’ll start rethinking free trade. But I don’t know that anyone can really marry Trumpism and traditional conservatism on substance apart from the few places where they obviously overlap, like immigration. I don’t know that they have to, either. Someone who’s Trumpian in affect, i.e. unapologetically and provocatively anti-PC and overtly contemptuous of “the system,” but also sufficiently even-keeled and well-versed on policy that he doesn’t ring any “we can’t possibly give this guy nuclear weapons” bells in interviews will probably do well in the primaries no matter which side of the nationalist/conservative divide he tilts towards policy-wise. Pence has the second part of that equation covered. Not the first, and he never will."
100338,1006,New York AG doesn’t show as much interest in Clinton Foundation as Trump charity,http://hotair.com/archives/2016/10/05/new-york-ag-doesnt-show-much-interest-clinton-foundation-trump-charity/,13,"Earlier this week Allahpundit reported on the loud and proud hammer which New York Attorney General Eric Schneiderman brought down on Donald Trump’s charitable foundation (the Trump Foundation) in the Empire State. A cease and desist order was issued, letting everyone know that Trump was most definitely not following the rules and that there was something fishy going on. Fair enough, I suppose. The rules are the rules after all, and if you don’t follow them you need to be brought into compliance.

But as Sarah Westwood reported at the Washington Examiner yesterday, Schneiderman didn’t seem to express as much interest in similar paperwork shortcomings on the part of Hillary Clinton’s charitable activities taking place under his watch. Instead, they were allowed to simply refile some forms and get on with business as usual.

Clinton Foundation officials quietly refiled three years of tax-related forms this week after the New York attorney general acknowledged the charity had failed to disclose all of its donors in accordance with state law.

Two entities operating within the Clintons’ sprawling philanthropic network — the Clinton Health Access Initiative and the Clinton Global Initiative — submitted supplementary financial disclosures for different years between 2012 and 2014 while denying Tuesday that the attorney general’s office had asked them to do so.

“The Clinton Foundation is properly registered to solicit funds under Article 7A, which requires organizations to register before they solicit funds in New York,” said Ricardo Castro, general counsel for the Clinton Foundation.
This is yet more evidence of the absolute partisan joke which Albany politics has become and now it’s impacting the race for the White House. The huge “scandal” regarding the Trump Foundation centers on their failure to register with a particular government bureau, not some deep, money laundering conspiracy. Once the oversight came to light, Schneiderman could have easily sent them a letter reminding them to correct the error, file their registration form and get on with their business. Instead, he chose to shut them down and hold a press conference.

But when it came to light that certain financial disclosures may not have been filed by the Clinton Foundation they were allowed to simply slip a few forms in the mail and continue operations. Should we be surprised? Not in the least. Schneiderman is a political animal with tremendous influence in the state Democratic Party and is widely reported to have his eyes on bigger things when his stint as AG is finished. He’s a Clinton donor and willing surrogate for her when asked to comment on the election. He’s also shown remarkably little interest in the various scandals embroiling the office of his boss, Governor Andrew Cuomo. If it weren’t for the diligent work of U.S. Attorney Preet Bharara we probably wouldn’t know much of anything about Cuomo’s activities and there certainly wouldn’t be multiple investigations into his financial affairs underway right now.

That entire episode with the Trump Foundation was a political stunt. At that point, nobody should take anything coming out of Eric Schneiderman’s office seriously."
100339,1006,CNN snap poll: Mike Pence won the debate,http://hotair.com/archives/2016/10/05/cnn-snap-poll-mike-pence-won-debate/,13,"The overall margin was 48/42 in Pence’s favor, but this is the number that matters: Sixty-two percent of Republicans said Pence’s performance made them more likely to vote for Trump. If the debate helped at all, that’s probably where it helped the most, by convincing some Trump-skeptic GOPers who have been holding out on supporting the ticket that there’ll be a steady hand close to the wheel if Trump wins.

The numbers below are interesting, though. Never underestimate the power of sheer likability. Pence was the more likable candidate last night so he won, even though it was Kaine who scored higher on understanding the issues and much higher on who better defended his running mate: The sample was 41D/30R, so don’t read too much into Kaine’s “issues” advantage — but do appreciate just how wide the likability gap was. Even among a Democratic-leaning group, Kaine’s obnoxious interruptions made Pence seem the more appealing of the two.

Jake Tapper made an insightful comment after the debate to the effect that Pence had won the night but he might not have won the week, by which Tapper meant that Democrats would have a field day with Pence’s many, many, many denials of controversial Trump comments in the past. Kaine brought up one dubious Trump statement after another — accurately, for the most part — whereupon Pence calmly denied that Trump had ever said any such thing. That drumbeat of lies worked wonders in the moment to reassure viewers that Trump wasn’t the wild man Kaine was portraying him as. It might not work as well in the aftermath. Jonah Goldberg: [Pence] was not very effective in defending Donald Trump. And I think that’s why in the long run tonight’s debate wasn’t very helpful for the Trump campaign. Over and over again, Pence simply denied that Trump had said any of the inconvenient, indefensible, inappropriate things that Trump has said.

That means the Trump campaign will very likely repeat the disaster of the first presidential debate. Trump lost that debate narrowly – more narrowly than Pence won tonight – but Trump was devastated in the post-debate spin wars. Pence’s denials will be fact checked all week, and that will hurt Trump. Because, for the most part, all of the Trump greatest hits Kaine brought up were accurate. That won’t help the campaign, though it will help Pence in 2020. In fact, if the story line becomes “Pence couldn’t defend Trump,” I fully expect Trump to publicly insult Pence in the next few days as punishment. Imagine Pence’s predicament in preparing for this debate, knowing that there were literally dozens of different dubious Trump remarks over the years that Kaine could toss at him and force him to answer for. At some point in the prep process, it seems, Pence gave up trying to master responses for each particular statement and opted to deny that Trump had ever said any such thing regardless of whether he had or not. It was, said Michael Brendan Dougherty, “one of the most avant garde performances in political history,” with Pence’s unflappable lies having the effect of making it seem as though Kaine rather than Trump was the one with the wild imagination that had generated so many dubious ideas.

It worked in the moment, but will it work going forward? Liam Donovan argued this morning that Democratic ads fact-checking Pence’s denials about Trump won’t work. It’s much more effective to simply point out that “Trump said X,” he noted, than to point out that Mike Pence lied in claiming that Trump never said X, so why bother doing it? Just stick to “Trump said X” attack ads. I don’t know about that, though. Watch the new Clinton ad below and see how her team did. If viewers really did come away from the debate last night believing that Tim Kaine is a liar and that Trump never said the awful things imputed to him, Democrats obviously need to disabuse them of that and convince them that Pence was the one who was lying. I think there’s value independently too in pointing out that Trump’s own running mate, presented with some of his worst excesses, evidently felt his best option was to lie than to try to defend them. That suggests that Pence agrees that they’re indefensible. That’s a more damning indictment of Trump than self-interested criticism from the other party is.

Exit question via David Frum: Did Pence’s strategy last night point to a broader post-Trump strategy for the GOP, namely, pretending as though Trump never happened? The hallmark of the GOP leadership in Congress is politely ignoring ideas that make their base happy, starting with tighter borders and economic protectionism. Why wouldn’t they follow the same approach in trying to move past Trump?"

Basically, Tim was just throwing a bunch of stuff against the wall to see if would stick.

He didn’t seem to care if his answers made sense or if it was his turn to talk.

He was unpresidential and downright annoying at times. That shouldn’t surprise anyone.

But apparently, even his wife was a little put off by it. From Washington Examiner:

Democratic vice presidential candidate Tim Kaine said Wednesday that even his wife said he interrupted too much during his debate this week with Indiana Gov. Mike Pence. “The debate was a little feisty, I got to admit,” the Virginia senator said Wednesday at a campaign rally in Philadelphia. “I’m Irish.”

“For me,” he added, “I got dinged a little bit, even by my wife, for, like, interrupting too much.” Kaine is a really goofy guy and he probably thinks he is being cute and personable by saying something like this.

But it makes him look even worse.

Blaming your shoddy performance on being Irish?

Nobody can blame his wife for being a little annoyed.

Liberals freak out whenever Donald Trump interrupts someone.

Tim Kaine?

Not so much…"
100341,1007,"Huge Company Led By Hillary Donor Accused Of Major Tax Dodges, Clinton Camp Silent",http://www.youngcons.com/huge-company-led-by-hillary-donor-accused-of-major-tax-dodges-clinton-camp-silent/,13,"Hillary Clinton has been running around claiming that Donald Trump broke the law on his taxes even though he clearly just took advantage of tax laws that are on the books.

The whole tax issue with Donald Trump is a total non story.

But, candidates who don’t have a lot to offer usually fixate on irrelevant things like that with their opponents.

The strange thing is that Hillary Clinton is picking and choosing who she gets outraged at. A buddy of hers who donates tons of money to her was recently accused of dodging taxes.

But for some reason, I don’t think she’s going to return the money to him… From The Daily Caller:

Apple Inc., whose CEO Tim Cook is a major Hillary Clinton supporter and donor, has been named the biggest U.S. corporate tax avoider by a group that monitors the issue. The tech giant avoided paying $65 billion in U.S. taxes on $215 billion its offshore subsidiaries took in last year, according to a new report from Citizens for Tax Justice (CTJ), a progressive Washington D.C. think tank.

But Clinton has avoided mentioning Apple in her critique. That could be because Cook is a major backer of Clinton’s campaign and her family charity, the Clinton Foundation. In August he hosted a $50,000-a-ticket fundraiser for the former secretary of state at his home in the San Francisco area. A co-host of the function was Apple executive Lisa Jackson, the former head of the Environmental Protection Agency who was embroiled in a scandal involving her use of a pseudonymous email account while in office.

Well that’s weird!

If Trump is such a monster for following the law, maybe Hillary should return the money that Tim Cook helped her get?

Hillary hypocrisy isn’t a surprise at this point but I mean come on…"

Not only did Kaine lie a lot but he didn’t look even remotely presidential up there.

100343,1008,Does Common Sense Plus Polling Mean a Big Trump Win?,http://www.americanthinker.com/articles/2016/10/does_common_sense_plus_polling_mean_a_big_trump_win.html,13,"The ""unskewed polls"" fiasco of 2012 will live in infamy for many years until usurped by an even bigger failed prediction.  Unfortunately for conservatives, the mainstream media didn't miss a beat in weaponizing polls in favor of Hillary Clinton during the current campaign, leaving many of us demoralized and in search of answers.  The pollsters are skilled at shorting certain samples (independents), adding others (Democrats), and then creating a unique top line that defies the data included in the poll itself.  This is done in such a bold manner that it's almost as if the polling companies are daring us to start the next polling conspiracy.

I am still not a fan of recalibrating a poll and issuing a corrected number.  However, anyone with a knowledge of modern elections should be able to tell that some things are wrong just by listening to the media narrative and looking at numbers available to anyone willing to click a mouse a couple of times.  For the sake of comparison, I will be discussing elections from 1992 to present (the birth of the ""big blue wall"" of states).

With a noted lack of volunteer support and voter enthusiasm painfully evident in Ohio, the Clinton campaign has been rumored to be focusing funding and energy outside the historical bellwether state.  The New York Times, shamelessly and always ""with her,"" came to the rescue and proclaimed that Ohio is no longer the pulse of the electorate because of the vaunted ""changing demographics"" explanation.  Apparently, those ""deplorable"" blue-collar white workers without college degrees have lost their luster as gatekeepers of political fortune.

If the Clinton campaign is indeed cutting its losses in Ohio, internal polls must reflect a generous margin for Trump.  If three points is considered within the margin of error, five points should be marginally competitive, especially in the event of an October surprise.  It is possible that the lead is larger than the five points asserted in this week's Quinnipiac poll and in many other forecasts.

Before I proceed, let's get one thing straight.  Most forecasters have Ohio solidly in red five weeks before the election.  This is the same state that hasn't backed a loser in the general election since 1960, when its electors cast their votes for Richard Nixon.  Many alert liberals jump on the math immediately, pointing out enthusiastically that President Obama would have still won in 2012 with 314 electoral votes without Ohio.  What those folks fail to understand is that if Ohio drifts right, so does the rest of the nation.  When it drifts left, so does the nation with it.

With the lone exception of the dramatic 2000 election finale, Florida has voted to the right of Ohio in all six elections since 1992.  The Sunshine State voted for Obama in 2008 by a 2.8% margin before barely going for him four years later with a margin of 0.9%.  If Trump is up so big in Ohio that it's thought to be in the bag, I have a difficult time believing that Florida, on a right-swinging year on the political pendulum at that, is not going for him as well, especially given the absentee ballot request differential favoring the GOP.

Florida's black population (16%) was certainly a boon to Obama's campaigns, and it is not reasonable to expect Clinton to perform as well or to benefit from the same volume of minority voters this year.  For the same reason, I do not expect North Carolina to be a struggle for Trump.  With a black population near 22% and with Obama not on the ballot, I'm not even sure it's going to be close.  The state went to Bush by over 12 points in each of his two campaigns.  Both states are noted for ""demographic changes,"" but I do not believe that those changes will be so substantial in a period of four years to cost Trump in a right-swinging year.  The same turnout theory applies to Virginia, which swung nearly 15 points between 2004 and 2008.  Anyone telling you that Virginia is gone for good is overreacting.

Another reliably blue state not being discussed in the narrative this year is Iowa, which Obama won by nearly six points four years ago.  The GOP barely took the Hawkeye State in 2004, but it has been a tough one, even with favorable demographics for Republicans.  Benefiting from the no-college white voter, Trump is thought to be ahead by as much as six to ten points, which would represent a substantial swing in a short time span and a sign that the upper Midwest may be entirely in play for the GOP.

If you're wondering why the Trump campaign is spending time in Wisconsin, look back at your electoral history.  When Bush carried Ohio in 2000 and 2004, by 3.5% and 2.1%, respectively, Wisconsin stayed blue by less than half a percentage point each time.

Depending where you get your news, you may not have heard the term ""political pendulum"" this year.  It is a convenient thing in this year's narrative to ignore the fact that three straight incumbent party terms are rare and haven't occurred since the GOP won three elections in the eighties.  In my opinion, Ohio is still the barometer for success, just as it was four years ago.  If Trump can carry the Buckeye State by six points or more, he stands a good chance to also carry Pennsylvania and Michigan, which are full of blue-collar voters who have been sidetracked by the economic woes of the past two decades.

In conclusion, I would encourage people to understand the purpose of polling – to influence thought; depress turnout; or, most dreadfully, to justify fraud or theft.  Don't get stuck in the trap of trying to generate the actual numbers, but look at your map and statistics.  A right-tilting Ohio does not historically correlate with a left-tilting Florida and North Carolina in a right-swinging election against a scandal-ridden establishment candidate who lacks youth support and will never gain the same volume of minority support as the man she is seeking to replace.  The media is playing us for fools.

100344,1008,Hillary the Abnormal,http://www.americanthinker.com/articles/2016/10/hillary_the_abnormal.html,13,"The media are saying that it’s okay for them to abandon their “impartiality”, as though anyone believed they ever were, because Trump is such an abnormal candidate. That Trump is so horrible that no matter what illegalities Hillary has committed or how frail her health may be, she’s better than Trump.

As a proud former member of #NeverTrunp I have no problem saying that Trump is a far more normal presidential candidate than Hillary Clinton.

Like most previous presidential candidates, Trump actually likes America and Americans. After eight years of Obama, many Americans have forgotten what it’s like to have a president who actually sticks up for his country rather than apologizing for it and attacking it.

Despite many political differences Ronald Reagan and JFK both believed in the American dream and in American exceptionalism; which results from a true diversity that liberals hate: the blending of the best from many different cultures from WASPs to Hispanics to Blacks to Italians.

Hillary views us as peons to be ruled by her and her cohort. Trump wants to empower Americans to run their own lives not make them subservient to Hillary’s ruling class.

While Trump is following in the footsteps of JFK and Ronald Reagan, Hillary is a fawning admirer of government by the politicians, for the politicians, and of the politicians.

Hillary is also the first presidential candidate to tell churches what they should or shouldn’t believe in. According to the Gospel of Hillary abortion is a sacrament. She’s all for forcing nuns who dedicate their lives to helping the poor to pay for abortions, and she’s enthused about making five-year-old girls share the washroom with 40-year-old bearded men who say they think they’re really women.

While most Americans who do support abortion support it only in cases of rape, or to protect the life of the mother and then only in the first trimester Hillary supports abortion up until the instant of birth for any reason. Hillary is also quite comfortable with Planned Parenthood profiting by selling baby parts.

There are simply no candidate in the history of the U.S. with such a radically anti-Christian morality agenda. Even Hillary herself used to say when Bill was president that abortion should be safe, legal, and rare.

In terms of morality, it’s Trump who actually believes in religious liberty and who opposes abortion in general and is far more in the lineage of past presidential candidates, Republican and Democrat.

It used to be that presidential candidates agreed that politics stops at the waters edge; that foreign policy should be based on what’s good for America.

But Hillary showed she’s cool with Obama’s belief that we should not worry about the world because cutting military spending frees up dollars to buy voters and line her own pockets.

Hillary supports a deal that will allow Iran to have nuclear weapons in the near term. Can anyone imagine any presidential candidate of the past, with the exception of John Kerry, who would do that, given that the mad mullahs constantly and unequivocally support terrorism?

Trump opposes unnecessary foreign involvements, he clearly puts American interests first, and he opposes the Iran deal. Sure because Trump is Trump his position might change but Trump has never advocated overthrowing a foreign government, as Hillary did in Libya, and then simply walked away from the people who suffered as a result, as Hillary did. Historically, even when America has made a mess we’ve tried to undo it; as Bush did in Iraq and Truman did in Korea.

Hence Hillary is far more abnormal than Trump in the foreign policy arena because she either believes foreign policy doesn’t matter -- given her abysmal record as secretary of state this is likely -- or that America’s interests shouldn’t come first.

While there have been previous candidates who were racists -- Woodrow Wilson comes to mind -- the reality is that since Eisenhower, American presidential candidates have opposed the invidious racism that permeated the Democrat party, especially in the South.

Yet Hillary opposes school choice for inner-city Blacks, is comfortable with the fact that Black unemployment is twice white unemployment, isn’t bothered by the fact that the leading cause of death for Black Americans is abortion, and wants to bring in millions of low skill illegals to drive down the wages of the poorly educated Blacks that Democrat cities produce.

Trump’s supposed “racism” is based on his rejection of the claims of those who come here illegally and to his objection to radical Muslims who say that Sharia should be the law of the land. Trump is being called a racist for adhering to Rev. Martin Luther King Jr’s admonition to judge people by the content of their character rather than the color of their skin; welcoming a legal Mexican immigrant while rejecting an illegal Polish immigrant. Trump is also reaching out to Blacks to see how we can fix the problems resulting from the endemic racism in the Democrat party.

Based on their positions it’s clear that there is a racist in this presidential race and it’s Hillary.

In terms of the role of the presidency, Hillary supports Obama’s view that unless a court slams him down, and in some cases even then, he can do whatever he wants.

Whether it’s the use of the IRS to target political opponents, using the FBI to sweep criminal activity under the rug, or the unlawful “legalizing” of hundreds of thousands of illegals Obama has made it clear that the Constitution is a dead letter to him. Hillary supported that when she was in his regime and she has used it to her advantage since.

Based on their track records it’s Hillary, not Trump, who believes she’s above the law and that the Constitution doesn’t matter. Sure, Trump used the full power of the law to try and force a widow out of her home but when he lost he walked away. He didn’t hire someone to steal her property. He didn’t think he could break the law with impunity the way Hillary does.

Finally, much is being made of Trump’s less-than-stellar personal life. Sadly, the reality is that presidents such as LBJ and JFK were not paragons of sexual morality either. While it’s true that there is no record of Hillary personally philandering, she did viciously attack women her husband sexually harassed and/or allegedly assaulted.

She covered for Bill’s escapades thereby enabling him to harass more women, and she did so for apparent personal gain. After all, no one would have ever heard of Hillary without Bill’s presidency since, other than ensuring that a child molester got one year for raping a 12-year-old, she’s never done anything that would get anyone’s attention.

Additionally, Hillary blamed an innocent Egyptian Christian living in the U.S. for what she knew was a preplanned terrorist assault on Benghazi that succeeded in killing the U.S. ambassador because Hillary had failed to take prudent security precautions.

While philandering decreases with age, thereby making Trump less of a risk, there is no declining in the huge character flaws of Hillary Clinton.

There is no previous example of a presidential candidate who so shamefacedly lied to the American people to cover their own political ambitions as Hillary has.

Bottom line -- there is an abnormal, outside-the-historical-limits candidate in this presidential race -- Hillary.

100345,1008,Of Prudence and Principle: Ted Cruz Endorses Donald Trump,http://www.americanthinker.com/articles/2016/10/of_prudence_and_principle_ted_cruz_endorses_donald_trump.html,13,"How do you tell whether someone in public life acts out of moral principle or cynical pursuit of his own advantage? Is it at all a complicated matter? Does it require thought on what motivates a genuine statesman, and how the intention to do good must take account of practical reality? Apparently not, to judge by the conflagration of scorn, ignited in certain circles when Senator Ted Cruz decided to endorse the candidacy of Donald Trump. To Dr. Charles Krauthammer Krauthammer on Cruz: ""This Is Politics; Exactly What You'd Expect"" ...and to the editors of the Wall Street Journal ""Ted Cruz’s Convictions"", Cruz’s decision was so palpably corrupt that no reference to the fate of the nation if Trump loses was even necessary.

In his written announcement Facebook post, Senator Cruz sets out six urgent policy concerns -- the Supreme Court and the Bill of Rights, Obamacare, energy, immigration, national security, and Internet freedom -- that compel his vote for Trump. They are not taken up by his detractors, except insofar as the Journal’s editors dismiss them for having been no less true two months ago, when Cruz “ostentatiously refused to endorse Trump.” Krauthammer’s rebuke amounts to his recollection that both Cruz and Trump claimed to be outsiders, above the corrupt mores of politicians, and now look at them. Krauthammer does not take very seriously Cruz’s claim to have searched his conscience before doing this: a “quick search of a very small place,” as in the case of all politicians (they lack the moral depth of television talking heads). Neither do the Wall Street Journal opinion writers think Cruz capable of honest deliberation. Cruz must be thinking only of his own career in belatedly reconciling himself to Trump.  

The Journal editors do betray something of their original hatred of Cruz when, looking forward to a Hillary Clinton administration, they preemptively reproach Cruz for thwarting Republican congressional efforts to give her whatever she wants (to “compromise” and thereby “modestly advance” conservative goals” in Journal-speak). This is entirely congruent with their grounds for scorning Cruz during the Obama years. Only a dishonest grandstander would try to get his congressional colleagues to use the constitutional power of the purse and the mechanism of checks and balances to arrest terrible executive policies, policies often called pernicious and unconstitutional by the Journal editors themselves.

The Journal accuses Cruz of not becoming one of Trump’s antagonists “for months during the primaries when the businessman might have been defeated.” The attacks on Trump by Bush, Paul, Rubio, Graham, and Fiorina were unavailing, but had Ted Cruz only joined the attackers it would have been a different ballgame. In fact, what launched Trump and made him so formidable was the resentment generated in millions of voters by the Republican leadership’s failure to confront Obama and to make good on the promises issued during the 2010 and 2014 elections. As a senator, Ted Cruz, more than anyone, sought to buck this tendency and to initiate resistance. But that was unwillingness to compromise for the sake of moderately advancing conservative goals.

Of course, you could say that endorsing Trump was compromise for the sake of advancing conservative goals, or preventing the complete dominance of socialist ones. Why don’t we experiment a little with the premise that Cruz is a better man than his detractors and consider the compromise he had to make? He had more reason than they to resent the malice and mendacity of Donald Trump. It was not their loved ones whom Trump aspersed.

As to Cruz’s ostentatious refusal to endorse Trump at the convention, we will leave to the Journal’s editors their notion of ostentation, but reply that he did not refuse to endorse. He refrained from doing so in his address. Then, meeting with the Texas delegation, he said that he was not in the habit of supporting those who attacked his family members. None who call themselves men are. But he seems to have departed from the habitual and endorsed someone he has reason to hate. Those deriding Cruz take it for granted that the only effect of the endorsement will be upon his own career. We might remind them that Cruz came in second, behind Trump, and has some influence with movement conservatives -- not a decisive factor in the primary contest, but a party component that Trump now badly needs to attract. Is it possible that Cruz, seeing that the election was getting quite close, took a step both personally painful and likely to bring opprobrium down upon his head, took it for the sake of stopping Hillary Clinton -- took it for his country?

How does it work, anyway, this compromise business? Is it something you are to do only with leftists, once they are ensconced in the world’s most powerful office? Is it admirable to bend to the will of an Obama or a Clinton, but not to put aside one’s private passions to help Trump prevail over Clinton, when he is the only alternative to her presidency?

Liberal Republicans freely lecture conservatives on the necessity of “moderation” and “prudence” (sometimes they say “pragmatism”). They loudly proclaim the folly of demanding conservative “purity.” And yet what is it other than a demand for purity that causes a Journal columnist like Bret Stephens to write that his “fundamental objection to Trump is that he is unfit, as a person, to be president” and we do not “elect a policy menu?""  NeverTrump for Dummies This means that the policy differences between the candidates are irrelevant -- the point is whom Mr. Stephens deems to be of sufficiently upright character (Hillary Clinton?). And so it matters little whether the Titanic has a captain who steers her into an iceberg or another one who does not: let the ship founder so long as its captain is fit, as a person, to be such. And if the American ship of state should go down by the bow, like the Titanic, then as the stern dips beneath the waves we can still admire the moral probity and independence of our erstwhile conservative pundits, and that is the important thing.

Prudence, “not to be confused with mere cleverness or cunning,” (Carnes Lord, “Aristotle,” in Strauss and Cropsey, History of Political Philosophy, /Chicago: University of Chicago Press, 1987; 1963 130-31) seeks to achieve a virtuous goal by taking into account the actual, current circumstances around us. Moderation, Aristotle tells us, is the moral quality that preserves prudence, freeing us from the passions associated with the love of pleasure and aversion to pain. (Ethics, Bk. VI) To repeat somewhat, the decision to support Trump must have been a painful one for Cruz, but intended to stave off a continuation of the calamitous presidential leadership that characterized the last nearly eight years. The ambivalent conservatives who disparage Cruz, by contrast, are blinded by their loathing of him and Trump. They also appear slightly inebriated with their role as beings too ethically pure to join the Republican cause, even when the adversary is Hillary Clinton.

Cruz displays a prudence that they simply lack.

100346,1009,"LATEST HILLARY EMAILS RAISE QUESTIONS ABOUT CORRUPTION, CHINA",http://www.powerlineblog.com/archives/2016/10/latest-hillary-emails-raise-questions-about-corruption-china.php,13,"Judicial Watch released another set of Hillary Clinton’s State Department emails today; these are slowly being produced in response to one or more court orders. You can download some of them here. Two email threads are particularly interesting, both relating to China. This is the first thread, dated September 2010. Click to enlarge: Doug Band was a key adviser to Bill Clinton who represented the Clinton Foundation. Huma Abedin asked Band how Bill Clinton’s meeting with “Wen,” i.e., Chinese Premier Wen Jiabao, went. Huma explained that Hillary Clinton, then Secretary of State, wanted “points” from Wen’s meeting with her husband so she could use them in her own meeting with Wen, which apparently was taking place at that very moment.

Band forwarded Huma’s request to Amitabh Desai, another Clinton Foundation employee, who described the meeting to Abedin. Some highlights:

Wjc mentioned South China Sea, wen said it’s clear China controls it and don’t need any more discussions or agreements and hopes wjc can help make this clear.

China’s neighbors do not agree that China has a right to the entire South China Sea, and this has become a contentious issue on the world state. Did Bill Clinton, who in 2010 held no official position, “help make…clear” China’s hegemony over the South China Sea?

On trade, wen said china doesn’t seek trade surplus [Ed.: a ridiculous assertion] and asked wjc to help avoid currency legislation b/c it’ll mean lots of chinese businesses collapsing, jobs lost, and migration from cities to rural areas.

The reference is evidently to U.S. legislation aimed at currency manipulation by China. Did Bill Clinton–again, a private citizen as of 2010–help his Chinese friends “avoid currency legislation”? Such legislation has been proposed, but, to my knowledge, not enacted.

Wjc said people seeking good relations with china also are looking internally at how US can help itself

Wjc suggested more cooperation on energy especially transport, to reduce US imports of oil (thereby reduce US trade deficit)

Wjc suggested china use US dollars not only to buy treasuries but also to invest in US to help put Americans to work–said this would make a huge difference

Bill Clinton is acting here as an advisor to the Chinese government. In particular, he is offering suggestions as to positions China might take when dealing with the President of the United States:

Wen said he would raise both ideas with bho

This is all rather stunning. Bill Clinton was an advisor to the Chinese government–a paid advisor, too; during his post-presidency, Clinton and the Clinton Foundation reaped hundreds of thousands of dollars, perhaps millions, from the Chinese government and other Chinese entities. Bill gave advice to the Chinese Premier, and his aides forwarded the substance of his conversation with Wen to his wife, the Secretary of State, for her use in her own meeting with Wen. And Wen said that he would use Bill Clinton’s ideas in negotiating with Barack Obama. The incest is bad enough, but the money flowing from China to Bill and Hillary Clinton make these arrangements corrupt by any definition.

The second set of emails, reproduced in their entirety below, relate to an invitation that the Chinese government extended to Bill Clinton to attend an event in Beijing in December 2011 to commemorate the tenth anniversary of China’s joining the World Trade Organization. The first email, dated September 30, 2011, comes from Du Shuang of the Commercial Office of the Chinese Embassy, and is addressed to Amitabh Desai, an employee of the Clinton Foundation who also wrote the email above.

It says, in part:

Twelve years ago, under the capable leadership of H.E. President Clinton [I assume H.E. stands for “His Excellency”] and Chinese leaders, the U.S. and China successfully signed the Bilateral Agreement on China’s WTO Accession. That Agreement greatly accelerated China’s negotiation process, symbolizing a critical step for China to enter into the WTO. …

As an eyewitness and advocate of China’s entry into the WTO, H.E. President Clinton is of prime importance and special significance to the Forum. As VIP guest of the Forum, President Clinton will meet and take photographs with China’s top leaders attending this occasion. He will also be invited to address the audience at the Forum for around five minutes.

Bill Clinton did indeed play a key role in accelerating China’s entrance into the World Trade Organization and thereby facilitated the enormous role that China now plays in international trade. Bill Clinton was no doubt proud of having advanced China’s interests (and, many would say, the interests of the U.S. and other nations) in 2001. But by late 2011, when these emails were written, China’s trade role was not viewed so positively in the U.S.

Desai responded almost immediately, wanting to know whether China’s President Hu would be present at the December event. A week later Du Shuang replied that Hu would be there. He added:

We really hope President Clinton can attend the event as we attach great importance to his support of China’s accession to WTO.

Oddly, Desai waited a month before doing anything further. Finally, on November 8, he wrote to Hillary Clinton’s committee of insiders at the State Department, Huma Abedin, Cheryl Mills, Michael Fuchs and Jake Sullivan:

The Chinese government is inviting WJC to an event in Beijing on December 10-12, celebrating China’s accession to the WTO ten years ago. … Would USG [the United States Government] have any particularly positive or negative feelings about this?

Various State Department employees then went back and forth on the invitation. Their emails are unclassified, but every word is redacted. The contents of the emails were withheld by State under the kitchen sink b5 exemption, even though it is hard to imagine any basis on which they were privileged. One can easily speculate that the topic under discussion was the politics of free trade as of late 2011. The upshot was that Bill Clinton apparently did not attend the event in Beijing.

If I were working for the Trump campaign, I would find these email threads of great interest."
100347,1009,TRY TO MAKE IT REAL COMPARED TO WHAT,http://www.powerlineblog.com/archives/2016/10/try-to-make-it-real-compared-to-what.php,13," the Washington Post’s John Wagner on last night’s debate performance by Tim Kaine:

At the vice-presidential debate here Tuesday. . .Kaine turned in a performance that threatened to undermine the image of authenticity that has been one of his greatest strengths.

The senator from Virginia came across as over-rehearsed, often interrupting his Republican opponent, Gov. Mike Pence of Indiana, with points Kaine had already made several times earlier in the debate. At times, Kaine simply seemed to be trying too hard.

Spot on.

But what puzzled me was Wagner’s claim that Kaine’s “image of authenticity” has been “one of his greatest strengths.” As a long time observer of Tim Kaine’s forced demeanor and attempts to fake moderation, my question is: What image of authenticity?

Wagner provides an answer late in his piece when he writes:

On the campaign trail, Kaine comes across as more authentic than Clinton, to whom many voters, including those who support her, say seems very distant.

Well, yes, Tim Kaine is authentic compared to Hillary Clinton.

Authenticity is a huge problem for Democrats. In order to impose their left-wing agenda on a centrist country, they have to pretend to uphold, at least to some degree, traditional American goals and values. And they have to hide their contempt for voters who embrace these goals and values.

In short, they have to fake authenticity.

It’s difficult for the person at the top of the ticket to accomplish this these days because he or she must win over the Democratic base during the primary season. Thus, the vice presidential nominee bears a heavy burden.

In 2004, the Democrats shot themselves in the foot by selecting John Edwards. John Kerry hoped that this smooth southerner, who made his name in the courtroom charming juries, would convincingly display the common touch. But, as even Kerry realized, Edwards was a transparent phony.

In 2008, Barack Obama made a brilliant selection in Joe Biden. Say what you want about Talkin’ Joe, and his faults are legion, he seems genuine and, for a politician, probably is.

In Tim Kaine, Hillary Clinton hoped she had a Biden with brains. But last night, Kaine was Bidenesque only in the sense that he kept interrupting his opponent.

In 2012, voters seemed mostly okay with “Uncle Joe’s” constant interruptions of Paul Ryan. With shifty Tim Kaine’s interruptions, not so much.

The Clinton-Kaine ticket was made to be defeated. With a decent Republican nominee, it would be."
100348,1009,AFTER LAST NIGHT,http://www.powerlineblog.com/archives/2016/10/after-last-night-21.php,13,"The vice-presidential debate between Senator Tim Kaine and Governor Mike Pence last night gave us two sides of Kaine: Kaine can’t and Kaine cant.

Kaine can’t say he’ll be Clinton’s right-hand man. No, he’ll be her “right-hand person.”

When it comes to men, Democrats are riding the culture wave and would prefer not to distinguish between men and women for certain purposes. Announcing himself Hillary Clinton’s right-hand man wouldn’t be prudent. It would be insensitive. It would be exclusionary. Tim Kaine loves you, in your many genders and varieties and manifestations, even if Hillary Clinton will be our first woman president and not our current presidential person.

As Clinton’s “right-hand person,” Kaine reminded me of Norman Mailer’s mocking analysis of the use of the proposed substitute for “woman” back when he was playing the villain of feminism. Feminists of the era objected to “woman” because it was derivative of “man.” They promoted the neologism “woperson.” Mailer asserted, however, that “woperson” too was objectionable, with the tinge of masculinity in “-son.” The preferable form would be “woperon.” Kaine can be Clinton’s woperon!

Kaine’s cant featured oddly timed interjections regarding Trump’s allegedly perfidious nonpayment of taxes, or something like that. I wish someone would explain that the income tax code seeks to tax income. Offsetting losses against income is basic to the operation of the income tax system. It’s not a loophole and it’s not complicated.

Kaine’s cant also featured several assertions that the Iran deal has stopped Iran’s nuclear program. As always, the Democrats seek to exploit the profound ignorance of their prospective supporters. Iran’s nuclear program not only continues, the Iran deal funds it for the indefinite future.

Kaine’s interruptions delivered a parade of Trump’s greatest hits, occasionally twisted to maximize the offense in each case. Pence mostly declined to take the bait.

Kaine must have been instructed by the Clinton team to interrupt Pence. He started at the outset and kept it up until the conclusion.

Kaine seeks to present himself as a nice guy. His performance showed him to be a phony (as he is a phony moderate). The nice guy thing is his persona; he’s a jerk following orders or simply a jerk. I’ve met a lot of politicians like him and I hate the type.

Pence presented a strong critique of Clinton on conservative grounds. He maintained his presence of mind through Kaine’s constant interruptions. He touted his own record as governor of Indiana (without objection or response). He disparaged Kaine’s record as governor of Virginia (without objection or response).

Pence sought to introduce the rather serious abuse of national security and related laws represented by Clinton’s email scandal. Pence was shut down by the moderator from CBS News. She let Kaine roll over her and otherwise made it two against one as Pence fended for himself (see Monica Sanchez/Media Research Center).

CBS News, of course, presents as an extreme case of mainstream media playing on the Democrats’ team. See, e.g., Sharyl Attkisson’s Stonewalled, her memoir recounting her career inside CBS News.

I wished Pence could make a difference in the election and I wished he were the candidate at the top of the ticket. He seemed to me to show the appeal of the conservative case against the Obama era that Clinton promises to deepen and extend.

Quotable quote (Tim Kaine, via Jim Swift/Weekly Standard): “I’m proud because [Hillary Clinton’s] vision of stronger together, building an economy that works for all, not just those at the top, being safe in the world not only with a strong military but also strong alliances to battle terrorism and climate change…”

JOHN adds: The conventional wisdom is that Mike Pence did very well, and “won” the debate handily. For what it’s worth, Frank Luntz’s focus group had Pence prevailing on a 22-4 vote. I enjoyed this mid-debate tweet by Luntz:"
100349,1010,Pence’s penchant for dodging questions isn’t poise. It’s how he defended anti-LGBT discrimination.,https://thinkprogress.org/pence-vb-debate-lgbt-style-feba3105ea85#.6zll95451,13,"The Wednesday-morning post-debate quarterbacking is well underway, and it seems many members of the punditry are giving Mike Pence credit for maintaining style and poise as Tim Kaine repeatedly laid into Donald Trump.
How quickly they forget.
If LGBT issues had come up even once, commentators might have remembered that what they were seeing was not style, but a tactic Pence has used before_—_he hears the challenging questions but doesn’t acknowledge that they’re there. Throughout the vice presidential debate, as Kaine called out Donald Trump’s offensive comments and bizarre positions, Pence would smirk and shake his head_—_in clear recognition of what had been said_—_and then proceed as if he was participating in an entirely different conversation, avoiding any accountability for the valid points made. That’s exactly how he has tried to dodge accusations that he supports discrimination against LGBT people.
Last year, Pence signed Indiana’s Religious Freedom Restoration Act (RFRA) into law. Though it was called RFRA, Indiana’s law was far more broad than laws of the same name in other states. Indiana’s differed in a way that seemed clearly designed to allow businesses and individuals to use their religious beliefs to legally justify refusing service to LGBT people. Though Pence eventually caved and approved a change to the law that clarified it could not be cited to defend discrimination, he spent a few weeks denying that discrimination was even relevant to the conversation. The clearest example of this was an infamous interview Pence gave shortly into the controversy with George Stephanopoulos. Eight different times, Stephanopoulos asked Pence directly_—_“yes or no”_—_whether the law allows for discrimination against LGBT people and whether Pence believes it should be legal to engage in such discrimination. Eight times, Pence refused to answer. It’s probably no coincidence that Kaine started similarly keeping count of the number of times that Pence refused to respond to questions about Trump’s record. “Six times tonight, I have said to Governor Pence, ‘I can’t imagine how you can defend your running mate’s position’ on one issue after the next,” he said. “And in all six cases, he’s refused to defend his running mate.”
Pence’s response was telling: “Well, let’s_—_no, no, don’t put words in my mouth.” But of course, Kaine didn’t put words in Pence’s mouth; he did the very opposite. He pointed out that no relevant words were coming out whatsoever. “And yet he is asking everybody to vote for somebody that he cannot defend,” Kaine added, twisting the knife. “And I just think that should be underlined.”
Pence’s extremist history of anti-LGBT positions is the perfect companion to Trump’s racism and misogyny. Proposing that funding for HIV/AIDS treatment should instead be diverted to harmful ex-gay therapy programs is right up there with building a wall to keep out Mexican “crime” and “rapists.” By using the exact same dodges that he used to avoid acknowledging accountability for his own record to avoid accountability for Trump’s, he actually demonstrated how culpable they both are.
And if the Pence m.o. is ignoring true statements, the Trump m.o. is denying true statements, and by the end of the debate, Pence had adopted the latter tactic. Repeatedly denying that Trump had said the things that he said in front of countless cameras, Pence descended from simply refusing to take accountability to denying that there was even any accountability to take.
Pence deserves criticism for not addressing his ticket’s record, not praise for how he did it. Lauding Pence for how well he played the part instead of scrutinizing the part itself falls into the same trap of false equivalence that has plagued this election cycle. Sure, Kaine was shouty and frequently interrupted both Pence and moderator Elaine Quijano, but at least he could defend his running mate’s record, cite actual policy proposals, and critique his opponents with verifiable facts. Pence just pretended most of the election cycle hadn’t even happened. As Jamelle Bouie pointed out at Slate, Pence may have seemed smoother, but “he used that polish and confidence to deny Trump’s rhetoric and behavior and gaslight the country that has borne witness to them. To call this winning is to act as if nothing matters.”
If theater critics want to favor Pence’s performance, that makes some sense, but anyone claiming to be a political pundit should be held to a higher standard in their analysis. This was a bigot defending a bigot, and he did so by attacking people_—_like those concerned about systemic racism in law enforcement_—_for even acknowledging that “implicit bias” might exist. Indeed, Pence and Trump, when faced with an audience not already inclined to agree with everything they say, craft a reality in which no bigotry exists_—_including their own. But theater is exactly what this illusion is."
100350,1010,Mike Pence was not interested in defending Donald Trump,https://thinkprogress.org/mike-pence-was-not-interested-in-defending-donald-trump-c13fb6399c1e#.3tvgpp3uj,13,"By all accounts, Mike Pence is running for the vice presidency on a ticket with Donald Trump. Viewers might be forgiven if they went to bed with the wrong impression after tuning into Pence’s one and only appearance on a debate stage Tuesday night, though.
Time and again, Pence was asked to defend some of his running mate’s most controversial statements and positions. And with virtually every opportunity, he instead deflected, changed the subject, or outright denied that Trump’s words were Trump’s words. Take this exchange on nuclear weapons. This past spring, Trump raised eyebrows when he suggested it was in America’s interest if more countries—like Saudi Arabia, Japan, and South Korea—began developing nuclear weapons. He also suggested that as president, he wouldn’t be opposed to using nuclear weapons in Europe.
To national security experts at the time and still today, Trump’s comments were as alarming as they were outlandish. And on Tuesday, Mike Pence sounded incredulous when Trump’s own words were essentially repeated back to him verbatim by his Democratic counterpart Tim Kaine.
“He never said that,” Pence insisted. Naturally, there is ample video evidence of Trump saying it, repeatedly.
Pence also couldn’t believe a presidential nominee would forget the fact that Russia invaded Crimea just two years ago. “Trump…didn’t know that Russia had invaded Crimea,” Kaine reminded viewers.
“He knew that,” was Pence’s chortled retort.
“He’s not going into Ukraine, OK, just so you understand,” were Donald Trump’s exact words in August, two years after Putin went into Ukraine. “He’s not going to go into Ukraine, all right? You can mark it down. You can put it down. You can take it anywhere you want.”
On immigration, on foreign policy, on national security, on taxes, on insults leveled against women, Mexicans, and Muslims; every time Kaine resurfaced one of Donald Trump’s offensive, false or incoherent quotes, Pence refused to defend his running mate.
And that may have been by design. As many commentators noted post-debate, while Kaine gave a full-throated defense of Hillary Clinton’s record at the State Department and in Congress, Pence’s primary concern on the debate stage seemed to be himself. If his aim was to lend support for Donald Trump’s policy proposals and sway undecided voters, Pence failed spectacularly.
If, however, his goal was to insulate his own political career from his highly combustable running mate, well, mission accomplished. "
100351,1010,The most honest answer in last night’s debate,https://thinkprogress.org/what-the-vice-presidential-candidates-meant-when-they-talked-about-faith-last-night-88dec3a54f97#.3zf3ny6ci,13,"Near the tail end of last night’s interruption-filled vice presidential debate between Democrat Tim Kaine and Republican Mike Pence, moderator Elaine Quijano finally waded into a topic that has received relatively little attention this election season: religion.
After noting that both men have been vocal about their deeply-held faith on the campaign trail, she asked each “to discuss, in detail, a time when you struggled to balance your personal faith and a public policy decision.”
The response to the “religion question” was one of the most honest, compelling moments of the debate, with both men affirming each other’s faith and_—_for once_—_refraining from interrupting each other. Yet their answers betrayed two very different sets of spiritual priorities, with each man appearing to use their time to court a different subset of the faithful.
“Their answers betrayed two very different sets of spiritual priorities, with each man appearing to focus on a different subset of the faithful.”
Kaine, for his part, initially name-checked his Catholic (Jesuit) education before insisting that one faith should not be lorded over another. By way of example, he explained that the most spiritually trying moment of his political career was wrestling with whether or not to support the death penalty_—_something the Catholic Church opposes in most cases.
“The hardest struggle in my faith life was the Catholic Church is against the death penalty, and so am I,” he said. “But I was governor of a state, and the state law said there was a death penalty for a crime if the jury determined them to be heinous … I looked the voters of Virginia in the eye and said, ‘Look, this is my religion—I’m not going to change my religious practice to get one vote. But I know how to take a vote and uphold the law and if you elect me I will uphold the law.’ I was elected and I did.” Kaine’s answer effectively conveyed two messages at once. First, his struggle over capital punishment, which he has mentioned before on the stump, reflects America’s own creeping ambivalence on the issue. Just last week, Pew Research announced that only 49 percent of Americans said they back executions, the first time the practice has lost majority support in more than 45 years. Feelings on the issue tend to break along religious lines: while healthy majorities of white evangelicals and white mainline Protestants support the death penalty (69 and 60 percent, respectively), only 43 percent of Catholics endorse the practice. Only a narrow majority of white Catholics (54 percent), a coveted swing vote, support the practice, and 50 percent of the religiously unaffiliated_—_a younger group that leans Democrat_—_oppose it outright.
In other words, Kaine’s agony over ordering the death of another human being is a relatively safe topic.
“I think it is really, really important that those of us who have deep faith lives don’t feel like we can just substitute our own views for everybody else in society regardless of their views.”
But the second, and arguably more important, part of Kaine’s response was how he appeared to use a traditional definition of religious liberty to slyly jab at Pence’s own, far more controversial understanding of the same concept.
“[The death penalty issue] was a struggle, but I think it is really, really important that those of us who have deep faith lives don’t feel like we can just substitute our own views for everybody else in society regardless of their views,” he said.
Kaine’s goal here is subtle, but strategic. Pence is infamous for supporting his state’s version of the “Religious Freedom Restoration Act” (RFRA) in 2015, a law many saw as a thinly-veiled attempt to discriminate against LGBT people. The governor faced a cavalcade of criticism for signing the bill, including several faith groups who said it “could provide a legal excuse for individuals and corporations to use religious conviction as a reason to discriminate”—in other words, forcing others to submit to the religious beliefs of one group.
The faith groups weren’t alone. Polls taken at the time showed that the majority of every major religious group favor legal nondiscrimination policies that protect LGBT people, and almost all opposed laws like the Indiana bill that grant religious businesses the right to refuse service to LGBT people on religious grounds. That’s a lot of potential votes.
The one exception, of course, was white evangelical Protestants—the group that backed Indiana’s “religious liberty” bill in the first place, and who Pence geared his own answer toward Tuesday night. In fact, Pence made his target audience crystal clear: conservative Christians who oppose abortion_—_especially evangelicals.
“My Christian faith is at the very heart of who I am,” he said. “With regard to when I struggle…For me the sanctity of life proceeds out of the belief, that ancient principle, where God says, ‘before you were formed in the womb, I knew you.’ … The state of Indiana has also sought to make sure that we expand alternatives in health care counseling for women; non-abortion alternatives. I’m also very please that we are are well on our way to becoming the most pro-adoption state in America. I think if you’re going to be pro-life, you should be pro-adoption.” Pence, like Kaine, was broadcasting dual messages, although they were far easier to parse. The first was plainly reiterating his opposition to abortion—a position harbored by the vast majority of evangelical Protestants, even among millennial evangelicals. The second was naming adoption as an implied alternative to abortion, an idea that has become something of an obsession among evangelicals. In fact, adoption—which is often pushed by church leaders—has become so prevalent among the right-wing Christians that it’s causing serious issues abroad, as eager parents flood international adoption agencies with requests for children.
The ultimate objective is for Pence to do exactly what most political analysts say he was tapped by Trump to do: bolster support for the GOP nominee among religious conservatives, many of whom support Trump—but only reluctantly.
So, yes, both men spoke honestly about their religious beliefs last night. They just also happened to speak about it in ways that would resonate with a very specific subset of the (voting) faithful."
100352,1001,"Donald Trump isn't just the king of debt, he's the emperor of failure",http://www.dailykos.com/stories/2016/10/06/1578432/-Donald-Trump-isn-t-just-the-king-of-debt-he-s-the-emperor-of-failure,13,"Donald Trump has been complaining that the news media is “obsessed” with tax records from the 1990s. Which, he says, “Was a long time ago.”

Of course, there’s the little detail of Trump dipping back into the 1990s, and earlier, to attack Hillary Clinton based on things her husband either did. or was rumored to have done, at the time. But there’s also the vastly larger fact that Donald Trump hasn’t released any tax records since then. In fact, we wouldn’t even have the partial 1995 taxes if someone in Trump Tower hadn’t slipped it into a mail slot at the New York Times.

When trying to evaluate Donald Trump’s claims about his wealth and fiscal prowess, there’s really no choice except to look back at those few years where his business life became public. And those records? What they show is failure after failure and Donald Trump getting bailed-out by others.

It wasn’t just 1995. ...

All of the tax information that has been publicly revealed—The Washington Post published figures for 1978 and 1979 in May, Politico reported in June he had paid no taxes in 1991 and 1993, The New York Times published 1995 information last week and further information from the 1970s show the same thing: Trump paying little or no taxes because of poor financial performance and huge mistakes he made in his business.
Every peek we have into Trump’s finances show a man who was constantly overspending, constantly making wrong bets, constantly failing — and frequently being bailed out by daddy.

When Donald Trump said he was the king of debt he was being modest. Donald Trump is the god emperor of failure.

Are you a member of MoveOn? No matter where you live, help defeat Donald Trump and take back the Senate by texting MoveOn members in swing states to knock on doors where they live.

In 1978, Trump’s father got the 33-year-old Donald a $35 million credit line for his budding real estate projects on the basis of the older Trump’s guarantee. How did that work out? It took Trump less than a year to blow through that money, through an extension, and end up begging for help.

In 1978, the same year that Fred Trump set up the credit line for his son at Chase Manhattan, Trump’s personal finances collapsed. By then, he had borrowed $38 million from his line of credit—the bank adjusted the available amount up by $3 million when Trump exceeded his credit limit. …

Unsurprisingly, given Trump’s bad business decisions, Donald’s taxes for 1978 showed personal losses of $406,379—that’s $1.5 million in present-day dollars—according to the information filed to the casino regulator. 
We can also see Trump’s 1979 taxes, where he lost the equivalent of $11 million. Bank records for the time show that Trump had nothing approaching the amount of money in reserve to deal with these losses. In fact, the total of his available assets came to about a tenth of what he reported lost in a single year. How did Donald survive?

So Trump took the same route he did for the rest of that decade and in decades to come: He borrowed more to keep himself afloat. Apparently, no bank would lend him additional amounts, so he turned to his father to rescue him. On September 24, 1980, Fred Trump arranged for a series of loans totaling $7.5 million to his son, which Donald Trump used to pay down some of the debt on his personal credit line.
Without his father’s bailout, Trump would have run himself right off the table in his thirties and still be digging out of that hole.

It’s a pattern that repeated over and over. The only difference in the 1990s bankruptcies was that Trump had by then mounted losses so large and involved so many others in his disasters, that the banks were willing to work with him to restructure the losses.

The bottom line—no pun intended—is this: Trump is not a self-made man. He is a self-made disaster who only avoided personal bankruptcy thanks to his father being there to clean up his messes. 
Trump’s pattern of borrowing to escape his current failure has been an expanding pattern. By 1995, he was down almost a billion. How much does he owe now, and who does he owe it to?

We have no way of knowing, unless Donald Trump releases his taxes."
100353,1001,Trump can't stop talking about how he's not going to talk about Bill Clinton,http://www.dailykos.com/stories/2016/10/06/1578488/-Trump-can-t-stop-talking-about-how-he-s-not-going-to-talk-about-Bill-Clinton,14,"Donald Trump continues to spend an awful lot of time talking about how he’s not going to talk about Bill Clinton:

“I want to win this election on my policies for the future, not on Bill Clinton’s past,” Trump told me via e-mail. “Jobs, trade, ending illegal immigration, veteran care, and strengthening our military is what I really want to be talking about.”
Sure, Donald. Sure that’s what you want.

The real question is, which staffer wrote that taking-the-high-road email for Trump? One who noticed how bad Trump’s poll numbers are with women, in any case."
100354,1001,Who. Owns. Donald. Trump?,http://www.dailykos.com/stories/2016/10/06/1578492/-Who-Owns-Donald-Trump#read-more,14,"Donald Trump’s initial thrust into politics was fueled by a single idea: He’s rich, can fund his own campaign, and doesn’t owe anyone. But everything we’ve learned since then shows that just the opposite is true: Donald Trump has been piling up debt for decades.

In the 1970s, he ran up a $38 million personal debt and was bailed out by his father.

In the 1990s, he racked up $1 billion in debt twice and raided his own company to enrich himself, and even then, may have needed insolvency laws to climb out of the hole he dug.

Wouldn’t it be remarkable if the tycoon, who was claiming even in his darkest days in the 1990s to be worth over $1 billion, was admitting to the IRS that he was really not just dead broke, but hugely under water? And that a special escape provision called “insolvency”—a place Trump has never publicly confessed to being—saved him a bundle in taxes?
In the 2010s … we don’t know. American banks long ago stopped dealing with Donald Trump, and for a very good reason. Those losses Trump reported in 1995? They were 2 percent of all the net operating losses reported for the entire country. Donald Trump was a one-man economic wrecking crew.

So forget looking at who has donated $2,000 to Trump’s campaign. Forget even those who gave $10,000 to some PAC. Right this moment, the Republican candidate owes someone hundreds of millions of dollars. Maybe more. So who does Trump owe? He has admitted to at least five loans of at least $50 million each, but any of those loans could be for any amount above $50 million.

Who really owns the Republican candidate for president?

The political revolution is in your backyard. On Saturday, October 8th, join Daily Kos and Democracy for America by helping a campaign in your neighborhood. Click here to find the event nearest you.

We know he owes hundreds of millions to Deutsche Bank, which itself is an enormous conflict of interest.

… the presumptive GOP nominee also has a tremendous load of debt that includes five loans each over $50 million. (The disclosure form, which presidential candidates must submit, does not compel candidates to reveal the specific amount of any loans that exceed $50 million, and Trump has chosen not to provide details.) Two of those megaloans are held by Deutsche Bank, which is based in Germany but has US subsidiaries. 
But Deutsche Bank has serious problems.

Deutsche Bank is in deep trouble. Its stock price has plummeted in recent days after the Justice Department demanded the gigantic German bank pay $14 billion to settle claims regarding its sale of bad mortgage-backed securities in the the run-up to the 2008 financial crisis. The bank's shares fell to a new low on Tuesday over reports it might be seeking a bailout from the German government—which Deutsche Bank has denied. 
Which puts Donald Trump into the position of being in debt to a foreign institution by a minimum of $100 million when that institution has been caught hiding data, manipulating markets, and trying to evade laws aimed at preventing just the kind of mess Deutsche Bank has created.

And then there's Russia. Donald Trump can easily claim that he has “zero investments in Russia.” It may even be true. But it’s dead certain that Russia has investments in Trump.

The most obvious example is Trump Soho, a complicated web of financial intrigue that has played out in court. A lawsuit claimed that the business group, Bayrock, underpinning Trump Soho was supported by criminal Russian financial interests. While its initial claim absolved Trump of knowledge of those activities, Trump himself later took on the group’s principal partner as a senior adviser in the Trump organization.

“Tax evasion and money-laundering are the core of Bayrock’s business model,” the lawsuit said of the financiers behind Trump Soho.
And, according to Junior Trump, that’s far from the limit of Russian involvement.

“Russians make up a pretty disproportionate cross-section of a lot of our assets,” Trump’s son, Donald Jr., told a real estate conference in 2008, according to an account posted on the website of eTurboNews, a trade publication. “We see a lot of money pouring in from Russia.”
German banksters. Russian Oligarchs. Who else owns Donald Trump?

On the campaign trail, Donald J. Trump, the Republican presidential nominee, has sold himself as a businessman who has made billions of dollars and is beholden to no one. …

an office building on Avenue of the Americas in Manhattan, of which Mr. Trump is part owner, carries a $950 million loan. Among the lenders: the Bank of China, one of the largest banks in a country that Mr. Trump has railed against as an economic foe of the United States, and Goldman Sachs, a financial institution he has said controls Hillary Clinton, the Democratic nominee, after it paid her $675,000 in speaking fees.
The Bank of China. Goldman Sachs. And who else? You can’t find out by just looking at the documents Trump filed with the FEC.

The Times found three other instances in which Mr. Trump had an ownership interest in a building but did not disclose the debt associated with it. In all three cases, Mr. Trump had passive investments in limited liability companies that had borrowed significant amounts of money.
Donald Trump’s business ties are a nest of people to whom he owes vast sums of money. Those are the people Trump is responsible to. The people at the top of his list.

Far from being “beholden to no one,” Donald Trump is the most indebted candidate to ever run for president. By far. No one has to worry about any money he might take as part of the campaign. Because no one could possibly contribute enough to come close to the amount owed to the people who already own Donald Trump.

100355,1002,Florida Polls Show Statistical Tie In Presidential Race,http://www.breitbart.com/big-government/2016/10/06/florida-polls-show-statistical-tie-in-presidential-race/,14,"The two most recent Florida polls describe a statistical tie in the presidential race, with Donald Trump ahead by 1 point according to Emerson College, while Hillary Clinton leads by 3 in the University of North Florida survey.
The Emerson College poll ran from October 2 to October 4, while UNF had a longer period of September 27 through October 4. The first presidential debate was held on September 26. The two polls had roughly comparable sample sizes (600 respondents for Emerson, 696 for UNF) and similar margins of error (plus or minus 3.6 percent and 3.8 percent, respectively.)

Emerson has the race at Trump 45 percent, Clinton 44 percent in Florida, while Trump’s erstwhile GOP primary competitor Marco Rubio leads Democratic challenger Patrick Murphy by 47 to 39 in the Senate race.

Curiously, Emerson finds Clinton slightly ahead among Florida independents (40 to 39), a group where Trump leads in many other surveys, but Trump still has a 1-point lead overall. Clinton leads 59 percent to 36 percent among Hispanics, and 77 percent to 18 percent among black voters.

Third-party candidates Gary Johnson and Jill Stein were included in the Emerson survey, but were not major factors, drawing 4 percent and 2.6 percent respectively. Just 4 percent of respondents said they were undecided.
 In a two-way race, UNF finds Clinton’s lead expanding beyond the margin of error to 7 points: Clinton 47, Trump 40.

“The size of Clinton’s lead drops when the additional candidates (Johnson and Stein) are listed in the question. This suggests that the Clinton campaign should perhaps perceive Johnson as a threat, who is taking more votes from her than Trump,” said poll director Dr. Michael Binder, who thought his survey showed Clinton getting a significant bounce after the first presidential debate.

“While neither candidate has high favorability for the majority of likely voters in Florida, Clinton’s net negative 9 percent is better than Trump’s net negative 23 percent,” Binder added. However, a slightly higher percentage of Trump’s voters said they were primarily voting against Clinton (46 percent) than Clinton voters said they were voting against Trump (43 percent.)

Binder noted the UNF poll also found that “for all of the talk about deportation and ‘building walls’, majorities of Democrats, NPAs and even Republicans in Florida are supportive of pathways to citizenship for undocumented immigrants.”

More specifically, the most popular option for illegal immigrants was “Allow them to stay in the U.S. and eventually qualify for U.S. citizenship after paying back taxes and fines” with 49, followed by “Allow them to stay in the U.S. and eventually qualify for U.S. citizenship without penalties” at 21.

Immigration was the fourth-most pressing concern for Florida voters in the UNF poll at 7 percent, behind jobs and the economy (27), education (10), and health care (8).
As for the University of North Florida poll, it found Clinton leading in Florida by 41 to Trump’s 38 in a four-way race. Johnson and Stein were bigger players in this poll, pulling 6 and 3."
100356,1002,Al Gore Declares Climate War on Donald Trump,http://www.breitbart.com/london/2016/10/06/al-gore-declares-climate-war-on-donald-trump/,14,"Hillary Clinton’s chances of becoming next U.S. President took a major hit this week as rumours strengthened that Al Gore will be supporting her campaign.
According to WaPo:

The decision by Gore to plunge into the campaign during the final weeks shows the extent to which Democrats remain concerned that Clinton has yet to connect with many millennials, some of whom are backing third-party candidates this year. The former vice president, a climate activist, will speak about not just Clinton’s plan to address global warming, but also the idea that voting for an independent presidential candidate could deliver the White House to Republicans in the same way that Ralph Nader’s candidacy helped undermine his presidential bid in 2000.

Well, perhaps. An alternative possibility is that Gore’s intervention will focus voters’ attention on one of Hillary’s biggest weaknesses: her dedication to an anti-science, anti-human, anti-free-markets ideology which, in defiance of reason or evidence, seeks to hamstring U.S. industry and punish consumers in the name of dealing with a non-existent problem.

Make no mistake, environmentalism is one of the clearest and most important points of difference between the two main presidential candidates.

Under a Hillary presidency, green crony capitalism will flourish: the corrupt, meddling, dishonest Environmental Protection Agency will grow more powerful and intrusive; activist groups like the Sierra Club and The Nature Conservancy will grow more shrill and demanding in their war on freedom and property rights; fossil fuel producers (coal especially) will be punished while more taxpayers’ money will be squandered on subsidising bat-chomping, bird-slicing eco-crucifixes and other “clean energy” ventures; regulations on everything from zoning to agricultural land-use to clean air will grow more stringent; enviro-capitalist cronies like Tom Steyer will be enriched; energy intensive industries will be punished; consumers will be hit in the pocket.

Under a Trump presidency, the green blob will be slain causing massive – but necessary – stock market disruption as the entire, Enron-inspired green Ponzi scheme unravels and the Augean stables containing three or four decades’ worth of environmentalist ordure are finally swept clean.

Which, of course, is one reason why the liberal media – which for years has been unquestioningly pushing the green narrative without doing any due diligence as to its accuracy – is having such conniptions at the prospect of a Trump victory. According to this WaPo editorial, Trump will cue the arrival of the Four Horsemen of the Apocalypse, at the very least.

It took global negotiators a quarter-century to strike the Paris climate agreement, an international accord aimed at slowing global warming. The agreement represents the best hope for a world in which no one country acting alone can do enough to fight this global threat. Donald Trump could destroy the agreement with a stroke of a pen, and with it any hope that the world will keep the planet’s temperature within the boundaries scientists say are safe.

The Paris deal represents a major U.S. commitment, but it is not a treaty with the force of law. President Obama submitted the U.S. emissions goal; Mr. Trump could withdraw it just as easily. He also could deeply undercut or eliminate the basis for any future U.S. commitment. Mr. Trump has promised to rescind the Clean Power Plan, which obliges electrical utilities to reduce their greenhouse-gas emissions by cutting down on coal burning and increasing their use of natural gas and renewables. The Environmental Protection Agency drew up the plan using authorities that Congress gave it decades ago in the Clean Air Act. Mr. Trump could press the agency to revoke it or water it down.

Mr. Trump also would have considerable sway over the state of the nation’s land and water. He has promised to use that power to quash regulations on drilling and to open federal lands to coal, oil and gas production. He could do more; for example, he could attempt to use executive discretion over drilling royalties, pipeline construction, permitting, drilling leases, oil and gas exports, and other matters to reward firms and people he likes or to punish those he does not.

All this is true, but in a good way. Withdrawing from the Paris climate agreement, though it would largely be a symbolic gesture because the agreement is not legally binding and therefore meaningless, would represent a bravura act of trolling; but rescinding the Clean Power Plan would cut costs to business and benefit consumers, while opening up federal lands to the oil and gas industries would drastically increase the fracking boom which has brought America prosperity and increased energy independence.

Those who worry about the environmental costs should be aware that the EPA’s clean air policies are a) based on the junkiest of rigged junk science and b) that the difference it makes to “global warming” – if any – will be immeasurably small. By the end of the century, Bjorn Lomborg has calculated, America’s Clean Power Plan will reduce the world’s increase in temperatures by a spectacular 0.004 degrees C. Yes, that’s four thousandths of a degree!"
100357,1002,Trump New Voter Registration Soars: 2 Million Door Knocks in a Week and a Half,http://www.breitbart.com/2016-presidential-race/2016/10/06/trump-new-voter-registration-soars-2-million-door-knocks-in-a-week-and-a-half/,14,"Pro-Trump Republicans knocked on two million doors in the last week and a half and are putting up massive new voter registration numbers.
The hurricane in Florida slowed door knocking efforts but the phone game there is still strong and the ground game is not expected to miss a beat once the weather conditions improve. In Pennsylvania, heavy rains did not stop the Trump force from knocking on 100,000 doors in one day alone.

The Republican National Committee provided new voter registration numbers to Breitbart News:

Florida Net:  +261,715
Iowa Net:  +38,913
Nevada Net:  +12,720
North Carolina Net:  +173,785
Pennsylvania Net:  +223,552
The Pennsylvania number is especially significant. Republicans signed up 30,000 people there in September alone. The Trump campaign in Pennsylvania is fired up but did not want to go on record at this time, in part because Generals MacArthur and Patton would not telegraph to the enemy their next moves.

Absentee ballot requests are going up for the GOP

Florida: 335,000 more requests for absentee ballots among Republicans

Iowa: The Iowa Trump Train is going day by day with their number collecting. On Wednesday, Republicans put in 5,000 more requests for absentee ballots than Democrats, who are seeing a 51 percent drop in their ballot requesting numbers.Michigan: Republicans are beating Democrats in absentee ballot requests by 59,000. Republicans are leading the daily race by 1,642 ballot requests per day over the last two weeks.

North Carolina: Republicans are beating Democrats by 1,902 ballot requests in the last three days, pointing to hopeful signs in the immediate future.

Pennsylvania: Republicans are losing to Democrats in absentee ballot requests by less than 1,000, but Republicans have “posted gains 11 of the past 14 days,” according to the RNC."
100358,1003,Trump’s Lounge Act Grows Stale,http://www.huffingtonpost.com/richard-j-rosendall/trumps-lounge-act-grows-s_b_12308440.html?utm_hp_ref=politics,14,"He isn’t taking on Washington, he’s taking on reality.

Sometimes a politician rises not despite his pathologies, but because they suit the moment. Donald Trump’s vulgarity, crude insults, and braggadocio fired the resentments of Republican primary voters and rode them to the nomination. His racism and sexism were not a problem with them. He read the room, as a performer would say, and gave it what it wanted. His diehards thought they were his accomplices, though they were his marks.

Seasons and audiences change. The trash talk that got Trump attention in the noisy lounge of the primaries does not work in the main room of the general election. I owe this metaphor to Rev. Al Sharpton, who learned about performance venues long ago from singer James Brown and shared it with Washington Post opinion writer Jonathan Capehart last year. But Sharpton, like most in the commentariat, thought Trump’s act wouldn’t work at all in a presidential campaign. He told Capehart, “You can’t talk about [John] McCain like you’re talking about the real estate guy bidding against you for a building in downtown Brooklyn.”

In fact, that kind of talk took Trump a long way. He had his finger on the pulses of the nation’s demons of intolerance and know-nothingism. They carried him into a virtual dead heat with the Democratic nominee.

Trump’s lounge magician act has entertained us daily with his denials of having said things that we have on tape, and with his echolalia, where he repeats a falsehood as if saying it three times makes it three times more true. He magically raises the crime rate, unemployment rate, and budget deficit by lying about them, similar to the way he erases business debts by declaring bankruptcy. He regards himself as genetically superior to harder working and less rapacious citizens while proudly contributing nothing to the federal treasury.

He promises to destroy ISIS, restore lost industrial jobs (which were exported by people like him), end crime, and return us to the white old days, by the sheer force of his personality, or a triumph of the will.

Trump is not taking on Washington, he is taking on reality. In his world, you don’t have to prepare for a debate, study the issues, or remember what you said yesterday. His supporters prefer vague, sweeping promises without a plan over the hard work of creating change. Instead of blaming Washington gridlock on Republican obstruction, blame both parties equally. Mock knowledge and experience as elitist. Recruit old men on their third wives as surrogates, since families are great and those guys started as many as they could.

Trump miscalculated in thinking his improvisation would work in the fall as it had in the spring. On September 26, he met Hillary Clinton on the debate stage. Unlike him, she had prepared. She brought the toughness and seasoning of experience. While he took every bit of bait she tossed his way, she let his insults roll off her. As he wilted, she shone.

For several days following the debate, Trump worsened his wounds by defaming a Latina former beauty queen Clinton mentioned whom he had insulted twenty years before. He doubled down on his increasingly desperate mockery of Clinton’s alleged lack of stamina. But his trash talk about women being fat pigs, and his boasting about stiffing contractors and paying no taxes, are no match for the political heavyweight he now faces.

Trump does not learn from his mistakes because he refuses to admit he made them. By contrast, Hillary listens to people, and has the discipline to ignore the mockery while pursuing a campaign strategy.

None of this is to suggest the campaign is over. As I write this, five long weeks remain until Election Day. Republican dirty trickster Roger Stone is warning of dire revelations. Republicans persist in their voter suppression efforts despite adverse court orders. But, amazingly enough, there is also something called journalism being done. The New York Times late last week reported on tax documents it received that showed Trump declared $916 million in losses for 1995. His loudly proclaimed business acumen has devolved into success at writing off mammoth losses as tax deductions.

The election remains too close to call. Go to your battle stations."
100359,1003,Hillbilly Shuffle: Don’t Blame Appalachia For Trump,http://www.huffingtonpost.com/jeff-biggers/hillbilly-shuffle-dont-bl_b_12380654.html?utm_hp_ref=politics,14,"The phenomenon of Donald Trump’s presidential campaign, we’ve been told for months in the media, has been fueled by the coal-fired alienation and anger of the nation’s working-class whites. Appalachia, more than any other region, has been targeted as ground zero. And J.D. Vance’s best-selling and heartfelt memoir, Hillbilly Elegy, has been held up by conservative and liberal reviewers alike as “a Tough Love Analysis of the Poor Who Back Trump.”

Well, sorry, but just as there is no reason to deny the Republican stronghold in the region, outsider observers need to look beyond default stereotypes for some sort of tidy explanation for today’s electorate.

Don’t blame hillbillies for Trump.

For every “hillbilly elegy,” there is a hillbilly paean, or a “Higher Ground,” in the words of a Harlan County theatre troupe, which puts local voices on stage to grapple with the stories of addiction, abuse and jobs.

The media, on the other hand, and its hype over Trump, has missed the real humanitarian crises of power and powerlessness in Appalachia, and an unacknowledged assault by absentee coal companies and pharmaceutical companies on its residents, instead relying on breathless and uninformed proclamations on “hillbilly culture” that simply rehash the old stereotypes that have dogged the region for centuries.

And media hype it is: The American Conservative christened Trump “the tribune of poor white people.” Slightly more moderate, the Christian Science Monitor pointed out the “deeper rebellion” of Appalachian whites joining the insurgent Trump campaign, in search of a political vehicle for their “desperate sadness.” News outlets like CNN have showcased America’s “forgotten tribe,” suddenly left behind in the “war on coal,” and abandoned to the long black veil of racism, drug addiction, abuse, multi-generational poverty and gun-toting fatalism. In its glowing review of Hillbilly Elegy, The New Yorker asked: “Why is the hillbilly culture so defensive, insular, and frozen in time?”

Well, it ain’t. And for anyone who has done more than an hour’s worth of research, it hasn’t been for a century. In 1932, federal surveyors begged Washington policymakers to “revise old ideas” of Appalachia as a static region, and recognize its “rapid transformation” and upheaval from outside industries.

Instead of derision or finger-wagging accusation, it’s time our nation pays its debt to Appalachia, and places the diverse region in the forefront of regeneration and a new economy.

“Appalachia has given more than can be counted to the nation at large,” 9th-generation West Virginia-based radio commentator Bob Kincaid told me. “It’s time the nation gave back and with no strings attached and no talk of our own bootstraps, which, for all intents and purposes, we boiled and ate a couple of generations back.”

To claim Trump has uniquely galvanized a working-class white electorate by tapping into its bitter political alienation disregards two centuries of historical clashes—and a never-ending hillbilly trope of backwardness by the media since the British Crown warned about the “dangerous” backwater people in the Appalachian mountains before the American Revolution.

Far from a singular tribe in a single place, Appalachia is a vast region, stretching over 13 states. It’s our nation’s most conflicted region, a crossroads of cultures, with black and white cultures so entangled that a country song can be traced to a minstrel or blues origin. The region has been the frontlines of industrial shift and disenfranchisement and political conflict for centuries—and every wealthy and powerful politician has attempted to exploit it, from the “log cabin and a hard cider” slogan of wealthy presidential candidate William Henry Harrison in 1840, to President Ronald Reagan, who won West Virginia by a landslide in 1984 with the upbeat campaign slogan, “It’s Morning Again in America.”

Another Appalachia—-or several other Appalachias—is waiting to be discovered by the media or children of the diaspora, like Vance or myself, who appear every election to pass judgment on the region’s ills without any sense of the historical context of the region.

And these “other Appalachias” have been waiting a long time: Today’s election stories on Appalachia’s “war on coal” and entrenched poverty largely replay stereotypes of “Yesterday’s People,” the textbook manual of blame on some cultural deficiency of poor whites in the 1960s, still overlooking the boom-bust realities of absentee-owned extraction industries and their stranglehold over the development of the region.

Despair, hopelessness, fatalism—yeah, Appalachia and Greater Appalachia and rural America, in general, have amassed their share of these traits in abundance. And not by accident. When my Mom lived in a log cabin without water and electricity in southern Illinois, the mined-out and deforested region was described as a place of “utter hopelessness” in a report, Seven Stranded Coal Towns.

The historical trauma is real. There’s blood on our mountains.

“Sitting here in the midst of the collapse, I’m trying to figure out how to get around the usual dreck that surrounds any discussion of Appalachia,” Kincaid said, from a family of coal miners and long-time activists against mountaintop removal mining. “It comes not only from the “outsiders,” but from inside, as well; not only from the pro-coal forces, but from our own forces (such as they are) opposing them. It’s as if we don’t know how to be anything but what we’ve been told we are. To see in John Fox, Jr.’s “Trail of the Lonesome Pine” a vision of a before-the-fall Appalachia, then to consider what came next and then to look at Google Earth and see the ossified remains of that area he described as “Edenic” and know it’s only going to get worse absent profound and brilliant change is to serve as witness to a funeral after an execution by drawing and quartering.”

Kincaid, like so many other Appalachians, has been fighting back for decades.

For every Trump supporter blaming President Obama with the faux “war on coal” slogan, we need commentators and reviewers to point out that Vance’s native homeland in eastern Kentucky lost nearly 70% of their coal jobs to mechanization (mountaintop removal strip mines) in the three decades before President Obama came to power. That coal states and coal companies have been found guilty in court of violating basic clean water mine laws; that the rates of birth defects and cancer have skyrocketed in strip mining areas; and, that mine unions have collapsed over the past decade, shattering any fabric of tight communities.

That people are dying from cancer-related diseases from mountaintop removal in central Appalachia, thanks to a regulatory policy that turns a blind eye to an outlaw coal industry.

For every heartbreaking story of addiction, in Appalachia, we need commentators and reviewers to note that the makers of OxyContin (referred to as “hillbilly heroin”) pleaded guilty in 2007 to falsely marketing a drug that has ravaged the region.

For every “face of poverty“ in the media, like Sabrina Shrader in after her 2013 state legislature testimony on her own hunger, you have a emerging Sabrina Shrader that was inspired by Bernie Sanders’ campaign, and has now become a leader of Our Children Our Future Campaign, and a candidate for the West Virginia House of Delegates.

For every non-union coal miner waiting for Trump to bring back a declining industry, a recent poll found that two-thirds of Appalachian voters believe elected officials should focus on attracting new industries into former coal towns. Republicans and Democrats alike have joined to pass the RECLAIM ACT to provide $1 billion in funds for economic diversification programs in coal country.

Courageous Appalachians living in the ruins of mountainntop removal have never given up their struggle for civil rights and health justice, still campaigning daily for the Appalachian Community Health Emergency Act.

For every Mountain Dew-swigging mother, as the caricature is often trotted out in news program, legions of folks are reviving a local food economy; Hazard hosted the Big Ideas Fest for Appalachia: Visionary Thinking and Doing, examining high tech options, including NASA satellites. Retired eastern Kentucky coal miners like Carl Shoupe and Stanley Sturgill are fighting mountaintop removal operations and leading energy efficiency employment projects, while others pursue reforestation and hemp efforts, and new groups like Accelerating Appalachia are launching regenerative economic solutions in the region.

It’s an old story, actually, this hillbilly shuffle.

For every “Sut Lovingood,” the “darn fool” with his “brains unhooked” in the New York newspapers in the 1850s, there has been an Appalachian writer like Rebecca Harding, who published the first fiction of white working class and immigrant realities in The Atlantic Monthly in 1861, or today’s Affrilachian (African American Appalachia) poet laureate of Kentucky, Frank X. Walker, bestselling novelists like Ron Rash and Denise Giardina, or feminist and renowned author like bell hooks.

For every racist swinging that Confederate flag—and there are many—we need teachers to remind us that Black History Month emerged from West Virginian historian and coal miner Carter Woodson, and Appalachia produced the 19th Century’s defining black nationalist Martin Delany, as well as blues, jazz and rock icons like Bessie Smith, Nina Simone and Bill Withers. 

“You can’t understand America until you understand Appalachia,” Don West, a labor organizer told me, as we visited poor families near abandoned coal mines in McDowell County in the early1980s.

West had cofounded the Highlander Folk School in eastern Tennessee, which trained the shock troops of the Civil Rights Movement and inspired Rosa Parks, four months before the Montgomery Bus Boycott in 1955. Parks said her visit among hillbilly organizers was the first time she found white people she could trust.

I’m not sure who we can trust today, but I do know you can’t understand the rise of Donald Trump, by simply blaming the hillbilly."
100360,1003,Letter to Hillary Clinton,http://www.huffingtonpost.com/evaggelos-vallianatos/letter-to-hillary-clinton_b_12301950.html?utm_hp_ref=politics,14,"Dear Mrs. Clinton,

I plan to vote for you. I am confident you will be the next president of the United States.

Your opponent, Donald Trump, is not fit to be president. He is wasting his time thinking he can bamboozle millions of Americans with gimmicks of playboy memories fuelled by hubris and deceit. He is proud for not paying taxes, a shameless and irresponsible habit.

I do support your social and political proposals for alleviating poverty and lessening the gross inequity of wealth and income in this country. I worry, however, about the future of our society in the midst of ceaseless destruction of the natural world. The fact is our health, prosperity, and survival depend on a healthy natural world.

Global warming is a product of thoughtless and dangerous human dependence on fossil fuels. A warming planet is already responsible for devastations all over the world. As long as the petroleum, coal, and natural gas industries are being subsidized and unregulated, it’s only a matter of time before the current sporadic natural disasters become frequent and catastrophic.

In addition to the outright threat of climate change, there’s the decades-old but invisible destabilizing impact of industrialized agriculture and food. More than any other single threat and, to some degrees, similar to the threat of nuclear bombs, the pesticides of the farmers represent a daily risk to all life, including human life. They have been contaminating the food and possibly drinking water of most Americans.

Pesticides are deleterious petrochemicals related to nerve poisons of WWII.

I learned about the toxicity of pesticides and industrialized farming during my 25-year career with the US Environmental Protection Agency. I also discovered the EPA is nothing but an industry subsidiary protecting the legal and financial interests of the chemical and agribusiness industries.

I am not exaggerating. I documented the hazards of pesticides and the politicization of EPA in my 2014 book, “Poison Spring: The Secret History of Pollution and the EPA” (Bloomsbury Press). The facts supporting my story came from EPA documents.

I recommend the first thing you do in the White House is to revamp both the US Department of Agriculture and the EPA, reconstituting them to serve all of us by serving small family farmers and rural America. No more water or financial subsidies to large producers. No more toxic pesticides. No more the genetic alteration of crops or GMOs. No more lobbyists surrounding USDA and EPA. No more animal factories polluting the environment and warming the Earth.

Industrialized agriculture, run on petroleum, emits a substantial amount of all global warming gases.

The connection of industrialized farming to global warming alone makes it imperative that it be radically transformed to small-scale family farming. The land of small non-industrialized farms sequesters carbon dioxide.

In addition, consider the epidemics of cancer and neurological diseases afflicting America. Pesticides are the big elephant behind these waves of debilitating illnesses, especially mental impairment in children. Consider also that pesticides are decimating wildlife for several decades. They are a powerful factor in the current sixth mass extinction.

Second and equally serious, the rapid loss of crop genetic diversity is primarily the result of the industrialization of agriculture. Cary Fowler, an American agronomist who inspired the building of the Svalbard Global Seed Vault in Norway near the North Pole, and author of the 2016 book, “Seeds on Ice,” equates the effects of the continuing loss of crop diversity to the potential effects of nuclear war and global warming.

This means America has to return to family farming that served the country well for two centuries. This means the land grant universities must also return to their original mission of inventing and supporting agroecological farming science and technologies for the benefic and prosperity of family farmers and rural America.

Instead of hard petrochemicals, farmers will use biological, cultural, and mechanical means of pest control. Integrating animals and crops will do much to diminish most synthetic fertilizers. Organic farmers have been raising food without synthetic pesticides, synthetic fertilizers or the genetic engineering of crops.

These reforms promise an easier transition to renewable energy and taming of the beast of climate change.

Rural America will also benefit immensely. Millions of small family farmers are likely to replace the current undemocratic plantation economy of a few crops, gigantic machinery, slaughterhouses, animal farms, and fertilizer and pesticide plants."
100361,1004,Trump Has A History Of Politicizing Election-Season Hurricanes,http://talkingpointsmemo.com/livewire/trump-politicizing-hurricanes-tweets,14,"Rush Limbaugh said on his radio show this week that liberals are using Hurricane Matthew to ""sell"" the threat of climate change to the general public. He's not the only suspicious one: Hurricanes apparently bring out the conspiracy theorist in Donald Trump, too.

After Hurricane Sandy slammed into the northeast a week before the 2012 presidential election, Trump tweeted that Obama would leverage federal disaster relief to ""buy the election"": He also seized the opportunity to extend his ""offer"" to Obama: $5 million to the President’s charity of choice if he released his college and passport applications and records. Trump had already seen the president’s short- and long-form birth certificates, although both failed to end his years-long birther crusade, which he only renounced in a 30-second statement last month. Trump's Sandy-related tweets continued for days, alternately targeting Democrats for allegedly politicizing the storm, and then politicizing it himself: He'd also criticized Obama in October 2012 for not granting federal funds in the relief effort after Hurricane Isaac passed over Florida that August, calling Obama's speech critical of George W. Bush after Hurricane Katrina ""racist"":Ahead of Hurricane Matthew's landfall in Florida, Trump's lone storm-related tweet was much more reserved. ""Praying for everyone in Florida,"" he tweeted Thursday. ""Hoping the hurricane dissipates, but in any event, please be careful.""

Neither Trump nor his campaign have commented on the Clinton campaign’s decision to postpone advertisements in Florida on stations broadcasting the Weather Channel."
100362,1004,Bill O'Reilly Trumpets Yet Another Of His Voter Fraud 'Investigations',http://talkingpointsmemo.com/livewire/oreilly-voter-fraud-investigation,14,"When Bill O’Reilly presents an investigation on ""voter fraud"" Thursday night, it won’t be nearly the first time the Fox News star has commented on the otherwise minuscule problem.

O’Reilly has regularly exaggerated the threat of so-called voter fraud, and downplayed the adverse effects of placing more restrictions on voting, as the liberal watchdog group Media Matters for America has documented.

In August, when Donald Trump was in the early stages of sowing doubt about the integrity of this year’s presidential election results, he went on O’Reilly’s show and estimated that without new voter identification laws, “they're going to vote 10 times,” a wild assertion that went unchallenged by O’Reilly.

Barely two weeks later, O’Reilly invited lawyers and Fox News presenters Kimberly Guilfoyle and Stacy Schneider to discuss voter fraud, which they said was exceedingly rare. “There is no statistical evidence of systematic voter fraud in presidential elections,” Schneider said.

“But what about the reports in Philadelphia that nobody voted for Romney?” O’Reilly interjected, referring to the 2012 presidential election, in which there were no votes for the Republican nominee in 59 voting divisions of Pennsylvania’s most populous city – ripe fodder for conspiracy theorists.

Guilfoyle and Schneider told him his suspicions were probably misguided: Philadelphia is a heavily Democratic city, and that Romney received no votes wasn't as shocking as O'Reilly had implied.

Just days earlier, Trump told a rally in Altoona, Pennsylvania, “We’re going to watch” the state, which polls showed at the time favored Hillary Clinton by a sizable margin. “Go down to certain areas to watch and study and make sure other people don’t come in and vote five times,” Trump said.

In fact, O’Reilly had already “investigated” the 2012 results in Philadelphia, a week after Election Day. He invited on Megan Kelly, also an attorney, to discuss the vote. She, too, confirmed that nothing unusual happened in Philadelphia.

""Same thing happened to McCain!"" Kelly said, before clarifying that in 2008, John McCain hadn't received a single vote in 57 voting divisions, while Romney had struck out in 59.

Most recently, responding to the Supreme Court’s decision not to accept a case that might have protected Ohio’s “Golden Week” of voter registration, O’Reilly lauded the decision, saying, “every African American I know has an ID!”

The Brennan Center for Justice describes the problem of voter fraud as ""very rare,"" and the type of voter impersonation that new voter ID laws would address as ""nearly non-existent."""
100363,1004,Trump: My Past Insults About Women Were All For ‘Entertainment’,http://talkingpointsmemo.com/livewire/trump-says-he-insulted-women-entertainment,14,"Donald Trump on Wednesday chalked up his long history of making insulting comments about women to “entertainment.”

""A lot of that was done for the purpose of entertainment,” the Republican nominee told Las Vegas’ KSNV-TV. “I can tell you this: There is nobody — nobody — that has more respect for women than I do.”

Asked about his habit of rating women on a scale from 1-10 and criticizing their bodies, Trump attributed his comments to his public persona as host of NBC’s “Apprentice.”

“You know, you’re in the entertainment business. You’re doing ‘The Apprentice.’ You have one of the top shows on television. And you say things differently for a reason,” Trump said.

Though he assured KSNV reporter Jim Snyder that it would be “easy” for him to tone down those remarks, the real estate mogul’s gendered criticisms have endured long into his presidential campaign.

During the 2016 race, Trump has hinted that Fox News host Megyn Kelly treated him unfriendly because there was “blood coming out of her wherever,” called Kelly a bimbo, and mocked the appearance of Sen. Ted Cruz’s (R-TX) wife.

As recently as last week, Trump went on a tear against former Miss Universe Alicia Machado, who he previously called “Miss Piggy” and “Miss Housekeeping” for gaining “a massive amount of weight” after winning her title. He also targeted Hillary Clinton for her husband’s extramarital affairs.

Trump’s suggestion that he only made derogatory comments about women to bolster his public image as a billionaire playboy also contradict a slew of recent news reports about how he treated women in private.

In an Associated Press investigation out this week, over 20 people who worked on “The Apprentice” described Trump’s inappropriate behind-the-scenes behavior, which included making lewd comments about a camerawoman who he said reminded him of his eldest daughter, frequently remarking on staffers' bodies, and requesting that one contestant twirl before him so he could look at her figure."
100364,1005,Donald Trump's Anti-ISIS Plan Is the Same as...Obama's and Clinton's,http://www.motherjones.com/politics/2016/10/donald-trump-anti-isis-plan-same-as-obama-clinton,14,"During the vice presidential debate on Tuesday night, when the subject turned to foreign policy, Trump campaign HQ zapped out a press release headlined, ""Donald J. Trump's Plan to Defeat ISIS and Make America Safe Again."" This was curious, because throughout his presidential bid, Trump has proclaimed that he has a ""secret"" plan for defeating the murderous Islamic extremist group that controls parts of Iraq and Syria. He has refused to reveal it, claiming that would tip off the enemy. But he has also promised that in the first 30 days of a Trump administration, he would ask the generals for an anti-ISIS plan. Which is confusing because he has also said he knows more about ISIS than the generals and that he would fire most of the generals. Still, at the same time, Trump brags that he does have his own plan that he can share publicly. That's what he sent out and what's posted on his campaign website. Yet here's one big rub: It's essentially the same plan as President Barack Obama's and Hillary Clinton's.

In the press release, Trump presented his plan in three main points:

Work with our Arab allies and friends in the Middle East so they can lead the fight against the Islamic State
Aggressively pursue joint and coalition military operations to crush and destroy ISIS, coordinate international cooperation to cut off their funding, expand intelligence sharing, and engage in cyberwarfare to disrupt and disable their propaganda and recruiting
Defeat the ideology of radical Islamic terrorism, just as we did in order to win the Cold War

Work with Arab allies and friends in the Middle East? That's what's already happening. One of the main forces combating ISIS is the Iraqi military, which the United States has been supporting for years. And the Obama administration has been working with Iraqi militias, other nations in the region, and the Kurds to beat back ISIS.

Aggressively pursue joint and military operations? Check. As of late July, the Obama administration in conjunction with its partners in the region had conducted nearly 14,000 airstrikes against ISIS. There are airstrikes on a daily basis in Iraq and Syria, and Obama has extended the campaign into Libya. Numerous top-level ISIS commanders have been killed (and so have civilians). The United States and other nations have also attempted to block ISIS oil trading and to cut off funding to the terrorist organization—with some limited success. The Obama administration has indeed tried to counter ISIS propaganda online and off in order to counter the spread of ISIS's ideology. But this has proved to be a tough task.

The only unique action that Trump calls for as part of his strategy to vanquish ISIS is declaring ""radical Islamic terrorism"" the enemy—that is, a rhetorical flourish. This is a conservative/Republican talking point, but it means little in practical terms. The main players in the region with which the United States is partnering are Islamic governments. Declaring a war on anything Islamic is not likely to enhance those alliances necessary for confronting ISIS on the ground. As part of the plan he touted on Tuesday night, Trump also calls for ""new screening procedures"" for immigrants from ""volatile regions of the world that have a history of exporting terrorism."" Whatever the merits of this move, it would not affect the effort to break ISIS's strongholds in Iraq, Syria, and Libya. Ditto for the provision in Trump's proposal to establish a ""Commission on Radical Islam to identify and explain to the American public the core convictions and beliefs of Radical Islam."" (By the way, a decade ago, Trump called for a quick pullout of US troops from Iraq, saying he didn't care if this would lead to an increase in bloodshed and terrorism.)

The core of Trump's plan for blasting ISIS is exactly what's already underway—and it's also what Hillary Clinton proposes.

On Clinton's website, she outlines her approach for kicking ISIS in the teeth. It includes ""intensifying the coalition air campaign against ISIS fighters, leaders, and infrastructure; stepping up support for local Arab and Kurdish forces on the ground; and pursuing a diplomatic strategy aimed at resolving Syria's civil war and Iraq's sectarian conflict between Sunnis and Shias—both of which have contributed to the rise of ISIS."" This is what Obama has been trying to do. (Trump has indicated that he's willing to give Russia free rein to launch airstrikes in Syria, even though Russia's military operations there have caused civilian casualties and exacerbated the ongoing humanitarian disaster.) Clinton also calls for working with ""our allies to dismantle the global terror network that supplies radical jihadists with money, weapons, and fighters."" How? By working with European intelligence services, by slamming ISIS affiliates throughout the region, and by ""working with tech companies to fight jihadist propaganda online, intercept ISIS communications, and track and analyze social media posts to stop attacks.""

The bottom line is that there's not much disagreement about the basics of a counter-ISIS strategy. Trump harshly criticizes Obama and Clinton—absurdly claiming they were the ""founders"" of ISIS—but offers nothing new in terms of policy. Defeating ISIS is a complex challenge with no easy answers or quick fixes. What probably matters most is not which candidate has the best three-point plan, but which potential commander in chief is the most competent, the most knowledgeable, and the best able to understand and deal with the nuances and complications of this damn difficult task."
100365,1005,Here's a Preview of How Donald Trump Could Use Hurricane Matthew to Attack Hillary Clinton,http://www.motherjones.com/politics/2016/10/donald-trump-hurricane-matthew,14,"Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump have announced they are pausing their campaign events while they wait to see if Hurricane Matthew, the Category 4 storm now barreling through the Caribbean, makes landfall in the United States Thursday evening. That doesn't mean either presidential candidate is expected to remain idle as the storm continues to intensify. In fact, both campaigns are reportedly trying to figure out how to effectively demonstrate strength, without appearing to exploit a potential catastrophe for political points.

Clinton is already taking some heat, after it was revealed her campaign purchased television spots on the Weather Channel ahead of the storm. Trump has so far restricted himself to sending best wishes to residents, urging them to remain safe. But a glimpse of his past remarks during times of disaster offer a preview of how he could respond should Matthew hit land. In the past, he has used hurricanes and other natural disasters as opportunities to attack President Barack Obama and re-up his favorite conspiracy theories: While it remains to be seen if Trump will stick to his current restraint, if this year has taught us anything, it's that Trump's inflammatory statements and his self-congratulations are his most predictable trait.  And then, of course, there's his generosity."
100366,1005,Trump Says He Mocked Women's Looks to Be Entertaining,http://www.motherjones.com/politics/2016/10/trump-says-he-mocked-womens-looks-because-its-funny,14,"Donald Trump defended his habit of publicly ridiculing women's looks, arguing that it has entertainment value. Trump, who made the comment during an interview with an NBC affiliate in Las Vegas before giving a speech there Wednesday evening, seemed to claim that as long as mocking women is funny, it's a fine way to grab headlines and ramp up ratings.

""You have two beautiful daughters past their teenage years,"" the reporter said. ""Can you understand the concern from parents of younger girls that some of your comments could be hurtful to girls struggling with body image and the pressure to be model-perfect?"" Trump responded, ""A lot of that was done for the purpose of entertainment. There's nobody that has more respect for women than I do.""

Much of Trump's public persona over the years has been shaped by his comments about women. He wanted to fire women from one of his golf courses because they weren't hot enough. He made degrading comments about women in regular appearances on the shock jock Howard Stern's show in the 1990s and 2000s and in public speeches where he boasted about hiring women for their looks. In last week's presidential debate, his fat-shaming of Miss Universe Alicia Machado became a campaign issue.

But Trump's claim that his comments about women over the years were just for entertainment is undermined by the fact that they weren't limited to his public appearances. He didn't just shame Machado in front of the cameras; he also allegedly called her ""Miss Piggy"" in private. He commented when female executives in the Trump organization gained weight. On the set of The Apprentice, he talked about the women contestants' appearances when the cameras weren't rolling. He once reportedly asked a Miss Universe whether she thought his then-16-year-old daughter, Ivanka, was hot. He passed the 1993 White House Correspondents Dinner talking to a model seated next to him about ""the 'tits' and legs of the other female guests and asking how they measured up to those of other women, including his wife.""

Perhaps when Trump says ""a lot of that was for entertainment,"" he just means he personally found it entertaining."
100367,1006,Report: Private polls by both parties show “precipitous drop” by Trump among key groups,http://hotair.com/archives/2016/10/06/report-private-polls-parties-show-precipitous-drop-trump-among-key-groups/,14,"Assuming this is true, it makes Paul Ryan’s decision to campaign with Trump this weekend in Wisconsin even stranger. This is the “run away!” stage for downballot Republicans, not the photo-op stage. Maybe Ryan’s simply resolved to be a good soldier for the nominee in the home stretch no matter what risks that might entail for his caucus. Think that’ll buy him any extra goodwill from Trump-loving, establishment-hating populists in the future?

Actually, maybe Ryan thinks we’re perilously close to the “Trump starts blaming Republicans for his looming defeat” stage and wants to show some team spirit in hopes of not being one of his targets. Either way, the most important presidential debate in modern American history is just three short days away.

Should Mr. Trump falter badly in his second debate with Hillary Clinton on Sunday in St. Louis, Republican congressional candidates may take it as a cue to flee openly from their nominee, said two senior Republicans involved at high levels of the campaign who spoke on the condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to discuss private party strategy.

Mr. Trump has already slipped perceptibly in public polls, trailing widely this week in Pennsylvania and by smaller margins in Florida and North Carolina — three states he cannot afford to lose. But private polling by both parties shows an even more precipitous drop, especially among independent voters, moderate Republicans and women, according to a dozen strategists from both parties who spoke on the condition of anonymity because the data was confidential.

Liesl Hickey, a Republican strategist involved in several House races in swing states, said she was dismayed by a sudden exodus of independent voters in more diverse parts of the country.

“They are really starting to pull away from Trump,” said Ms. Hickey, describing his soaring unpopularity with independents as entering “uncharted territory.”
It’s odd to me that private polling would be conspicuously more dour for Trump than public polls are, and in a nonpartisan way too. I can’t think of an obvious reason for that (here’s one theory) unless both parties are expecting a more Democratic-heavy electorate this fall than public pollsters are. Maybe they’re detecting a GOTV advantage for Clinton that’s larger than pollsters realize? This quote from Clinton campaign chief Robby Mook should be taken with a grain of salt, but it’s worth noting.

Incidentally, we may have already reached the “anti-Trump Republicans with nothing to lose start showing their cards” stage: Speaking of the debate, Trump told the New York Post yesterday that he’s not planning to bring up Bill Clinton’s sexual misdeeds at Sunday’s debate despite sending some strong signals about that last week. (“I want to win this election on my policies for the future, not on Bill Clinton’s past.”) Presumably Kellyanne Conway and her polling team looked closely at that and concluded that it would backfire. It’s a hard argument to make, as noted before, because it would force Trump to focus on Hillary as an accomplice to Bill’s scandals when the average low-information voter probably views her as a prime victim of them. And if Trump got too mean with his attacks, it might convince even more undecided voters that he doesn’t have a “presidential temperament.” The best thing he can do to help himself on Sunday is stay calm, not let Clinton provoke him, frame her as the personification of a failed status quo, and sound like he knows what he’s talking about. But then, that was the game plan for debate one also and it didn’t work out.

Here’s Kelly Ayotte executing the “run away!” strategy in New Hampshire, notably after agreeing that Trump is a role model during the Senate debate there a few days ago. A new poll of NH out today has Trump down just two points, one of his best showings in the state ever; the same poll has Ayotte up more than six points over Maggie Hassan. "
100368,1006,Justice Department drops charges in case that could have exposed Hillary’s Benghazi/gun running connections,http://hotair.com/archives/2016/10/06/justice-department-drops-charges-case-exposed-hillarys-benghazigun-running-connections/,14,"The Department of Justice has dropped charges against an American man they said illegally supplied arms to Libyan rebels during the actions that led to the ouster and death of Muammar Qaddafi while Hillary CLinton was Secretary of State.

The DOJ says they dropped the charges after “discovery rulings” from U.S. District Court Judge David Campbell had been made. The man facing the charges, Marc Turi, says the reason the charges were dropped stem from the Obama Administration’s fear that documents would reveal that the gun running activity was approved and coordinated by the Clinton State Department.

“They don’t want this stuff to come out because it will look really bad for Obama and Clinton just before the election,” an associate of Turi told Politico, claiming that information sought by Turi’s team would show Clinton’s own role in arming Libyan rebels fighting former strongman Col. Muammar Qaddafi while she was secretary of state.
It has long been believed that part of the curious behavior of the Obama Administration following the September 11, 2012 terrorist attack in Benghazi was motivated by efforts to hide illegal gun running operations.

Last year, Clare Lopez, former CIA officer and co-author of the Citizen’s Commission on Benghazi (CCB) told Breitbart that she had uncovered evidence through her investigation that showed just that:

“The Obama administration effectively switched sides in what used to be called the Global War on Terror [GWOT] when it decided to overthrow the sovereign government of our Libyan ally, Muammar Qaddafi, who’d been helping in the fight against al-Qaeda, by actually teaming up with and facilitating gun-running to Libyan al-Qaeda and Muslim Brotherhood [MB] elements there in 2011,” explained Lopez. “This U.S. gun-running policy in 2011 during the Libyan revolution was directed by [then] Secretary of State Hillary Clinton and [the late Libya Ambassador] Christopher Stevens, who was her official envoy to the Libyan AQ rebels.”
Fox News’ Catherine Herridge revealed documents last year showing the Obama Administration not only knew the Benghazi terror attacks had een planned at least 10 days in advance and that weapons had been shipped from the Benghazi port to arm reels/terrorists in Syria: Weapons from the former Libya military stockpiles were shipped from the port of Benghazi, Libya to the Port of Banias and the Port of Borj Islam, Syria. The weapons shipped during late-August 2012 were Sniper rifles, RPG’s, and 125 mm and 155mm howitzers missiles.

During the immediate aftermath of, and following the uncertainty caused by, the downfall of the ((Qaddafi)) regime in October 2011 and up until early September of 2012, weapons from the former Libya military stockpiles located in Benghazi, Libya were shipped from the port of Benghazi, Libya to the ports of Banias and the Port of Borj Islam, Syria. The Syrian ports were chosen due to the small amount of cargo traffic transiting these two ports. The ships used to transport the weapons were medium-sized and able to hold 10 or less shipping containers of cargo.
Former US Attorney Andrew McCarthy wrote about the obvious gun-running connections at National Review in August:

Remember the state of play in mid 2012. Obama was locked in a tight reelection race. He was falsely claiming that he had “decimated” al-Qaeda (which was actually thriving); that he was ending American wars (which were actually intensifying as he drew troops down despite ground conditions); and that his pro-Islamist policies were helping forge democracy in places like Egypt (then under Muslim Brotherhood rule) and Libya (which had disintegrated into a failed state under domination by Islamist militias). Prior to the November election, if Obama had openly announced that his administration was arming Syrian Islamists, it would have been highly controversial. It would have spotlighted how that same policy had failed in Libya, a fact to which neither the media nor Republicans had called public attention. This, no doubt, is why reports that Obama was “launching a covert operation to send weapons to Syrian rebels for the first time” (as the Times of London’s Christina Lamb put it) did not appear until immediately after Obama had won a second term.
 

The discovery process for Mr. Turi’s criminal trial would have answered some important questions.

Did Hillary Clinton secretly (and perhaps illegally) arm Libyan rebels to help facilitate her misguided Libya policy? And did that operation transform into a plan to arm Syrian rebels in the days preceding the terror attacks in Benghazi?

Thanks to the Obama Justice Department, we won’t soon find out. Unless, of course, we have a new Attorney General next year appointed by someone other than Mrs. Clinton."
100369,1006,"It’s on: Megyn Kelly, Hannity exchange shots over Trump",http://hotair.com/archives/2016/10/06/megyn-kelly-hannity-exchange-shots-trump/,14,"Here’s a feud to make everyone happy. If you’re on Team Hannity, i.e. Team Trump, good news: This sort of thing makes it more likely that Kelly will leave Fox when her contract is up. If you’re on Team Kelly, good news: This sort of thing makes it more likely that Kelly will leave Fox when her contract is up.

First, watch the clip.Megyn started it, right? Well, wait. Back in April, shortly after Trump and Kelly had their reconciliation interview, Hannity hosted a town hall with Trump on his show and brought up Kelly. The pro-Trump crowd booed her heartily as Trump smiled. Hannity said nothing to defend his colleague. Then, after last week’s debate, Kelly introduced Hannity’s interview with Trump this way: ”We’ve got Trump speaking to our own Sean Hannity. We’ll see whether he speaks to the journalists in this room after that interview.” That was perceived as a shot at the fluffiness of Hannity’s treatment of Trump. Really, they’re natural antagonists. If you’re all-in on Trump, as Hannity emphatically is, then Kelly is a saboteur who showed her cards at the first Fox News primary debate last year. If you’re all-in on basic journalistic standards, as Kelly is, then Hannity’s unpaid volunteerism for Trump at 10 p.m. is an embarrassment to the network.

Did Kelly say anything that’s incorrect, though, either in the clip above or after the debate last week? Hannity proclaims loudly and regularly that he’s not a journalist. That’s his get-out-of-jail-free card for cutting ads for his favorite candidate and pushing garbage online polls that his network’s own polling bureau denounces. It’s also true, as Kelly says, that Trump’s endless national media tour has gotten more, shall we say, selective lately. Brian Stelter noted on September 19th that Trump, despite being omnipresent across American news networks all last year and for much of this year, has increasingly retreated to Fox News. His willingness to field questions at press conferences, a welcome contrast to Clinton ducking the media this spring and summer, has also dried up. All of that is good strategy by a campaign that’s trying to minimize the risks of him saying anything self-destructive in the home stretch, especially when they’re trying to present him as a more disciplined candidate to swing voters, but the fact remains that Kelly is right that Hannity’s show is a safe space for Trump. And in saying that, she doesn’t spare Clinton criticism: Most of what she says in the clip above, in fact, is a criticism of Hillary for ducking tough interviews (most notably with Kelly herself). That’s the irony of Hannity’s tweet — he, of all people, is accusing Kelly of being in the tank for a candidate when she just got finished scrutinizing Clinton more harshly in 30 seconds than Hannity has scrutinized Trump all year.

As I write this, Fox still hasn’t commented on the exchange between its two employees even though Hannity, in questioning the impartiality of someone on the “news side” of the network, is essentially attacking Fox’s core claim of being “fair and balanced.” Stay tuned. In lieu of an exit question, I’ll leave you with these quotes from his radio show yesterday via Business Insider’s Oliver Darcy: Why turn the other cheek if you can kick your opponent in the face? The pro-Trump, post-Christian GOP is going to be amazing. Enter the dragon."
100370,1007,WikiLeaks Reveals That Goldman Sachs Held Out On Leasing Office Space For Clinton Foundation,http://www.youngcons.com/wikileaks-reveals-that-goldman-sachs-held-out-on-leasing-office-space-for-clinton-foundation/,14,"The Clinton campaign is firmly planted in the pockets of Wall Street.

There is no getting away from that.

She accepted millions of dollars to speak to them behind closed doors and we recently learned that she was assuring them that she had their back.

That should concern you. Check out this latest revelation from WikiLeaks that shows just how cozy Clinton is with Goldman Sachs.

From The Daily Caller: Goldman Sachs held out leasing an office space to an interested party in order to give the Clinton Foundation priority, according to an email released through WikiLeaks.

Laura Graham, chief operating officer and chief of staff to former President Bill Clinton, wrote to Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton’s chief aide Huma Abedin to “touch base” regarding a potential new “office space” for the Clinton Foundation. “I had a meeting and walk through for the additional space available at 77 Water Street,” Graham told Clinton’s chief aide.

Graham explained that Goldman had “an interested party,” and that if they want the space they will need to “move quickly.”


Awesome!

That’s what Democrats are excited about huh?

Good luck with that…"
100371,1007,ABC Says Trump Bringing Up Bill Clinton’s Shady Past In Debate Would Be “Terrible Decision”,http://www.youngcons.com/abc-says-trump-bringing-up-bill-clintons-shady-past-in-debate-would-be-terrible-decision/,14,"The left constantly tells the media not to bring up Bill Clinton’s long list of sexual indiscretions.

The guy has been accused of rape, and yet the media insists no one talk about it because “he’s not running for president”.

Never mind the fact that Hillary has said many times that he will be a big part of her administration.

You think they would give a Republican that kind of cover? I don’t think so.

Check out this embarrassing display from ABC… From Newsbusters:

Good Morning America’s Jon Karl on Thursday warned Donald Trump against mentioning Bill Clinton’s numerous affairs at Sunday’s town hall debate, lecturing that it would be a “terrible decision.” Talking to ex-Clinton operative George Stephanopoulos, Karl opined, “All this talk about him going after Bill Clinton’s infidelities, I think that’s very hard to do in an intimate setting where the town hall attendees are right there.” Karl added, “I think that would be a terrible decision for him to do.” On the subject of Clinton’s affairs, Stephanopoulos underlined that “it will be quite different for him from the last debate.” He also reiterated Karl’s point that it “will be better for [Trump] not to do it.” Luckily, I don’t think Trump is going to take his cues from ABC.


It’s easy to read between the lines here and see that ABC doesn’t care about Trump being hurt politically, they don’t want him to bring it up because they don’t want millions of people to hear about it during the debate and have it hurt Hillary.

They pretend that they are looking out for Trump’s best interest but of course they aren’t.

Bill Clinton’s past is fair game.

Period."
100372,1007,BREAKING: Hillary’s Missing Email “Boxes” Revealed by FBI…,http://www.youngcons.com/breaking-hillarys-missing-email-boxes-revealed-by-fbi/,14,"Another day, another problem for Hillary with her emails.

Not a week goes by without new evidence or questions coming out about what she was hiding by keeping her emails out of the hands of the government.

Maybe we will never know.

But it’s nice to see that people are still looking.


Check out this latest development.

From Fox News: Buried in the 189 pages of heavily redacted FBI witness interviews from the Hillary Clinton email investigation are details of yet another mystery — about two missing “bankers boxes” filled with the former secretary of state’s emails.

The interviews released earlier this month, known as 302s, also reveal the serious allegation that senior State Department official Patrick Kennedy applied pressure to subordinates to change the classified email codes so they would be shielded from Congress and the public. The details about the boxes are contained in five pages of the FBI file – with a staggering 111 redactions – that summarize the statements of a State Department witness who worked in the “Office of Information Programs and Services (IPS).” The employee told the FBI that, “Initially, IPS officials were told there were 14 bankers boxes of former Secretary of State Hillary CLINTON’s emails at CLINTON’s Friendship Heights office.” Friendship Heights is a neighborhood that straddles the Northwest neighborhood of the District of Columbia and Maryland.

Fox News first reported on the intelligence community’s deep concerns that the process was tampered with, as lawyers with Clinton ties were alleged to be involved at the State Department. Fox News was told in August 2015 that Kennedy was running interference on Capitol Hill. Two sources confirmed that Kennedy went to Capitol Hill and argued one of the emails that kick-started the probe did not contain classified material, citing a 2011 Irish Times newspaper report to claim the information was already public.

Well there you go.

Two missing boxes filled with her emails.

It’s pretty unbelievable that so many voters don’t care about this blatant disregard for the taxpayers who put their trust in her."
100373,1008,What Is Hillary’s ‘Pep Pill’?,http://www.americanthinker.com/articles/2016/10/what_is_hillarys_pep_pill_.html,14,"Hillary Clinton looked and (if you ignored the content) sounded great in the first debate.  She was relaxed, alert, confident, and was still perky at the end.  She seemed like the smiling, waving woman who strode out of her daughter’s apartment 90 minutes after her collapse on September 11.

You don’t recover from pneumonia in 90 minutes, but that’s more than enough time for most medications to take effect.  Was Hillary given some drug or drugs after her collapse, and did she take the same medications before the debate?

Thanks to Wikileaks, we know that in August 2011, an aide sent Cheryl Mills an article on “decision fatigue.”  “Wow, this is spooky [sic] descriptive,” Hillary wrote back.

Two months later, Clinton asked foreign policy advisor Jake Sullivan to look into the stimulant Provigil (modafinil).  She was told it was used to treat excessive sleepiness caused by narcolepsy, work-shift sleep disorder, Parkinson’s, Alzheimer’s, and MS, enjoyed a following among students and truckers, and was being tested by the military of several countries.  Sullivan mentioned that it was preferable to broad stimulants like amphetamines and caffeine, which affect the entire central nervous system.  Your heart doesn’t race, there are no tremors, you don’t feel or look high.  Though a schedule IV controlled substance, modafilin also appears to be non-addictive.*

[*Sullivan was not correct in describing how the drug works.  It does not slow the release of GABA, but interferes with the protein that removes another neurotransmitter, dopamine, from synapses.  Thus, like caffeine and amphetamines, it increases dopamine levels, but through a different mechanism. ]

Not surprisingly, Dr. Lisa Bardack doesn’t mention prescribing Provigil or any other dopamine reuptake inhibitor in her “Healthcare Statement” of July 2015.  Hillary’s medications “include Armour Thyroid, antihistamines, Vitamin B12, and Coumadin,” Bardack writes, and she takes no other medications “on a regular basis.”

Coumadin (warfarin) poses serious bleeding risks, and though it remains the most widely prescribed anticoagulant and is indicated for venous thrombosis, not many physicians would claim that a patient requiring lifelong warfarin, and with Clinton’s history of clotting, was “in excellent health,” as Bardack’s 2015 letter concludes.  (This is downgraded to “healthy” in the 2016 letter, though most physicians would be reluctant to conclude even this of a patient who has had a chronic cough for nine months, has a history of falls and needs assistance with stairs, and has had recent episodes of dyskinesia [her spasmodic head movements].)



The problem of maintaining the appropriate dosage of warfarin is compounded by the fact that hypothyroidism decreases sensitivity to oral anticoagulants.  It would be interesting to know how often Clinton undergoes INR monitoring (the test for blood clotting).  Some research indicates tests should be performed weekly.

The use of Armour Thyroid has also raised questions.

The most frequently prescribed medication for hypothyroidism is Synthroid, levothyroxine, the synthetic equivalent of the hormone thyroxine (T4).  Armour Thyroid, an extract of desiccated porcine thyroid, contains both T4 and a second hormone synthesized from iodine, triiodothyronine (T3), in a ratio of about 4:1, the same ratio as they are produced in humans.  T3, however, is about four times as potent as T4, has a faster onset, and shorter half-life (1 day vs. 5-7 days).  It provides some patients with a little buzz.

This could explain the results of a 2013 study which revealed that whereas there was no difference in the control of the symptoms, 49% of patients preferred desiccated thyroid extract, 19% levothyroxine, and 23% had no preference.

Some endocrinologists and other physicians worry about the over-prescription of natural thyroid.

A physician who wishes to remain anonymous has written to me:

Armour thyroid has gained additional following in recent years, particularly among “alternative” medicine practitioners.  Not all practitioners of alternative medicine follow accepted guidelines for diagnosis of hypothyroidism.  Some may regard low-normal (but still normal) free T4 or free T3 levels to be indicative of hypothyroidism if symptoms of fatigue are present, even with normal TSH.  Others will diagnose hypothyroidism clinically, as for example using morning body temperature as a surrogate for thyroid hormone homeostasis (e.g. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wilson%27s_temperature_syndrome#Patient_death_and_medical_license_suspension).  There are a great many ways for an alternative medicine physician to inappropriately diagnose hypothyroidism. Different examples (e.g. Wilson’s Temperature Syndrome) can be individually criticized.

The danger of inappropriately prescribed thyroid extract is that it can induce hyperthyroidism and suppress the production of TSH, thyroid stimulating hormone, secreted by the pituitary.

What disturbs the anonymous physician, and others, like Dr. Ted Noel, is a statement from Dr. Bardack’s September 2016 letter, in which she declares that Clinton “has remained stable for many years on Armour thyroid to treat her hypothyroidism (a low T3 level).”

According to the American Thyroid Association and the American Association of Clinical Endocrinologists, a low T3 level is not recommended as a test for diagnosing hypothyroidism:

""RECOMMENDATION 10: Serum total T3 or assessment of serum free T3 should not be done to diagnose hypothyroidism. Grade A, BEL 2… Recommendation 10 was upgraded to A because of many independent lines of evidence and expert opinion.“ (p. 25/1012)  (https://www.aace.com/files/final-file-hypo-guidelines.pdf#page=25).

""Serum T3 measurement, whether total or free, has limited utility in hypothyroidism because levels are often normal due to hyperstimulation of the remaining functioning thyroid tissue by elevated TSH and to up-regulation of type 2 iodothyronine deiodinase  (https://www.aace.com/files/final-file-hypo-guidelines.pdf#page=12).

The manufacturer of Armour Thyroid recommends testing T4 serum levels as well as the TSH suppression test, and warns about interactions with oral anticoagulants.

Hyperthyroidism is associated with a prothrombotic state.  The patient is more likely to develop blood clots.

There’s been speculation that the deep vein thromboses Clinton suffered in 1998 and 2009 may have been induced by frequent air travel, even though neither as First Lady nor as Secretary of State would Hillary have been confined to a cramped coach seat.  On the other hand, it’s very unlikely her cerebral venous sinus thrombosis (CVST) of 2012, though it was discovered shortly after Hillary’s concussion, could have been caused by the fall.  She would have to have sustained a skull fracture.  But could the CVST be associated with a hypercoagulable condition resulting from the thyroid extract?

The physician asks, “Is Secretary Clinton medicating, with thyroid hormone or other medications, to overcome fatigue or in an attempt to increase mental performance?”

He or she then asks the following questions:

What were Secretary Clinton’s TSH, free T4 levels, free T3 levels, and symptoms at the time or her first (original) diagnosis of hypothyroidism?
Who made Secretary Clinton’s first (original) diagnosis of hypothyroidism?
When was Secretary Clinton’s first (original) diagnosis of hypothyroidism made?
What were Secretary Clinton’s TSH, free T4 levels, free T3 levels, and symptoms at any time since diagnosis when she was not taking thyroid medication?
What are Secretary Clinton’s TSH, free T4 and free T3 levels now and at all times while she was taking thyroid medication?
Was Clinton taking thyroid medications near the time of her cerebral venous thrombosis?
What were Secretary Clinton’s TSH, free T4 and free T3 levels at the time of her diagnosis of transverse sinus thrombosis, and in the weeks thereafter? What did her coagulation studies and coagulation factor studies show at that time?
What were Secretary Clinton’s TSH, free T4 and free T3 levels at the time of her diagnosis of any other venous thrombosis, and in the weeks thereafter?
The physician believes that “over-prescription of thyroid medications by practitioners of ‘alternative’ medicine is fairly common these days.”  It has even been prescribed off-label for weight loss.  Dr. Bardack is not a practitioner of “alternative medicine,” but was Clinton nonetheless “abusing” thyroid medications?  And did iatrogenic hyperthyroidism (caused by the thyroid tablets) contribute to the cerebral venous sinus thrombosis?  Information about Hillary’s TSH, T4, and T3 levels at various times would help answer this question.

There remains controversy over the effectiveness of the standard criteria for diagnosing hypothyroidism, and a patient with a low-normal T4 result may benefit from a thyroid supplement.   There has also been a long and sometimes impassioned debate about the merits of natural vs. synthetic thyroid hormones in the treatment of hypothyroidism.

Interestingly, for her other patients Dr. Bardack does not hesitate to prescribe the synthetic hormone.  In fact, the number one drug prescribed by her is levothyroxine sodium (generic Synthroid) and number eight is Synthroid.  For her specialty in NY, the first ranks number four with other physicians, the second, number thirty.  (It’s possible Armour Thyroid was originally prescribed by someone else, and Dr. Bardack agreed to continue the medication.)

At least we cannot exclude the possibility that, whether or not it played a role in the December 2012 CVST, Clinton preferred Armour Thyroid to Synthroid because of its effects as a stimulant, and that both in her daughter’s apartment on September 11th and before the September 26th debate, she was given the drug and/or modafilin.

Any endocrinologists or other physicians, or patients with hypothyroidism, who have opinions on this question are invited to contact the editor.

100374,1008,Woe unto Christian NeverTrumps,http://www.americanthinker.com/articles/2016/10/woe_unto_christian_nevertrumpers.html,14,"For the life of me, I do not understand Christians who say they cannot vote for Trump. Under Obama, leftists/progressives have made huge gains in their efforts to make Christianity illegal in America. 

Remember the old hymn, “I Have Decided to Follow Jesus”? Who could imagine a day would come in America when following Jesus would land you in jail? Criminalizing Christianity is happening and gaining momentum. 

Powerful Leftists have decreed that following Jesus in America today to be hate speech, resulting in Christians being punished, stereotyped, marginalized, intimidated, fired, and even jailed.

A black Christian, Kelvin Cochran, was appointed by Obama to head the National Fire Administration. Atlanta's mayor asked Cochran to return to his hometown to rebuild their fire department. Cochran accepted the job. When a city council member read Cochran's biblical view of marriage in his book, Cochran was fired without due process.

I chuckle, thinking of a phrase used by my late mom who was raised in the rough streets of Baltimore. If you made Mom angry, she would say, “You have torn your drawers with me.” Cochran was the Democrats' golden boy. But when Cochran stood up for Christ which undermined the Democrats' loyalty to the progressive agenda, Cochran tore his drawers with them.

An intern at Cal State was terminated and threatened with being expelled from the graduate program for discussing her faith privately in her off hours. Five Houston pastors caught opposing men using women's restrooms were ordered by the Houston City government to turn over all sermons, text messages and emails regarding gender issues. 

The city of Houston has issued subpoenas demanding a group of pastors turn over any sermons dealing with homosexuality, gender identity, or Annise Parker, the city’s first openly lesbian mayor. And those ministers who fail to comply could be held in contempt of court.

Hillary in our country's driver's seat will unquestionably enthusiastically press the anti-Christian gas-peddle down to the floor, splattering and making roadkill of our Constitutional promise of religious freedom. The anti-Christian American Left and Hillary are one and the same.

Republicans allowed Obama to be the most lawless president in U.S. History due to his race. 

Republicans will repeat their cowardly behavior with Hillary; fearful of media criticism for opposing the first woman president on any issue.

Another thing that has me scratching my head is Hillary and the Democrats' respect and sympathetic support of Muslims with their Sharia Law while openly showing disdain for Christians. Under Sharia Law, husbands are allowed to beat disobedient wives, kill adulterous wives and kill homosexuals. So why does Hillary, who claims to be an advocate for women and homosexuals, protect Islam while using the iron-fist of government to criminalize Christianity? Democrat Loretta Lynch of the DOJ said she will prosecute anyone speaking badly of Islam. 

In effect, Lynch is saying she would use prosecution as a weapon to protect Muslims from others employing their First Amendment rights.

Meanwhile, Democrat-controlled state and federal governments have declared war on Christianity. Sharia Law is creeping into prominence in America due to surging Muslim migration. This time around, Alabama voters defeated Muslims' push to implement Sharia law. After four or eight years of Hillary in the Oval Office, Sharia could be the law of the land. Don't laugh. Who could imagine daring to state the thousands of years honored belief that marriage is between one man and one woman would cost an American everything; close down their church and their business?

In defense of refusing to vote for Trump, I have heard Christians say, “Voting for the lesser evil is still evil.” While that sounds pious and profound, it is simply not true. As Christians, we know we live in a fallen sinful world. Therefore, nothing and no one is perfect. Sometimes voting for the lesser evil is the moral and upright thing to do. Not voting for Trump is a vote for Hillary; a vote for religious persecution.

The Bible says “All have sinned and come short of the glory of God” (Romans 3:23). Therefore, one could argue that every vote you have ever made is in reality you choosing the lesser of two evils.

For the record, I do not understand how anyone can put Trump's shortcomings in the same league as Hillary's decades of documented evil corruption; lives lost, and calculated destruction of peoples' lives, especially women, for personal political gain. 

Christians are being ordered to surrender their children for anti-Christian indoctrination. I am talkin' government confiscating your children for the sole purpose of teaching them to embrace and celebrate what God calls sin. This Orwellian anti-Christ persecution will surely double down, probably triple down, under Hillary. Who will stop her? No one. This is why a long list of prominent Christian leaders are begging Christians to vote in this fast approaching presidential election.

For the spiritual defense of our kids alone, how can a Christian justify sitting out the election, writing in their favorite candidate or writing in Daffy Duck? How can a Christian allow the furtherance of our government mandating a turning away from God?

Brother and sister Christians, God calls us to be salt. Salt makes a difference. Be salt. Jump aboard the Trump Train.

100375,1008,"What Kind of Genius Loses $6 Billion, Hillary?",http://www.americanthinker.com/articles/2016/10/what_kind_of_genius_loses_6_billion_hillary.html,14,"Behold Hillary Clinton’s hypocritical harrumph at the revelation from leaked private and personal tax records being published in the New York Times. Her umbrage at Trump reporting a carried-over nearly $1 billion loss on his 2015 tax return is phony and ignores that this is a common practice legally taken advantage of by many, including herself. Looking on page 17 of her 2015 tax returns, we find the righteously indignant Mrs. Clinton claiming a nearly $700,000 capital gains loss on assets held for more than one year.

The New York Times, as it turns out, also used the net loss provision of the tax code, and why not? The purpose of the provision is to let businesses survive in rough times and to keep their employees employed. Without it small businesses would die in infancy and larger businesses would teeter in tough times. This provision was put into the tax code to stimulate investment and encourage the risk-takers who create jobs. Trump was right when he said he had a fiduciary responsibility to investors and employees to pay as little tax as legally possible. The first objective of business is to stay in business, something which someone who never created a job or met a payroll might not grasp.

What kind of genius loses nearly a billion dollars? A genius like Obama buddy Warren Buffett reported a pre-tax loss of $873 million for tax year 2013. And, as the blog Flopping Aces reports, the New York Times also has used the ability to offset taxes with losses:

…as we noted previously, the NYT itself is also perfectly happy to take advantage of the US tax to minimize the amount of money it pays to the government: in 2014 the company got a tax refund of $3.6 million despite having a $29.9 million pretax profit, an effective negative tax rate for 2014, which it explained was favorably affected by approximately $21.1 million for the reversal of reserves for uncertain tax positions due to the lapse of applicable statutes of limitations.

Still, Hillary was in high dudgeon over someone who actually creates jobs instead of living off the taxpayer, as she has for around three decades, Trump merely taking advantage of this provision in the way lawmakers intended when they put it in the tax code:

""What kind of genius loses a billion dollars in a single year?"" Clinton asked a crowd in downtown Toledo, with a hint of amusement in her voice….

""After he made all those bad bets and lost all that money, he didn't lift a finger to protect his employees, or the small businesses and contractors he'd hired, or the people of Atlantic City,"" Clinton said. ""They all got hammered, while he was busy with his accountants figuring out how he could keep living like a billionaire.""

This comes from a woman who claimed she and her husband were “dead broke” when they left the White House in 2001 yet somehow amassed a fortune estimated at $200 million without holding a real job or starting a real business. Hillary Clinton has not taken a vow of poverty, using her position as Secretary of State to sell access and influence to donors to the Clinton Foundation.

Trump has “stiffed” nobody. He has instead kept most of his businesses in business, paying state and local taxes, payroll taxes, property taxes, all while keeping thousands of employees employed, employees who themselves pay taxes.

At least Trump is playing with his own money, not that of the U.S. taxpayer. What kind of genius, Hillary, does it take to double the national debt in eight years, accumulating more debt than all prior presidents? It took someone like Barack Obama, whom you faithfully served, who squandered billions, for example, on failed green energy projects and companies like Solyndra. As for yourself, Hillary, what kind of genius does to take to lose $6 billion of the taxpayers’ money when you ran the State Department?

As the government watchdog group Judicial Watch noted:

In a mind-boggling example of how the government blows -- or perhaps steals -- our tax dollars, billions vanished from the U.S. State Department mostly while Hillary Clinton ran it, according to a new alert issued by the agency’s inspector general.

Could the former Secretary of State be using the cash to fund an upcoming presidential campaign? In all, $6 billion are missing and it’s highly unlikely any of the money will ever be recovered. The cash was supposed to be used to pay contractors but it just disappeared and documents that could help track the dough cannot be located. How convenient! The paper trail, which federal law says must be maintained in the case of government contracts, has been destroyed or was never created to begin with.

How could this possibly happen? Like a lot of government agencies, outside contracts are a free-for-all at the State Department with virtually no oversight. Hundreds of millions of dollars are doled out annually for a variety of services and no one bothers to follow up on the deals. This “exposes the department to significant financial risk,” according to the State Department Inspector General, which issued a special management alert this month outlining the lost $6 billion. The watchdog further writes that “it creates conditions conducive to fraud, as corrupt individuals may attempt to conceal evidence of illicit behavior by omitting key documents from the contract file.”

The taxpayers got stiffed $6 billion by your gross mismanagement of our money. You stiffed the taxpayers for $6 billion, while your husband’s speaking fees doubled, and the Clinton Foundation raked in hundreds of millions from foreign governments and donors seeking to buy access and influence through donations to the Clinton Foundation. We may never find out where this money went, but we can guess it didn’t go to increase security in Benghazi after your State Department turned down requests and ignored warnings if an imminent attack. You stiffed the four Americans who died at Benghazi before you lied to their parents in front of their son’s caskets.

You want to see Trump’s tax returns? Let’s audit the Clinton Foundation and your State Department first. Trump ran his businesses like businesses. You ran the State Department like you run the Clinton Foundation – as personal slush fund and vehicle for your personal political ambitions.

100376,1009,TWO INVESTIGATIONS,http://www.powerlineblog.com/archives/2016/10/two-investigations.php,14,"Noel Francisco and James Burnham practice law at Jones Day in Washington, D.C. They represented former Virginia governor Bob McDonnell against the federal corruption charges brought against him and his wife by the government. The story came to as happy an ending it could have for Governor McDonnell and his wife when the Supreme Court unanimously set aside their convictions this past June and the government subsequently chose to abandon the charges. The Supreme Court opinion in the case (by Chief Justice Roberts) is here>.

In the Wall Street Journal column “The FBI treated Hillary Clinton with kid gloves” (accessible via Google here, the headline really doesn’t capture the severity of the column), Francisco and Burnham now look back on the FBI/DOJ investigation of the McDonnells and contrast it with the faux investigation of Hillary Clinton. They contrast the two investigations on the following points:

• Conduct ambush interviews.

• Immunize only witnesses who can help deliver convictions.

• Investigate and charge all potential crimes.

• Construe “corruption” broadly.

• Claim that concealment proves consciousness of guilt.

Francisco and Burnham arrive at this conclusion:

FBI Director James Comey said that in Mrs. Clinton’s case there was no evidence of criminal intent. Yet she set up a private email server in her basement and permanently deleted thousands of the emails it contained. A plausible motive would be shielding her activities from public scrutiny. The Comey standard—that direct evidence of knowing criminality is needed to prosecute—is certainly not the one that his agency and the Justice Department applied to Gov. McDonnell for more than three years.

To be clear, we aren’t endorsing these heavy-handed tactics, many of which are befitting Inspector Javert of “Les Misérables.” But these are the sorts of things investigators do when they are serious about bringing criminal charges. In deciding whether the investigation into Mrs. Clinton was a real one—as opposed to a grand, expensive spectacle of law-enforcement theater—Gov. McDonnell’s treatment is instructive.

“Instructive” doesn’t quite capture it, but understatement has its uses."
100377,1009,HILLARY OBTAINED PENTAGON ACCESS FOR CHELSEA’S FRIEND,http://www.powerlineblog.com/archives/2016/10/hillary-obtained-pentagon-access-for-chelseas-friend.php,14,"During her time as Secretary of State, Hillary Clinton sought to arrange Pentagon and State Department consulting contracts for a close friend of her daughter Chelsea. So reports Bill Gertz of the Washington Free Beacon, based on recently released emails from Clinton’s private server.

The emails show that in 2009, Clinton arranged meetings between Jacqueline Newmyer Deal, whom Chelsea has described as her best friend, and Pentagon officials. Deal was the head of the defense consulting group Long Term Strategy Group.

Emails show that her meetings with Pentagon officials involved discussions about contracting. Emails also suggest that Clinton also tried to help Deal obtain consulting work with the State Department’s director of policy planning.

Clinton’s intervention raises obvious ethical concerns. As Gertz explains:

Government cronyism, or the use of senior positions to help family friends, is not illegal. However, the practice appears to violate federal ethics rules that prohibit partiality, or creating the appearance of conflicts of interest.

Specifically, the Code of Federal Ethics states that government employees “shall act impartially and not give preferential treatment to any private organization or individual.” Pentagon ethics guidelines also call for avoiding actions that would create even the appearance of improper behavior or conflicts of interest. . . .

Both federal government and Pentagon ethics regulations state that “an employee shall not use or permit the use of his government position or title or any authority associated with his public office in a manner that is intended to coerce or induce another person, including a subordinate, to provide any benefit, financial or otherwise, to himself or to friends, relatives, or persons with whom the employee is affiliated in a nongovernmental capacity.”

The facts reported by Gertz suggest that Clinton may well have violated these rules. Initially, Clinton arranged a meeting between Deal and Michele Flournoy, the newly installed undersecretary of defense for policy. The well-regarded Flournoy is now considered the favorite to become Secretary of Defense in a Hillary Clinton administration.

Flournoy reportedly was seeking young women to mentor. One might have thought there were enough young women to mentor without “mentoring” someone looking for defense contracts. In this case, though, the potential defense contractor was referred by the U.S. Secretary of State.

Even so, referring a friend for mentoring would not seem problematic except perhaps on an overly literal view of the ethics regulations. In this case, though, the “mentoring” spilled over into talk with a Flournoy aide about contracting, according to the emails. In thanking Clinton for her assistance, Deal wrote:

I met with Michele’s other deputy yesterday, and we had a productive discussion about Iran and developments in maritime Asia. We also discussed contract vehicles and mapped out what we need to do so that we can go to work! I am very grateful for everything you have done.

A little later, Deal informed Clinton:

Happily, Michele Flournoy’s office is reaching out and has asked me to participate in a wargame next week for the [Quadrennial Defense Review], which I hope will build the foundation for a contract between her office and LTSG. I am extremely grateful to you for helping me find opportunities to serve our government.

Deal’s company went on to obtain a series of Defense Department contracts, according to Gertz.

In my view, Clinton’s intervention on behalf of Deal is arguably a case of “an employee [using her] government position or title. . .in a manner that is intended to. . .induce another person. . .to provide a[] benefit, financial or otherwise, to. . .friends.” Access that leads to the award of contracts where the official who facilitates the access knows the friend is trying to obtain contracts through the access may well fall within this description of prohibited conduct. The emails show that Clinton had this knowledge.

Clinton also tried to help Deal out at the State Department, the emails suggest. The Department’s director of policy planning, Anne-Marie Slaughter, turned down a proposal from Deal for a contract to do work for her office. But if Clinton secured access for Deal to Slaughter knowing that the access would be used to attempt to win contracts, it may not matter that the attempt failed.

Even without State Department contracts, Deal’s company has done quite well with the Obama administration. Gertz estimates the total value of its contracts with the Pentagon to be around $6 million since 2009.

There are famous exceptions, but generally it pays to be a friend of the Clintons."
100378,1009,THE MEGYN KELLY-SEAN HANNITY FEUD DEEPENS,http://www.powerlineblog.com/archives/2016/10/the-megyn-kelly-sean-hannity-feud-deepens.php,14,"The Washington Post reports on the clash between Fox News personalities Megyn Kelly and Sean Hannity — a feud that I suspect delights the Post’s liberal media reporter Paul Farhi.

Yesterday, after criticizing Hillary Clinton for doing lightweight interviews with “Entertainment Tonight” and comedian-talk show host Steve Harvey, Kelly stated on her program:

Donald Trump, with all due respect to my friend at 10 pm, will go on Hannity and pretty much only Hannity and will not venture out to the unsafe spaces these days, which doesn’t exactly expand the tent [of supporters].

Hannity fired back on Twitter: “u should be mad at @hillaryClinton. Clearly you support her. And @realDonaldTrump did talk to u.”

Hannity tweet is nonsense. First, in the segment to which Hannity took exception, Kelly expressed her displeasure with Clinton.

Second, it isn’t clear that Kelly supports Clinton. She has never declared her preference in this election, and her reporting has been highly critical of both major presidential candidates.

Third, it’s true that Trump talked to Kelly. But that was months ago. Recently, Trump (probably wisely) has tended to avoid interviews with journalists who are likely to ask him tough questions. This was Kelly’s point, and she specifically said she’s talking about Trump’s practices “these days.”

Kelly’s corollary was that Hannity doesn’t ask Trump difficult questions. One can debate whether Kelly should have called out her colleague, but it’s indisputable that Hannity provides Trump a “safe space.” His interviews with the tycoon are fawning and, in my view, embarrassing.

One can fault Kelly for letting frustration over not being able to interview either major party presidential nominee spill over into public criticism of a colleague. But one can’t honestly disagree with what she said. Nor was Hannity’s response fact-based.

The big questions, I suppose, are whether Fox News is “big enough” for Kelly and Hannity and, if not, who will be the first to go. I would think that if Trump loses decisively, Hannity might be a casualty.

What use would the network have for a commentator who shilled relentlessly for a defeated and discredited non-conservative candidate and who, undoubtedly, will spend the next few years accusing “the establishment” of “stabbing Trump in the back”?

As between such a commentator and a host with star power whose show tilts conservative but maintains a decent regard for journalistic standards, the choice should be easy."
100379,1010,"Asked to clarify the Muslim ban, Pence puts words in Trump’s mouth",https://thinkprogress.org/pence-not-defending-trump-muslim-ban-76b90defe29c#.ek0hp7pm1,14,"Mike Pence may have won Tuesday night’s vice presidential debate, but he didn’t do a particularly good job defending his running mate’s policy positions. Rather than amplifying Trump’s calls for the proliferation of nuclear weapons or support for privatizing social security, for example, Pence simply pretended Trump never said those things.
Two days later, Pence is still at it. During a Thursday morning appearance on MSNBC’s Morning Joe, Pence put words into Trump’s mouth and said his running mate doesn’t support a blanket ban on Muslim immigration. Trump himself, however, has never said that.
Asked by Joe Scarborough whether Trump’s proposed ban would apply to all Muslims, Pence said, “Of course not.”
“We’re talking about areas of the world, territories and specifically countries, that have been so compromised by terrorism that we can’t know for certain who those people are,” he added. During an appearance on CNN minutes later, Pence was grilled by host Chris Cuomo about how it’s possible for him to defend some of Trump’s most controversial positions when Pence has condemned them in the past and Trump hasn’t really disavowed anything.
“Because it’s not Donald Trump’s position now,” Pence said with a chuckle. But Trump’s support for a complete ban is still plastered all over his website. You can even use the Trump/Pence website to follow how Trump has twisted and turned on the issue throughout 2016. He strongly supported a complete Muslim ban early this year, but then pivoted to saying it was “just a suggestion” when he became the presumptive Republican presidential nominee in the spring. But then, following the June mass shooting at a gay nightclub in Orlando perpetrated by an American-born Muslim, Trump reverted to calling for a complete ban. In July, Trump added a wrinkle, saying he supports stopping immigration “from any nation that has been compromised by terrorism.” But despite his campaign insisting otherwise, Trump himself characterized the tweak as “an expansion,” not a rollback, of his original proposal for a blanket ban. Then, in August, Trump introduced the idea of requiring aspiring immigrants to pass an ideological test before being allowed entry. Requiring tests of that sort, however, isn’t inconsistent with a blanket ban on Muslims. In fact, Trump said questions about religious beliefs would be part of the screening process.
Perhaps Pence’s comments on Morning Joe refer to what Trump said during an MSNBC town hall in March, when he indicated there might be exceptions to the ban_—_namely, his rich Muslim friends.
In any event, the Muslim ban is one issue where Pence hasn’t been in step with Trump from day one. Pence and the rest of the campaign can try and put words in Trump’s mouth, but Trump himself has given no indication he’s moved away from wanting to ban Muslim immigration to the country. It’s yet another example of Pence not defending his running mate."
100380,1010,Paul Ryan plans to use a Trump presidency to ram through his extreme agenda,https://thinkprogress.org/ryan-trump-reconciliation-a403c82f87f8#.jweca75rk,14,"Election Day is still a month away, but House Speaker Paul Ryan (R-WI) has already tipped his hand about how he plans to enact his agenda without interference from Democrats if Donald Trump wins.
At a recent news conference, as reported by Politico, Ryan said that he planned to use the process known as budget reconciliation to implement his policy agenda, which he has dubbed “A Better Way.” That would mean Republicans could pass their priorities without Democratic members of Congress being able to block them.
“This is our plan for 2017,” he said, showing off a copy of the agenda. “Much of this you can do through budget reconciliation… This is our game plan for 2017.”
If the House and Senate passed a budget resolution, they could then start the reconciliation process, which allows the Senate to vote on measures related to fiscal policies without the possibility of them being filibustered and with a limited ability for them to be amended. The bills can address spending_—_including on programs like Medicare, Medicaid, and food stamps —taxes and the debt limit.
Ryan and other Republican lawmakers could use this process to push through their desired changes to the tax code. The tax plan Ryan put forward in June would lower the corporate tax rate, lower rates for the wealthy, and repeal the estate tax. An analysis of the plan found that 99.6 percent of its benefits would go to the richest 1 percent of Americans, leaving just 0.4 percent for everyone else. It would also cost the government $3.1 trillion over a decade.
They could also pass their proposals for Medicare and Medicaid, food stamps, and rental assistance. Ryan recently proposed instituting strict work requirements for food stamps and housing assistance that could mean throwing people off the rolls if they can’t fulfill the new conditions. His recent agenda includes block-granting Medicaid, which would cut the program by billions and leave tens of millions of people uninsured, and replacing the current guarantee of health care coverage under Medicare with a voucher to purchase private health insurance.
Meanwhile, Republicans are likely to gut key parts of the Affordable Care Act this way, as they have already tried to do only to be thwarted by a veto from President Obama.
It seems likely that a President Trump would then sign the measures. One of Trump’s economic advisers, Larry Kudlow, told Politico that passing a tax package through reconciliation would be “not good, fabulous” and “the fastest way in our judgement to get necessary pro-growth tax reform.” He’s been encouraging Trump to use the procedure and he said Trump’s team is considering it.
Reconciliation has been deployed 20 times by both parties, including Republicans pushing through President George W. Bush’s tax cuts in 2001 and 2003 and Democrats pushing through the final version of the Affordable Care Act in 2010. But Republicans expressed widespread outrage about its usage in the latter instance: Ryan himself called it “an extraordinary and unprecedented abuse” and a “convoluted legislative charade” and said, “Never before has the House committee process been so grossly exploited.”"
100381,1010,Trump says he insulted women for ‘entertainment’,https://thinkprogress.org/trump-says-he-insulted-women-for-entertainment-3d7c5973737e#.lu9t2vwch,14,"Donald Trump’s insulting comments about women’s physical appearance have dogged him since the start of his presidential campaign. It famously sparked his feud with Megyn Kelly, who asked him about it at the first Republican presidential debate.
“You’ve called women you don’t like fat pigs, dogs, slobs, and disgusting animals,” Kelly said. “Are you part of the war on women?”
He brushed off the question, saying he didn’t have time to be “politically correct.”
Trump then started to refer to Kelly on Twitter as a “bimbo.”
 In the first presidential debate last week, Hillary Clinton reminded viewers that Donald Trump has referred to women as “pigs,” “slobs,” and “dogs.” Trump defended his comments, particularly as they related to Rosie O’Donnell. “I said very tough things to her and I think everyone would agree that she deserves it and nobody feels sorry for her,” Trump said.
In an appearance on Wednesday night on KSNV, an NBC affiliate in Las Vegas, a reporter asked Trump, who has two daughters, if he understood the impact of his derogatory comments on young girls struggling with their body image.
Trump said he did, adding that he only insulted women for “entertainment.” He is trying to position his sexist remarks as part of his former life as a reality TV star seeking to “entertain” the public.
There are a couple of problems with this explanation.
First, why does Trump find insulting women entertaining? Beyond that, his conduct appeared to extend into his private life. A number of former staff members on The Apprentice recently told the AP that his boorish behavior continued when the cameras were not rolling.
Second, his disparaging remarks about women are not something in the past. Just last week, he repeatedly insulted former Miss Universe Alicia Machado. He told a national TV audience that she “gained a tremendous amount of weight” and called her “disgusting.” There is no sex tape, but this is how Trump lives his life, now and for many years.
As Erin Gloria Ryan wrote in the Daily Beast, “[t]he story of Donald Trump’s misogyny is so old that if it were a person, Donald Trump probably would not date it.”"
100382,1001,"With zero major newspaper endorsements, Donald Trump makes history again",http://www.dailykos.com/stories/2016/10/07/1578927/-With-zero-major-newspaper-endorsements-Donald-Trump-makes-history-again#read-more,15,"As Donald Trump continues to not-prepare for his next debate, his campaign continues to break new ground in sucking.

With just a little over a month until election day, Donald Trump has racked up zero major newspaper endorsements, a first for any major party nominee in American history.
In American history, we repeat. Donald Trump has achieved something never before thought possible among the country's most prominent newspapers: A nationwide consensus that regardless of party affiliation, one of the two candidates is simply unacceptable.

[I]t’s not just the papers but also writers who are taking a stand. Last month, a member of The Wall Street Journal’s traditionally conservative editorial board endorsed Clinton, calling Trump the candidate of “white supremacists and swastika devotees.”
Whether all of this is enough to sway Republican voters to ditch their candidate is one question; a bigger one remains whether the shame of having to vote for Trump will cause voters to just stay home rather than trudging to the ballot box. If that's the case, downballot Republicans would find themselves very bad off indeed.

That still seems an unlikely scenario, however. If the drubbing Trump is getting on the editorial pages transferred to similarly negative coverage on television, where far more people are paying attention, it might, but the news networks continue to pretend Trump is a credible candidate regardless of how much of his erratic behavior or obvious ignorance they have to tiptoe around to do it. The editorial pages may be overwhelmingly of the opinion that the man is unfit for the office, but the ""straight news"" pages still are going out of their way to dodge Trump's manifestly incompetent responses to questions or unshakable obsession with personal vendettas against those who he feels, during any given week, have done him wrong.

Are you a member of MoveOn? No matter where you live, help defeat Donald Trump and take back the Senate by texting MoveOn members in swing states to knock on doors where they live.

News analysts and issue experts have become quite certain that a President Donald Trump would be somewhere between a buffoonish clown and a danger to the republic, but that conclusion is reserved entirely for an op-ed statement tucked into the back of newspapers. Americans are far more likely to flip on, say, CNN, where they will be treated to the spectacle of one lunatic pro-Trump figure after another (ex-campaign head Corey Lewandowski, the profoundly dishonest Katrina Pierson, the execrable forced stupidity of Jeffrey Lord) insisting that Trump's every bleat and warble is genius wrapped in the vernacular of the Common Folk, who do not particularly care if their president knows one damn thing about governing and who deeply appreciate the opportunity to revisit the whole question of whether perhaps the real problem with America is all the Not White Folk.

You know, ""balance."" Perhaps Donald Trump openly lies to crowds, but perhaps the worse crime is pointing it out when he does. Perhaps Donald Trump's responses to policy questions are manifestly incompetent, but perhaps asking policy questions is un-American to begin with. And so forth.

So I remain skeptical that Trump's obvious incompetence and inherent dangerousness will result in the sort of nationwide Republican drubbing that putting up such a buffoonish candidate ought to deserve. Electing Trump would be dangerous to our nation, most longtime political observers seem to agree, but the networks still fret that reporting that honestly themselves could be dangerous to the bottom line. We are at an impasse."
100383,1001,Donald Trump went crying to Congress for a very special tax break,http://www.dailykos.com/stories/2016/10/07/1578865/-Donald-Trump-s-went-crying-to-Congress-for-a-very-special-tax-break#read-more,15,"In 1990, Donald Trump opened the biggest casino in Atlantic City. In 1991, that casino filed for bankruptcy. Lots of the debt Donald Trump had personally guaranteed in his completely unworkable attempt to operate three competing casinos in the same small city, and to finance his casino with high interest junk bonds, fell back on his shoulders. So he did what any big businessman in America would do—he went crying to Congress.

Speaking in a flurry of words, without notes, Donald J. Trump painted the matter in apocalyptic terms. Unless Congress did as he urged, he said, the United States would face catastrophe. “We are not different right now than the Soviet Union,” Mr. Trump said. “They have no incentive, and we have no incentive.”
It took a couple of years, but Trump got exactly what he wanted—a rule change that gave real estate developers unmatched flexibility in writing off losses and tax-free forgiveness of debt.

“The debt forgiveness rule was most important to highly leveraged, big players like Trump,” said Edward D. Kleinbard, a law professor at the University of Southern California. “The 1993 act was designed to loosen the screws on the real estate industry.”
Well, no one would ever say that Donald Trump doesn’t have his screws loosened.

Trump created a public company onto which he could shovel his private debt, but he couldn’t have done it without the rule changes Congress provided.

In many states, any registered voter can request an absentee ballot. Check to see if you can get one and vote early this year.

For almost seven years, real estate developers had to live by … rules. 

Like much of his industry, Mr. Trump was taken somewhat by surprise when Congress moved aggressively in 1986 to crack down on real estate tax shelters. Tax treatment of real estate losses then allowed developers to acquire or build properties purely to generate paper losses for their investors—the proverbial lawyers and dentists—to apply against other earnings. Even ruinous projects like a half-finished, unleased office tower could be converted into a profit-making venture for some investors.
Even under the 1986 rules, real estate developers still had more flexibility in the scope and means of reporting losses than other industries. But it wasn’t enough. Without a better means of getting rid of debt, developers couldn’t enrich themselves off losing investments. 

What did Trump want? One word: loopholes.

“It is a very bad-sounding word, even though it isn’t necessarily a bad thing,” Mr. Trump said.
No. It’s also a bad thing. With it, Trump went on to bankruptcy, after bankruptcy, as well as two decades of going income tax free."
100384,1001,"Donald Trump's bankruptcy was great for him, a disaster for everyone else",http://www.dailykos.com/stories/2016/10/07/1578821/-Donald-Trump-s-bankruptcy-was-great-for-him-a-disaster-for-everyone-else#read-more,15,"Donald Trump didn’t just decide to go into the Atlantic City casino business. He jumped in. Big league. Trump opened two competing casinos in the small, beach-front city and was still determined to have the largest casino in town. To get there, he picked up a third casino in the form of the half-finished Taj Mahal.

… Donald Trump had to convince this commission that he could raise enough money at a low enough interest rate to make this ambitious project feasible.

And what he told the commission in early 1988 was that he wouldn't use a type of loan called a junk bond.
Trump told the commission that banks were lined up to give him money. The thing was, by 1988, the banks had already caught on to Donald Trump. None of them would loan him a dime. So how did Trump finance his deal? With high interest junk bonds.

By the time the casino opened in 1990, with Michael Jackson as a special guest and an overdose of the usual Trump gaudiness, the project was weighed down with debt. Just one year later, it was bankrupt.

While other investors had thought Trump’s buy was a horrible move from the beginning. Trump bragged about his “great deal.” The other investors were right. But then, so was Trump. 

What happened over the course of his decade at the helm of Trump Hotels & Casino Resorts is that he ran the company into the ground, immiserating shareholders, while walking away with enormous bags of cash for himself.
Does Donald Trump scare you so much that you want to vote early? Request an absentee ballot by clicking here.

Trump destroyed the value of Trump Hotels & Casino Resorts—while pocketing $44 million for his personal management of the disaster. But that wasn’t the end of it. Donald Trump doesn’t just treat the Trump Foundation like a personal slush fund, he treats his companies the same way.

… he offloaded personal debts onto the corporate balance sheet and had the public company purchase services ranging from bottled water to plane flights from Trump’s privately held enterprises.

Along the way, he bankrupted the company and all but completely wiped out the value of its stock. 
And when Donald Trump made his comeback, the move was even worse than what he did while he was driving the business into bankruptcy.

To relieve himself of that big debt that shows up on his 1995 tax return, Donald Trump turned to the stock market. In the 1990s, stocks were having a prolonged period of gains, bolstered by companies who were dropping pension plans and instead leaving their employees with 401K plans. To make the 401K plans attractive, companies were pouring PR into the mythology of the market, promising employees returns that would make them millionaires.

There was a hot market; stocks were suddenly a much larger topic around the American dinner table; and the market was seeing an influx of money from new, inexperience investors. For con men, Wall Street was never more attractive.

Trump—flattened under debt from the high-interest financing he had personally guaranteed and saddled with the less-than-worthless remains of Trump Hotels & Casino Resorts, pulled the same Instant Riches switch as many other 90s swindlers: an IPO.

The company’s sole asset at the time was the Trump Plaza Hotel and Casino, and the IPO money was supposed to be reinvested in the company. But Trump Plaza was already indebted, so one of the first moves made with the new equity was to pay down the debts — debts that Trump had personally guaranteed, meaning that company money was used not just to relieve a company debt, but a personal debt owed by Trump himself. ...

The public company bought the Trump Castle casino from Trump, for example, for $490 million, a price that James Sterngold reported at the time “was based on optimistic profit projections and was about $100 million too high.” 
Oh, and of course …

Trump also paid himself $880,000 for brokering the deal.
Even as the company continued to be unprofitable and value rapidly fell, Trump paid himself a fat salary and even fatter bonuses. 

Trump was, in essence, paying himself a high salary for the trouble of running a company whose main purpose was to take enormous bad debts off Trump’s personal balance sheet and shift them over to the company.
The miracle by which Donald Trump got out of his billion dollar hole? He didn’t start a new business. He didn’t build a new building. He didn’t “create a lot of jobs.”

He turned a public company into his private dumping ground. He simply pushed all that debt across a line from “mine” to “theirs.” Then he collected a multimillion dollar check for the effort. Even after Trump had pushed all his personal debt onto the company, he continued to treat it like his personal toy.

As the company spiraled downward, it continued to pay for Trump’s luxuries. Between 1998 and 2005, it spent more than $6 million to “entertain high-end customers” on Trump’s plane and golf courses and about $2 million to maintain his personal jet and have it piloted, a Post analysis of company filings shows.
THCR went bankrupt, taking all the investors’ money—and all of Trump’s personal debt—with it.

Donald Trump got into debt because all the people who knew anything about casinos knew that his Atlantic City venture was a boondoggle, forcing him to use high-interest financing that could never be supported by the income. He got out of his debt by starting a public company so that people who didn’t know anything about the casino business could be convinced to swallow all the bills run up by Trump. Then he wrung the last dime out of the company … and threw it away."
100385,1002,Trump Campaign: ‘Clinton State Dept. Was … An Arm of the Clinton Foundation’,http://www.breitbart.com/big-government/2016/10/07/clinton-foundation-arm-state-department-trump/,15,"“The more that comes out, the clearer it is that the Clinton State Department was for all intents and purposes an arm of the Clinton Foundation,” declares Donald Trump’s senior communications adviser, Jason Miller.
“The fact that Hillary Clinton was handing out government contracts to family friends, siding with Clinton Foundation donors over human rights activists in Burma and having her aides coordinate activity between the State Department and her foundation is deeply troubling,” Miller continued.

“A Clinton White House would be more of the same but worse: the highest office in the land would be brimming with corruption and compromised by undue foreign influence.”

Miller was responding to an article by Betsy Woodruff published at the Daily Beast on Thursday afternoon, in which it was revealed that Clinton Foundation donors wanted Hillary Clinton’s State Department to open Burma to U.S. business interests, and “they got what they wanted.”

The opening to Burma was a matter of public record, announced by Secretary of State Clinton in May 2012. It was ostensibly justified by the once-isolated state’s movement toward democracy, particularly the election of formerly persecuted dissident and Nobel Peace Prize winner Aung San Suu Kyi to the presidency.

However, human-rights activists worried that opening Burma up to U.S. investment would set back their cause by empowering the military faction, known as the Tatmadaw, and making the wealth gap between average Burmese and their corrupt oligarchs even worse. Also, activists did not want to relieve the economic pressure on the Burmese government until vital reforms were made. Suu Kyi herself “supported a partial easing of the U.S. investment ban, but didn’t want American companies to be able to invest in the country’s energy sector.”

But U.S. investment in the energy sector was authorized by Clinton – just like “energy conglomerate Chevron and other generous donors to the Clinton Foundation wanted.” Burma was one of Chevron’s top lobbyist concerns at the time.

Those other generous Clinton Foundation donors, according to the Daily Beast’s research, included “Calvin Klein, General Motors, Boeing, ConocoPhillips, PriceWaterhouseCoopers, Gap, General Electric, Microsoft, PepsiCo, Coca-Cola and Procter & Gamble.”

Many of those entities are also members of the National Foreign Trade Council and US-ASEAN Business Council, two groups very eager for sanctions on Burma to be rolled back.

As an extra little bonus, Clinton singled out three Clinton Foundation donors – Boeing, Chevron, and General Motors – for praise during a November 2012 trade mission to Burma.

According to human rights activists quoted by the Daily Beast, the fears of those opposed to lifting Burma sanctions have come to pass, as the Clinton Foundation donors made a bundle, the Burmese people got very little, and the persecuted Rohingya, a Muslim minority group, have it worse than ever.

The Tatmadaw is still using rape and ethnic cleansing as weapons, and its critics worry that the deals facilitated by Clinton will continue providing it with much-desired hard currency.

The Daily Beast cites an October 2015 paper by the International Trade Union Confederation that noted “underage labor is still common in the country, including in the oil and mining industries——industries which have attracted Western investment.” Foreign investment is also said to be making land confiscation and violence against minority groups worse.

Miller’s charge that SecState Clinton was “handing out government contracts to family friends” refers to the Washington Free Beacon’s Thursday expose on Jacqueline Newmyer Deal, who has a defense consulting firm called the Long Term Strategy Group, and just happens to be a close friend of Chelsea Clinton.

Among the vast trove of emails Hillary Clinton hid from the American people were conversations that showed Clinton arranging meetings between Deal’s consulting firm and Pentagon officials involved in handing out contracts. Clinton specifically tried to help Deal “win a contract for consulting work with the State Department’s director of policy planning,” in Free Beacon writer Bill Gertz’s reading of the newly uncovered emails.

“Government cronyism, or the use of senior positions to help family friends, is not illegal. However, the practice appears to violate federal ethics rules that prohibit partiality, or creating the appearance of conflicts of interest,” Gertz pointed out.

“By now there is a strong pattern of Hillary Clinton showing bias in the dispensing of government funds and favors to a long list of friends, political supporters, and Clinton Foundation donors,” Ken Boehm of the National Legal and Policy Center told the Free Beacon. “It looks like she was single-handedly trying to revive the corrupt spoils system. As the old saying goes, sometimes things are what they look like.”

The Trump campaign also spotlighted a Washington Examiner article on the “intersection” of the Clinton Foundation, the State Department, and those unbelievably expensive speeches Bill Clinton was fond of giving.

The thrust of this article is that Hillary Clinton’s State Department staff spent a great deal of their time working with the Clinton Foundation to “perform donor maintenance, craft messaging on key policies and put together guest lists for both diplomatic and philanthropic events,” as well as helping Mr. Clinton with advice on “how to handle politically-fraught speaking engagements or foundation events.”

One such event involved bringing the new president of Libya to a Clinton Global Initiative meeting less than two weeks after the Benghazi atrocity. Things don’t get much more “fraught” than that.

The Examiner notes that Clinton’s ability to hide her emails, and turn them over to courts, Congress, and watchdog groups very slowly, have unquestionably helped her minimize the political damage from these revelations.

For example, we’re only just seeing information highly relevant to the outrageous abuse of power that allowed Clinton aide Huma Abedin to work lucrative side jobs for Clinton cronies at the same time she was drawing a paycheck from the U.S. taxpayer as a State Department employee, even though her work arrangement has been a topic of controversy, and congressional interest, for years.

Some of Hillary Clinton’s secrets will be kept until after Election Day, as the Examiner notes “at least a half-dozen Freedom of Information Act lawsuits for documents ranging from Bill Clinton’s speech schedules to internal discussions of the Keystone Pipeline” have been delayed until after November."
100386,1002,Paul Ryan Rejects Trump’s Call For Immigration Controls: We Need Foreign Workers To Milk Wisconsin Cows,http://www.breitbart.com/2016-presidential-race/2016/10/07/ryan-rejects-trumps-call-for-immigration-controls/,15,"House Speaker Paul Ryan is rejecting Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump’s call for new immigration controls that would boost wages for American workers and keep immigration levels within its historic norms.
Ryan instead said that he believes the nation’s immigration system is intended to help the economy and business interests, who want an increased flow of low-wage foreign labor.

“What I’ve always believed is that you need to retool the legal system so that it fits the economy’s needs,” Ryan said during a sit-down with the Atlantic’s Ronald Brownstein.

Brownstein asked Ryan about Trump’s Arizona immigration speech in which Trump called for the establishment of a “new immigration commission to develop a new set of reforms to our legal immigration system” such as enacting “new immigration controls to boost wages and to ensure that open jobs are offered to American workers first” and keeping “immigration levels, measured by population share, within historical norms.”

Trump had explained that between 1965 and 2015, the U.S. admitted 59 million immigrants. “Many of these arrivals have greatly enriched our country,” Trump said. “But we now have an obligation to them, and to their children, to control future immigration – as we have following previous immigration waves – to ensure assimilation, integration and upward mobility. Within just a few years immigration as a share of national population is set to break all historical records.”

Brownstein asked Ryan what he thought “about limiting immigration so that we maintain a certain population balance.”

“I’ve never looked at it like that,” Ryan said— later explaining that he did not support Trump’s call for immigration curbs because he wants to be able to import more foreign migrants into the country who will milk Wisconsin cows.

“[We need to] transition our legal system so visas are given to what are needed for the economy,” Ryan said. “Do we have a shortage of dairy workers in western Wisconsin? Yes, we do! Do we have a shortage of high-tech Silicon Valley software engineers? Boomers are retiring. We’re going to need medical professions. We’re going to need nurses and doctors… We’re going to need people.”

Ryan’s suggestion that there is a shortage of high-skilled tech workers is a favorite talking point amongst business interests and Silicon Valley executives, who stand to profit from an influx of low-wage foreign workers. However, it is a talking point that tech labor market experts have thoroughly debunked. U.S. Census data shows there are more than 11 million Americans with degrees with Science, Technology, Engineering and Math (STEM) who lack employment in these fields. In fact, U.S. schools are graduating two times more students with STEM degrees than are annually finding employment in these fields.

Ryan’s mention of low-skilled labor shortages amongst Wisconsin dairy farmers is equally interesting, as Ryan has previously suggested that an influx of low-skilled immigrant labor helps Wisconsin dairy farmers keep wages low. As Ryan told the National Journal in 2013:

“[Low-skilled immigrants] bring labor to our economy so jobs can get done. The dairy farmers in western Wisconsin are having a hard time finding anyone to help them produce their products, which are mostly cheese. If they can’t find workers, then they can’t produce, and we’ll end up importing. The flip side of the argument is: Just raise wages enough to attract people. But you raise wages too much in certain industries, then you’ll get rid of those industries, and we’ll just have to import.”

Ryan has repeatedly made the case for open borders immigration system. Under this globalist worldview, any willing employer should be able to hire any willing worker regardless of what country they live in. Under this theory, there is no limitation whatsoever to the amount of labor that can be imported into the country and, thus, there is no preference given to American citizens for jobs.

During his interview with Brownstein, Ryan went on to suggest that the country would soon face labor shortages of such a dire extreme that even if the U.S. were to employ all of the 94 million Americans outside of the labor force, there still would be U.S. jobs that would go unfilled. Ryan said:

“Even if we… get every able-bodied person out of welfare to work—there are 94 million able-bodied adults that aren’t in the workforce, some by choice, many not. Even if we get everybody off of welfare into work… we’re still going to have population needs because of the demographics in this country.”

Ryan suggested that the U.S. will “need” foreign workers to fill skill-sets that “cannot” be met by Americans.

“We’re going to need legal immigrants. So that means, in my mind, visas ought to be given based upon your contribution to society, your skill-set that is needed in our economy that cannot, is not, being filled by Americans.”

According to Pew polling data, 92 percent of the Republican electorate—and 83 percent of the American electorate overall—want to see immigration levels frozen or reduced. Based on Pew’s data, Ryan represents only a minuscule seven percent of the GOP electorate that wants to expand immigration levels."
100387,1002,Guilty as Sin: The Mainstream Media’s Double Standard on Ed Klein,http://www.breitbart.com/big-journalism/2016/10/07/ed-klein-guilty-as-sin-media-double-standard/,15,"Ed Klein’s newest book on Hillary Clinton, Guilty as Sin, was released this week — and mainstream media critics are trying to discredit both the book and its author with vitriolic, ad hominem, even profane attacks.
Olivia Nuzzi of the Daily Beast, for example, wrote that “at some point in the last quarter century, Klein lost his goddamn mind,” and that “he just makes shit up, and it’s not even good.” She cannot prove anything in the book is made up, of course — she simply chooses to believe that it is.

Klein has been a journalist for nearly six decades—seven of those years as foreign editor of Newsweek, ten years as the editor in chief of the New York Times Magazine (during which time the magazine won the first Pulitzer Prize in its history), and twenty-seven years as a contributing editor of Vanity Fair. Hence the nastiness with which his books about the Clintons, including the latest, are greeted by the media: he is an apostate of journalism’s left-wing political faith, and must be punished.

The media that otherwise applauds the fanciful behind-the-scenes drama in supposed tell-all books like Game Change, which ridiculed Sarah Palin and was turned into an HBO movie in time for the 2012 elections, dismisses Klein’s reporting on Hillary Clinton.

But Klein’s books about Hillary have featured exclusive interviews and news-breaking stories that other journalists have found hard to match. In many cases, these interviews and stories have proven to be illuminating — and often prescient.

In The Truth About Hillary (2005), Klein was the first journalist to prove that Hillary knew about Bill Clinton’s affair with Monica Lewinsky long before it became public, and that when the story broke she tried to pretend she was shocked. He also documented the original source of Hillary’s radical politics, the Reverend Don Jones, Hillary’s youth minister, who gave Hillary a subscription to motive, a leftwing publication that favored Cuba, socialism, and the Black Panthers. She would go on to write her senior thesis at Wellesley about radical community organizer Saul Alinsky, corresponding with Alinsky himself.

In The Amateur (2012), Klein unmasked Valerie Jarrett’s shadow presidency and her infighting with Obama’s first chief of staff, Rahm Emanuel. He also revealed Obama’s rift with Oprah Winfrey, who declined to campaign for Obama in 2012. The book came out in May; the New York Daily News reported on September 3 — nearly three months later — that Oprah would skip the Democratic National Convention. Later, in August, Klein reported that Obama offered the 2012 vice presidential spot to Clinton, a story that was confirmed a year later by Mark Halperin and John Heilemann in their book Double Down.

In Blood Feud (2014), Klein was the first journalist to report on the jealousy and antipathy that divide the Obamas and the Clintons. The hatred between the Clintons and Obamas was substantiated two years later, on September 16, 2016, when Colin Powell’s emails were leaked to the public. Klein also reported, correctly, that Hillary knew from the beginning that the attack on the U.S. consulate in Benghazi was carried out by an affiliate of al Qaeda. And he was the first journalist to uncover the true story of Hillary’s fainting spell and concussion while she was secretary of state, anticipating new doubts about her health.

Nuzzi calls Klein’s books “narrative fiction,” which better describes Hillary Clinton’s stories about herself. Clinton’s more egregious biographical whoppers — the Tuzla dash, for example — are largely buried and forgotten, while the media spends months lending undue credibility to her lies about a YouTube video in Benghazi, or about never sending classified material on her private email server, before finally admitting the truth and then promptly ignoring it, once she is past the worst danger.

Klein relies heavily on unnamed sources, and dialogue that is reconstructed second- or even third-hand. That is fair game for criticism, as is his writing style, which tends toward the dramatic. And every journalist is bound to make a mistake or two.

But many journalists, including Halperin and Heinemann of Game Change renown, use information from anonymous sources to tell important stories that otherwise would go unreported. Why are their stories about Sarah Palin widely believed, while Klein’s stories about Hillary Clinton are treated as toxic until proven true?

The answer is too obvious to require explanation."
100388,1003,White Christian Male America’s Sad Final Stand,http://www.huffingtonpost.com/paul-raushenbush/white-christian-male-amer_b_12395608.html?utm_hp_ref=politics&ir=Politics,15,"The results of the Presidential elections of 2008 and 2012 demonstrated a consensus among the voters from almost every different religious and secular groups that Barack Obama was the best choice to represent the diverse tapestry that is America. As I wrote on the day after election day of 2012 in a piece called A New Day for Religion in America :

“People of all races, ages, and cultures stood side by side as they showed their appreciation for a president who himself represents a mix of race, religion and cultures. Yesterday America voted to recognize and celebrate our diversity and reaffirm our deep commitment and responsibility to one another.”
2016 is shaping up in similar ways as the new reality of demographic shifts are even more powerfully influencing this election cycle. As Robby Jones made plain, White Christian America is ending, and in its place a multi-cultural, multi-racial, multi-religious nation is emerging.

Of course, not everyone is celebrating. The one religious demographic group that voted against Obama in ‘08 and again in ‘12 can be broadly described as White Christians. And this same group is the one religious group that is against Hillary in 2016 — supporting Trump over Clinton at a 2 to 1 margin according to the PRRI/The Atlantic Survey.

At the heart of these odd bedfellow of Trump and Christian America is the fear of the loss of privilege — privilege of a “White America’, privilege of a “Christian America”, privilege of a ‘Straight America’, and, today, we have to especially name — privilege of a “Male America.” These privileges are on their way out although far too slowly. And like an animal wounded but not yet vanquished, the claim on privilege is yielding a dangerous phase of transition in our nation.

We are in the midst of an example of the weirdness of this demise as White Conservative Christians in recent days have found themselves twisting to avoid or defend the candidate who was caught on tape saying extraordinarily derogatory things towards women, indicating a deep rooted disregard for women’s bodies, wellbeing, or the sanctity of their relationships. He glorified himself indicating that his celebrity allowed him to be beyond normal rules of decency, and, in his non-apology, seemed completely unaware of the depths of his own depravity.

And yet, thus far, I have not seen any White Christian Trump supporter renounce him. This can only be because of their white knuckle grasp on the desperate hope that he represents for their privileged position in American society. Perhaps the captains White Christian Men America will come out and say no, this is where we must part ways. But I doubt it. All this is sad and predictable and in my language sinful in that it seems completely out of whack with their own proclaimed core Christian beliefs.

But there is good news as well!

I count myself among the growing number of White Christians who embrace the diversity that is and will continue to be America. I, and millions of White Christians with me, are praying for a more inclusive, welcoming society where no one group lives in isolated privilege from others and who recognize that I am a better Christian when my religious and non-religious neighbors have the exact same respect and dignity as I enjoy in my own faith.

And I am also one of the millions and millions of White Christians who support HIllary Clinton for President because she has explicitly embraced the many different diversities of our nation, and a committment to justice for all our citizens, especially citizens of color. and represents the best choice for our county to continue our pilgrimage towards living out the promise of E Pluribus Unum,"
100389,1003,How Clinton and Trump Could Win the Next Debate,http://www.huffingtonpost.com/tomas-chamorropremuzic-phd/how-clinton-and-trump-cou_b_12390602.html?utm_hp_ref=politics,15,"Around 85 million people tuned in to watch the first Clinton versus Trump debate. Although this is a staggering audience, and upcoming debates may be expected to attract a similar number of viewers, televised debates don’t matter as much as we think. Consider the fact that there is not much agreement on the outcome of the first debate, and even the biggest win awarded to either candidate (a 4% gain to Clinton) is still within the margin of error for an election prediction.

To be sure, nothing would suit the media more than a critical incident that ends up influencing the election result, and it has happened before: e.g., Nixon’s sweat, Al Gore’s sighing, or Reagan’s jokes. The problem with such incidents is that, contrary to popular belief and the media’s wishes, they reveal very little about a candidate’s actual presidential potential. Just because we live in an age of media politics does not mean that what we really need is an entertainer-in-chief rather than a competent leader!

And yet, both candidates will do what they can to make the most of the next debates. The stakes are obviously very high, but the chances of successfully influencing pubic opinion - and shifting votes - are rather lower. In that sense presidential debates are like playing the lottery: there’s a big prize for winning but no clear formula for winning the prize.

The best candidates can do, and one can only imagine that an army of spin doctors and PR consultants is working full-time to help them achieve this, is to effectively manage their impressions. That is, to carefully craft their message and behaviors so as to upgrade their reputation with viewers, in particular undecided voters.

Although this is more art than science, here are a few evidence-based recommendations that the candidates may wish to consider to win the next debate:

What Clinton Could Do to Win:

Clinton’s biggest problem is that many voters don’t have a clear understanding of who she is. Politicians are like brands, and the stronger they are the more clearly they convey the attributes and style that makes them different from others. Whether you like Trump or not, it is very easy to understand what he stands for, and despite his alleged improvised style his behavior is fairly predictable, which is an asset when it comes to attracting votes. Thus the best strategy for Clinton is to repeat the same strategy she used during the first debate, where she combined the traditional style of a mainstream politician with some seemingly engineered calmness and humor. The Trump campaign will no doubt attack her for being overly scripted and “inauthentic”, but that is what politicians are. If Clinton can demonstrate that over three debates this strategy is sufficient to resist Trump’s attacks and even unsettle him, she may win some more votes.

Another perceived weakness that Clinton should try to address is her alleged emotionality. Perhaps because she is a woman, many viewers including traditional democrat voters perceive that Clinton is too emotionally sensitive and vulnerable to be president, which questions her ability to handle pressure. Conversely, Trump’s overconfident style plus his incomparable ability to draw media attention may suggest that he is immune to pressure. The best Clinton can do to persuade skeptics that she is mentally tough enough is to avoid reacting to Trump’s provocations. She managed to do this well during the first debate, responding to most provocations with a smile, and appearing to expect them. The same approach should work again - the calmer she stays, the more annoyed Trump will get, which will turn his aggression against him.

A final point Clinton may want to consider is how she can expose Trump’s weaknesses. From the first debate we have learned that his biggest deficits are in the area of content: Trump appeared to run out of ideas (and started repeating himself) after the first 30 minutes. The split screen also portrayed him as fairly out of depth with regards to technical facts, as if she could make stuff up without him noticing. Although it is true that voters appear not to care much about accuracy these days, just like Trump will attempt to make Clinton look irritable and emotionally vulnerable, Clinton should attempt to make Trump seem uninformed. Few qualities are more important for leadership than good judgment, and while Trump may benefit from not having a record as a politician it is hard to demonstrate potential for leadership in the absence of knowledge and expertise.

What Trump Could Do to Win:

The most effective strategy pursued by Trump during the first debate was to remind viewers that whatever Clinton says she is just a politician. This would work on his favor again given that most people around the world are disenchanted with the political establishment and, whatever Clinton does or says, she is clearly an emblematic member of that establishment. Since Trump’s biggest asset is not being a politician, and Clinton cannot pretend not to be one, this is a strong card in Trump’s hands. At the end of day, much like with Brexit, many people prefer a complete wild card than more of the same guaranteed - because they for sure are unhappy with the status quo.

In addition, Trump could do more to exploit Clinton’s past records. During the first debate he seemed too unfocused and impatient to let Clinton respond to his criticisms (e.g., the e-mail scandal, her decisions as foreign secretary, and her changing views on key policy issues). Good leaders are seen as trustworthy, which comes as a byproduct of good judgment and integrity. Instead of threatening to talk about her husband’s affairs or what she said about Obama when she campaigned against him, Trump should question Clinton about her track record. Past behavior is a good predictor of future behavior, and this is no doubt Trump’s best weapon against Clinton.

Finally, for all the talks that Trump needs to appear more “presidential” - which presumably means seeming more composed, politically correct, and less aggressive - he has gotten this far for exactly the opposite reasons. It is indeed his outrageousness, unconventionality, and bravado that have helped him destroy his political opponents and gained an unexpectedly large and loyal support base. While it may be reassuring for undecided voters to see that Trump is less of a risk than his critics have stated, that case is now hard to make, for there is too much evidence for the contrary. In short, Trump needs to hope that he can still persuade undecided voters that an entertaining, over-the-top, TV personality is preferable to a conventional politician. If that is the case, then the last thing he would want is to seem presidential."
100390,1003,Is It Possible to Reconcile with Trump Voters?,http://www.huffingtonpost.com/bob-burnett/is-it-possible-to-reconci_b_12386346.html?utm_hp_ref=politics,15,"The last question asked in the October 4th vice-presidential was on a subject all Americans should worry about: “It has been a divisive campaign... if your ticket wins, what specifically are you going to do to unify the country and reassure the people who voted against you?” Democrat Tim Kaine replied that he was confident that Hillary Clinton could unify the US because she is a proven conciliator. Republican Mike Pence asserted Donald Trump would unify the country by making “America great again.”

If Clinton wins, is unity possible?

The latest Huffington Post Poll of Polls shows Hillary Clinton leading Donald Trump 48.4 percent to 41.6 percent. Probably the hard-core Trump base is around 30 percent of voters.

Two years ago, Pew Research released a “Typology of American politics.” The Pew typology distinguished between three classes of voters: the general public, registered voters, and the “politically engaged.” In the category “politically engaged” there were three categories of Republicans: “Steadfast Conservatives: socially conservative populists” at 19 percent; “Business Conservatives: Pro-Wall street, pro-immigrant” at 17 percent; and “Young Outsiders: conservative views on government, not on social issues” at 11 percent. The hard-core Trump base is probably composed of “Steadfast Conservatives” and “Young Outsiders” for 30 percent — roughly the size of the Tea Party movement.

In March, Bill Moyers interviewed Dr. Robert Jones, whose organization conducted the “American Values Survey.” Dr. Jones said that Trump voters: “... are best understood not as values voters, not even as Tea Party voters, but as nostalgia voters, these voters that are looking back to — they’re culturally and economically disaffected voters that are anxious to hold on to a white conservative Christian culture that’s passing from the scene.” The Trump voters are united by their skepticism about government: both the perceived failings of the Obama Administration (and, by association, Hillary Clinton) and their negative feelings about immigration.

Berkeley Professor Lawrence Rosenthal, , Executive Director of the Center for Right-Wing Studies,has amplified this description. Rosenthal says Trump supporters are a new form of right-wing populism — a blend of the Tea Party plus the “alt-right” (“a rebranding of classic white nationalism.”) They are united by their disdain for immigrants and “elites,” including Wall Street, Washington, and Hollywood. They feel “their” country slipping away and believe their children will have a tougher life than they do. (Rosenthal observed that, before Trump, the model for these voters was Sarah Palin, who during her 2008 campaign for Vice President, expressed the same anger and disdain for political correctness.)

In an August 15th study for the Gallup organization, Jonathan Rockwell offered a more nuanced view of Trump voters: “His supporters are less educated and more likely to work in blue collar occupations, but they earn relatively high household incomes... no other presidential candidate from either party received greater support from places with high white mortality, high segregation, and low mobility.” In other words, the Trump voters live in segregated failing communities. They are angry and Trump has channeled this anger.

The New Yorker’s George Saunders observed the Trump campaign: “From the beginning, America has been of two minds about the Other. One mind says, be suspicious of it, dominate it, deport it, exploit it, enslave it, kill it as needed. The other mind denies that there can be any such thing as the Other, in the face of the claim that all are created equal... The first mind has always held violence nearby, to use as needed.” Trump voters are those who hold the first mind; who are extremely fearful of “the Other.”

Trump has ruthlessly exploited this base and amplified their fear. New Yorker contributor Saunders characterized Trump as “a fan of winning by any means necessary, exploiting our recent dullness and our aversion to calling stupidity, stupidity.”

Hillary Clinton will likely become the 45th president. Her biggest challenge will be unifying the country, particularly the hardcore Trump voters. It will be a daunting task.

Writing in the Huffington Post , liberal commentator Robert Kuttner lamented that Trump has unloosed “the forces of real hate... Trump will have goons as poll watchers. He will find ways to insist that the election was stolen. He will continue to make more mischief, impeaching the legitimacy of our institutions.”

All voters should hope that Hillary Clinton is as good at reconciliation as her running-mate, Tim Kaine, says she is. After the election, Hillary will reach out to Trump voters but they won’t take her seriously. To bridge the social chasm between her advocates and the Trump folks, Hillary will have to provide real economic change (good jobs and a lessening of inequality). Hillary will have to give them a reason to be hopeful, convince that America really is great."
100391,1004,All Eyes On Ryan After Trump's Predatory Comments About Women Surface,http://talkingpointsmemo.com/livewire/all-eyes-on-paul-ryan-trump-predatory-comments,15,"On Friday, the Washington Post revealed that Trump had made a series of predatory and vulgar remarks about how he tried to seduce women while filming with Billy Bush of ""Access Hollywood"" in 2005. The revelation came just hours before House Speaker Paul Ryan (R-WI) was scheduled to appear for the first time with his Republican presidential nominee—in his own backyard, no less.

After several calls Friday afternoon, Ryan's office still hadn't returned TPM's requests for comment about whether Ryan still planned to appear with Trump Saturday in Wisconsin.

Since the beginning, Trump and Ryan's relationship has been under a microscope. Ryan, a conservative policy stalwart, initially declined to endorse Trump. Then, after Ryan finally did declare his support for the party's haphazard nominee, the House speaker spent months on Capitol Hill distancing himself from Trump on everything from his attacks on a ""Mexican"" judge to his aspersions on a Gold Star family.

Trump was so offended by Ryan's tepid support that he temporarily refused to endorse Ryan in his primary, which Ryan went on to win in a landslide.

Ryan's endorsement has given the speaker a tortured few months, although of course, it has always been within his power to walk away. He hasn't, yet.

With Trump sinking in the polls, a historic House majority on the line in November's election, and his own political future to consider, however, this may be the last, best chance Ryan has to ditch the top of the ticket."
100392,1004,Trump Allies Scramble To Downplay Predatory Remarks About Women,http://talkingpointsmemo.com/livewire/trump-surrogates-defend-comments,15,"Donald Trump's allies rode to his rescue late Friday and attempted to downplay predatory and lewd comments about women he made in a leaked video from 2005, which gained serious media attention Friday after it was published by the Washington Post.

Trump's former campaign manager and current CNN contributor Corey Lewandowski called into the network to say that the comments were not a big deal because America is picking a president, not a ""Sunday school teacher.""

""I think what this comes down to, clearly this is not how women should be spoken about. But we're not choosing a Sunday school teacher here, and what we know about Donald Trump, this is 12 years ago, this audiotape,"" he said. ""It does not reflect or bring to mind the Donald Trump I spent 18 months with traveling. I never heard anything like this out of him.""

He went on to say that the revelation should not be enough to make voters switch their support to Hillary Clinton, and deflected attention to the speeches Clinton gave to Wall Street firms, arguing that there could be a “bombshell” in the unreleased transcripts.

""We don't have any understanding of what Hillary Clinton has said in those meetings with Wall Street where she was paid for these speeches. For all we know, the same things are being said in that regard,"" he said. ""I don't know if that's the case, and I don't think that the Trump campaign wanted this or knew this was available to come out during October. I'm sure that would be the case strategically. But what we don't know is what Hillary Clinton has said in some of these speeches because she refuses to release the audio. Do we have a bombshell in there? I don't know the answer.""

A spokesman for Trump's former opponent and current advisor Ben Carson told BuzzFeed simply that the ""flesh can be weak.""

“Hey, the flesh can be weak, my man,"" Armstrong Williams told the site.

“Dr. Carson believes that people can change and be better,” he added, according to BuzzFeed. “You know, these things happen. I’m sure somebody could find a video of Bill Clinton talking like this — are we gonna say Bill Clinton was the same person as president that he is today? Obviously not.”

Ralph Reed, a member of Trump's religious advisory board and the founder of the Faith and Freedom Coalition, told CNN's Ashley Killough that he believes Trump's comments rank ""pretty low"" as concerns for voters.

""I've listened to the tape, my view is that people of faith are voting for president on issues like who will defend and protect unborn life, defund Planned Parenthood, grow the economy and create jobs, and oppose the Iran nuclear deal,"" Reed said. ""I think a 10-year-old-tape of a private conversation ranks pretty low on their hierarchy of the their concerns.""

Trump's Virginia Campaign chair said people are more concerned with the economy than with Trump's sexually aggressive remarks on women, according to WUSA's Garrett Haake.

""This is the kind of stuff that nobody cares about,"" he said. ""People are worried about the economy.""

Former Rep. Michelle Bachmann (R-MN) tried to spin the release of the old tape as a Clinton campaign attack. There’s no evidence the Clinton campaign leaked the tape to the Washington Post.

""Hillary Clinton wanted to make sure that this is what America would be talking about, so they did their opposition research, this is what they had,” she told MSNBC’s Chris Matthews. ""But quite honestly, I think that when it comes to Sunday night, you're going to hear Donald Trump talking about the issues, no matter how this comes up, she wants to make sure Anderson Cooper or someone in the audience brings this up. But quite honestly, I think she had a really bad news day herself."""
100393,1004,McCain: Trump Should 'Suffer The Consequences' For Explicit Comments,http://talkingpointsmemo.com/livewire/mccain-rebukes-trump-too,15,"Sen. John McCain (R-AZ) released a statement Friday night that was his strongest criticism yet of his Republican Presidential nominee Donald Trump.

After audio and video were released by the Washington Post Friday of Trump making explicit and predatory comments about women, McCain said that Trump should ""suffer the consequences"" for his actions.

""There are no excuses for Donald Trump’s offensive and demeaning comments. No woman should ever be victimized by this kind of inappropriate behavior. He alone bears the burden of his conduct and alone should suffer the consequences,"" McCain said in a statement from his campaign Friday night.

McCain, a former Republican presidential nominee himself, has steadfastly continued to endorse Trump even after Trump criticized McCain for being captured as a prisoner of war in Vietnam.

McCain joined several Republican presidential candidates who criticized Trump's comments Friday night. There was still no indication that any of the senators who had endorsed Trump were pulling their endorsements."
100394,1005,"Despite Hurricane, Florida Governor Refuses to Extend Voter Registration",http://www.motherjones.com/politics/2016/10/rick-scott-florida-hurricane-matthew-voter-registration,15,"Florida Gov. Rick Scott said he will not extend the state's voter registration deadline in light of Hurricane Matthew, the deadly storm currently barreling through the state with winds over 120 mph. The Republican governor, who also heads a super-PAC supporting Donald Trump, insisted that despite the dangerous hurricane, people have had ample time to register ahead of the October 11 deadline.

""On top of that, we've got lots of opportunities to vote: early voting, absentee voting, and Election Day,"" Scott said on Thursday night. ""So I don’t intend to make any changes.""

His refusal follows a request from Hillary Clinton's campaign to issue an extension in the all-important swing state to allow last-minute voters to participate in the November election.

""Our hope would be that a little bit more time will be given for people who were expecting to be able to get registered before the election,"" Robby Mook, Clinton's campaign manager, told reporters. ""We certainly expect that the governor and local officials will make that possible.""

Scott previously urged residents in vulnerable coastal towns to evacuate, warning that the hurricane could potentially ""kill people.""

Trump is currently lagging behind his Democratic rival in several key swing states, including Florida, with a Quinnipiac poll this week reporting 46 percent of voters favoring Clinton, to 41 percent for Trump."
100395,1005,Exclusive: Central Park Five Members Blast Trump for Insisting They're Guilty,http://www.motherjones.com/politics/2016/10/central-park-five-blast-donald-trump-exclusive,15,"After Donald Trump reaffirmed his long-held belief this week that the men known as the Central Park Five were guilty in an infamous, decades-old rape case, two members of the since-exonerated group blasted Trump in interviews with Mother Jones, calling him a ""stunt artist"" and saying ""he's gotten worse"" since his involvement in their 1990 conviction.

""You have a person who's supposed to be a very intelligent business man, and what I'm sure he would do if he was trying to purchase a property is do his due diligence,"" Yusef Salaam told me Friday, noting that Trump continued to ignore the facts of the Central Park Five case. ""For somebody to still stand on the side of injustice like Donald Trump is, that becomes a very scary place to be.""

""For somebody to still stand on the side of injustice like Donald Trump is, that becomes a very scary place to be.""
In a statement to CNN this week, Trump said he still believed the Central Park Five were guilty. ""They admitted they were guilty,"" he told CNN's Miguel Marquez. ""The police doing the original investigation say they were guilty. The fact that the case was settled with so much evidence against them is outrageous. And the woman, so badly injured, will never be the same.""

In 1989, five black and Latino teenagers were convicted of brutally attacking a young white jogger in New York City's Central Park. The crime, which came at the height of the crack epidemic and skyrocketing crime rates, enflamed racial tension in the city. About two weeks after the incident, Trump published a full-page ad in four major New York newspapers calling for the teens to be brought to justice—and suggesting that they should face the death penalty. But in 2002, all five men—who spent between 6 and 13 years in prison—were exonerated based on DNA evidence and a confession from the actual perpetrator, whose DNA was shown to match evidence at the scene.

Mother Jones talked to two members of the Central Park Five—Salaam and Korey Wise—about Trump's role in their case, their thoughts on his presidential candidacy, and his latest comments about their case. Not surprisingly, neither is happy to see one of their main antagonists on the national stage day in and day out. Nor is a third member of the group, Raymond Santana, who skewered Trump on Twitter: Salaam, who was 15 when he was jailed for the assault, said he believes Trump played a crucial role in the media campaign against him.

""[Trump] was one of the fire starters—really the main fire starter—because his name held a lot more weight,"" he said. His ad facilitated ""the conviction that was going to happen in the public arena prior to us even getting into the courthouse.""

Wise told me he only learned about Trump's ad after watching a documentary on his case several years ago. After seeing it, he understood why the case had become so incredibly charged. ""I said, 'Wow! Wow! Wow!'"" Wise said. ""This is where a great deal of the energy that was directed at me in terms of physical threats"" came from.

""The ad was talking about and goes specifically into fears that the public was having at that particular time,"" Salaam told me. ""He's talking about how 'we've had to give up our leisurely stroll in the playground, and we can't ride our bikes, or we can't walk around in the streets because now we're hostages, ruled by the laws of the streets.'"" Trump has revisited those themes in his presidential campaign, often citing gun violence in cities like Chicago as indicative of a breakdown in ""law and order,"" which he insists he can restore.

""If he becomes president, what is that going to mean for the people who are losing their lives in the street?""
Salaam also suggested that Trump was a hypocrite for attacking Hillary Clinton over her ""superpredator"" remarks in the first presidential debate. ""She well within her right could have said, 'Well you took out a full-page ad calling for the execution—the lynching, the death—of young black and Latino men—and you have never apologized.'""

More than 25 years later, Trump hasn't changed, Salaam said. ""As a matter of fact, he's gotten worse,"" he said. ""He believes in everything he's put out there—the racial vision he's created.""

For his part, Wise said he doesn't think about what a Trump presidency would mean because he doesn't take him seriously: ""He's a stunt artist…He follows publicity.""

But Salaam had a bleaker assessment of what the country would look like with Trump as commander in chief: ""If he becomes president, what is that going to mean for the people who are losing their lives in the street? This 'law and order' is going to be a very, very scary thing for us as a people."""
100396,1005,Rudy Giuliani's Daughter Is Definitely Voting for Clinton,http://www.motherjones.com/politics/2016/10/rudy-giulianis-daughter-most-definitely-voting-hillary-clinton,15,"Throughout Donald Trump's rise to the top of the Republican party, Rudy Giuliani has emerged as one of the real estate mogul's most emphatic surrogates, consistently backing Trump even at his most controversial moments.

But don't expect the children of New York City's former mayor to share his enthusiasm. Yep, Politico reports Caroline Rose Giuliani intends to vote for Hillary Clinton, a woman her father once described as ""too stupid"" to be president. And unlike other children of prominent Republican families who have stopped short of a full endorsement of Clinton, Caroline has made her choice crystal clear: Caroline told Politico that her father is aware of her intentions to cast her vote for Clinton, insisting that he's ""fully comfortable"" with the decision. But based on Giuliani's recent assertion that Trump is more fit for office because Clinton is a woman, we're guessing that dad's relaxed response might have more to do with indifference to his daughter's political preferences. After all, she's a woman too."
100397,1006,“Open trade and open borders”: Wikileaks releases excerpts from Hillary’s long-missing Wall Street speeches,http://hotair.com/archives/2016/10/07/open-trade-open-borders-wikileaks-releases-excerpts-hillarys-long-missing-wall-street-speeches/,15,"I wonder if this Wikileaks dump was in the works for this afternoon all along or if it was rushed out to try to give the media something juicy to talk about besides … well, you know.

It was planned for today, I’m guessing, simply because there isn’t much that’s sensational in the excerpts from her speeches featured in one of John Podesta’s leaked emails. This section is worth flagging, though, both for the right and the left.

*Hillary Clinton Said Her Dream Is A Hemispheric Common Market, With Open Trade And Open Markets. *

“My dream is a hemispheric common market, with open trade and open borders, some time in the future with energy that is as green and sustainable as we can get it, powering growth and opportunity for every person in the hemisphere.” [05162013 Remarks to Banco Itau.doc, p. 28]…

*“Secondly, I think we have to have a concerted plan to increase trade already under the current circumstances, you know, that Inter-American Development Bank figure is pretty surprising. There is so much more we can do, there is a lot of low hanging fruit but businesses on both sides have to make it a priority and it’s not for governments to do but governments can either make it easy or make it hard and we have to resist, protectionism, other kinds of barriers to market access and to trade and I would like to see this get much more attention and be not just a policy for a year under president X or president Y but a consistent one.” [05162013 Remarks to Banco Itau.doc, p. 32]
She’s talking about trade there more so than immigration, but obviously the free flow of labor across borders is a key part of what she has in mind. The left will probably find her comments more scandalous than the right for the simple reason that Team Clinton really makes no bones about being for open borders in their public comments on the subject. Remember this from a few weeks ago? Remember Hillary vowing to build on Obama’s executive amnesties by allowing the illegal-immigrant parents of DREAMers to reside lawfully in the U.S.? Even by the usual Democratic standards, she’s an open-borders shill par excellence. It wouldn’t surprise me, frankly, if her team nudges Hispanic media to notice this passage as proof that she’s as pro-immigration in private as she is on the stump.

The “open trade” part is more of a problem. Ryan-style conservatives will find that reassuring, but Trump-style nationalists will take it as a reminder of why Clinton must be defeated next month. And more importantly, so might some Bernie fans on the left. Hillary’s done a solid job lately of consolidating her party. The Quinnipiac poll that was released today showing her ahead by five points nationally is noteworthy for how much she’s gained among the 18-34 group in the last few weeks at the expense of Gary Johnson and Jill Stein: A lot of young progressives who were wary of her have evidently decided recently to suck it up and back her in the name of beating Trump. But that’s due partly to the fact that she spent months pandering to them in the primaries on trade. She claimed she had changed her mind on TPP and now opposed it, and she even began to make some anti-NAFTA noises despite the fact that it’s Bill Clinton’s signature that’s on that law. She can’t afford to lose those lukewarm progressives again. Team Trump should be beaming out these “open trade” remarks online and in interviews all weekend. Although, at this point, they might have trouble getting anyone’s attention because of … well, you know.

In other news, Hillary also sounded pretty excited about single-payer health care in one of these speeches, which might help smooth any ruffled feathers on the left over trade. I guess she and Trump have something in common after all."
100398,1006,What Bill Weld actually said about focusing on Trump,http://hotair.com/archives/2016/10/07/bill-weld-actually-said-focusing-trump/,15,"A major kerfuffle happened earlier this week when The Boston Globe reported Libertarian vice presidential nominee Bill Weld was going to focus on Donald Trump over Hillary Clinton. Both New York Magazine and New York Daily News suggested Weld was “giving up,” while Vice News claimed he was endorsing Clinton without actually endorsing her. AP has a pretty good analysis of what was going on, although he may (may) seem to be falling into the “Weld is really re-thinking his decision to be on the Libertarian ticket” camp.

Weld is denying any such thoughts. He posted on Facebook how he believed Johnson was the best candidate for 2016, and that wasn’t going to change.

“Gary Johnson and I are committed to offering voters a way to break up the two-party duopoly that has given us policy paralysis and divisiveness with which most Americans cannot identify. If one of the results of what we are doing is that the two so-called major parties temper their hyper-partisanship, then so be it. That would be a good thing for the country.

Let there be no doubt. I am the Libertarian nominee for Vice-President, proudly running with Gov. Gary Johnson, and both Gary and I will be running hard and making our case right up until the polls close on November 8. Our ambition is to serve our country.”
Weld also criticized both Senator Tim Kaine and Governor Mike Pence on Twitter during Tuesday’s VP debate, and also said neither candidate “was persuasive” on how they wanted to unify the country. So it’s not like he spent the debate propping up the Clinton campaign. To suggest otherwise is foolish, but that’s something the media seems to be more interested in doing these days. Blame Carl Bernstein for that, and others for taking some of Weld’s comments out of context (how can you say Weld endorsed Clinton, when all he did was say she had a great resume but bad policies? C’mon man…).

It should also be pointed out the claim Weld tried to get the ticket flipped wouldn’t work. Carla Howell with the Libertarian Party told me the idea of switching the ticket to Weld/Johnson isn’t feasible.

“Many states have print ballots already. Some have mailed absentee ballots.

The bylaws require that delegates to the Libertarian Nominating Convention (held in May this year) select the presidential and vice presidential candidates.”
It’s possible it was researched at some point, but it probably would have had to have been very early in the campaign.

One thing which is really interesting is a comment Weld told Reason saying he “would be emphasizing” where he thought Trump was “wrong-headed,” but also said he’d been doing that since “Day One.” I wrote a theory in August suggesting Weld was picked as the vice presidential nominee because he could draw in someone like Mitt Romney. It was just a guess because of Weld’s ties to the party, and the respect he had in the Northeast. After all, Johnson has this weird, goofy charisma which does attract Millennials. He’s gotten the Clinton camp so worried, they had to push Al Gore out on the campaign trail to help attract Millennials on global warming.

Johnson Weld 2016 communications director Joe Hunter had a very curious quote, when I asked if that was the strategy between the Weld pick (emphasis mine).

“The fact that Gov. Johnson connects well with Millennials and that Gov. Weld has appeal to disaffected Republicans isn’t a strategy. It just is.”
Hmm.

There is a bit of a risk with this, because there are libertarians (or libertarian-leaning folks) who aren’t interested in Johnson. A lot of them appear to be disaffected Austin Petersen supporters, who aren’t listening to Petersen’s pleas to vote Johnson in November. It’s possible they’re more purist libertarians, and their critiques of Johnson aren’t wrong. But he is the best alternative to a Clinton or Trump presidency. Johnson may be trying to prove this to Millennials, and teach them they’re really libertarian, not democratic socialists, while Weld can talk to disaffected Republicans who really don’t want to vote Clinton, but sure aren’t interested in picking Trump. Considering the fact Jeb Bush allegedly told people at Manhattan Institute to “vote Johnson,” there may be some truth to this idea.

As for a November victory, Johnson isn’t foolish. He knows the road is tough because he’s not in the debates. Johnson has long said the only way he could win outright would be if he were on the debate stage with Clinton and Trump. It won’t happen on Sunday, and might not happen for the third debate (unless Clinton and Trump do so horribly they cause even more people look elsewhere). A large part of this is the Presidential Commission on Debates, which does its best to insure only Republicans and Democrats are on stage (15% threshold…really?). What they really should consider is putting candidates on stage who are on the ballot in all 50 states. This would definitely get the Libertarian Party up there, and might leave the door open for candidates like Jill Stein or Darrell Castle to take the stage too. It does run the risk of having to form coalition governments, but it could also lead to a complete reshuffling of American politics, with more “big government” supporters coming together, while “freedom lovers” coalesce somewhere else."
100399,1006,5 takeaways from the Trump-Clinton debate that hasn’t happened yet,http://hotair.com/what-donald-trumps-debate-strategy-should-be/2016/10/07/what-trump-needs-to-do-against-clinton/,15,"The second and most important presidential debate for Donald Trump comes Sunday night.

If what you read the morning after the St. Louis town hall isn’t something resembling this post, then the billionaire’s gone bankrupt again. You can bend over and kiss your Trump goodbye:

Donald Trump bounced back Sunday night from a disappointing opening debate 11 days ago. He was poised. He was pointed. Most importantly, he was plausibly presidential.

Open-minded voters (there are several left) were not invited to fear a President Trump mocking a foreign leader’s stature or accent in English. Or speculating on the developing weight problem of Britain’s new prime minister, Theresa May.

Trump actually started out well back on Sept. 26. But as Allahpundit pointed out here, after 30 minutes Trump’s ego could no longer resist Hillary Clinton’s tempting bait.

Even without her little riser, Clinton should have been a push-over for the reality TV celebrity. She used to be the worst candidate in modern memory. Now, thanks to Aleppo Johnson she’s only second-worst. But that’s nothing to cough at.

To anyone who can endure her voice long enough, Clinton warned during her convention speech how easily Trump is baited. She may lie about her emails, Benghazi, the Clinton Foundation and Chelsea-knows-what-else. But the former lawyer, former first lady, former senator and former secretary of State was dead-on about trolling Trump.

Insults. Taxes. Bills. Beauty queens. Bankruptcies. Everything she tossed out caused Trump to make a long, defensive explanation, wasting his precious TV time on Clinton points in front of nearly 90 million people.

Worse, it kept Trump from epoxying Democrat Clinton to Barack Obama as the most status quo of status quo candidates at a time when two-of-three Americans know the country is on the wrong track. If you want more of this malaise, folks, stick with Hillary. Instead, subsequent polls showed serious erosion in Trump’s standing on issues.

This debate, however, came smack dab in the center of angry, worried flyover-country. One-issue-after-another Trump went after Clinton for her trade flip-flops, for the jobs her one-sided trade agreements cost America, for her failed Russian reset.

For the useless war she championed in Libya that produced another failed state and for her sadly wince-able claim that no Americans lost their life there. Breaking news to Benghazi families.

And how, Mrs. Clinton, did you come up with that cockamamie anti-Muslim video fable so Obama could get to his Vegas fundraisers on time?

Clinton tried to defend herself. But Trump’s barrage just kept landing. What about pushing to get U.S. troops out of Iraq allowing ISIS to germinate? That awful one-sided deal with Iran? And your promise, Madame Secretary, to destroy thousands of coal jobs? How does that make Americans ‘Stronger Together’?

What about your national security failures? How can we trust you with nuclear codes if you knowingly send state secrets on an email system less secure than g-mail? Average people need Google maps to follow your intentionally arcane explanations that turn out false anyway.

Last Sunday, Clinton’s elfish VP partner Tim Kaine revealed their campaign strategy: Throw everything at the Trump campaign and force it to explain.

Except – Oops! – Mike Pence is a professional politician of the kind Trumpers profess disdain. He saved Trump’s south side, handing the top of the ticket last night’s second-chance.

The GOP vice presidential nominee looks like every steady, experienced airline pilot you’ve ever seen stride confidently into the cockpit. He did his homework, unlike some candidates. He knew the exchanges weren’t about him.

Pence knew how to deftly deflect each one and pivot to sharp, concise Trump campaign points he knows well without notes. Pence knew what he wanted to get out. And he did. So, it was Kaine wasting his time desperately interrupting more than five dozen times.

Trump watched that debate. He graciously tweeted during it. He said it made him proud that he picked Pence as partner. Clearly, the TV showman learned his lesson. This time he left the campaign trail for two full days of debate prep.

And it showed last night in Trump’s relentless presentation of why he’s the man to change what everyone is so blessedly sick of in Washington—and why Hillary Clinton and wandering hubby Bill is just more of the same old same old that’s abused our trust for 30 years.

That’s the sort of thing you might read Monday morning. If you don’t, then save your betting money on the final debate in Las Vegas Oct. 19. It won’t matter."

Makes sense.

The guy was accused of rape and we know he cheated on Hillary many, many times.

Looks like some other people had the same idea.

Check out what happened on the today show. Nice.

Love me some Rick Astley too. The media is busy talking about Donald Trump saying bad words and being rude 10 years before he ran for president but yet lying to the American people about your government emails and being accused of rape is apparently not as important.

Priorities. It is starting to look like there is a real shot that Donald brings up Bill’s past in this next debate.

If Hillary brings up this audio of Trump that was leaked today is there any way he could resist?

It’ll be fun to watch."

Donald Trump’s son Eric may have played a part.

Eric called the move ‘evil and sick.’

From Breitbart:

In an interview with Ohio talk show host Bob Frantz, the GOP nominee’s son slammed Hillary for the pending $63,000 ad buy calling her a “typical politician” for the cynical move.

“I’m a guy who, maybe in a certain crazy way, believes in karma,” Trump said of Hillary’s plan to air the ads. “There’s something pretty evil and sick about that if you ask me.” In the end, before the business day was up, team Clinton pulled back on its plans and decided to wait until the storms were over to launch the advertisements, Fox News reported. More from Fox News:

“We have requested that stations in Florida delay any of those ads on the Weather Channel until after the storm passes,” spokesman Jesse Ferguson said in a statement Thursday.


…

Politico noted that Donald Trump and other candidates have advertised on the same channel this year. But the bid to capture support from anxious Florida residents in the path of a deadly storm that has triggered mass evacuation orders and is expected to strengthen soon into a destructive Category 4 created a bit of an optics problem.

“If they’re out being too political at a time when the country has its prayers with the people affected, I think it could backfire,” Rep. Greg Walden, chairman of the National Republican Congressional Committee, told Fox News earlier Thursday, before the delay was announced.

From a political standpoint, it seemed like a smart move by the Clinton team.

A lot of people were definitely tuning in to the Weather Channel to see what was going on.

From a moral standpoint, it seems pretty awful.

Forced to backtrack, the Hillary campaign continues to make themselves look like a laughingstock.

Never let a good tragedy go to waste, right? "

About time.

We’ve all been waiting to hear what she thinks.

Rather than noting that the 1995 returns were obtained illegally, Silverman wants her air-headed Twitter followers to think Trump was ‘stealing’ for nearly two decades by not paying federal taxes.

She refuses to mention that because Trump declared a loss of over $900 million in ’95 which legally allowed him to avoid paying the taxes.

Must’ve slipped her mind. From BizPac Review:

Comedian Sarah Silverman failed miserably at an attempt to slam Donald Trump on his taxes. In a post on Twitter, the foul-mouthed entertainer accused Trump of “stealing” by using legal deductions in his taxes. Reactions from people who actually follow the news…

 Oh, that’s right.

Hillary did the same exact thing.

Did grandma steal too, Sarah?

100403,1008,"Hillary, Kaine, and Creepy Clowns",http://www.americanthinker.com/articles/2016/10/hillary_kaine_and_creepy_clowns.html,15,"At Tuesday night’s debate we were treated to Tim Kaine’s fidgets, twitches, squirms, and water sipping. He did all of that more often than interrupt Mike Pence with slanders. He looked off-kilter. There was, well, something faintly creepy about Kaine, confirmed when he had no good retort to Pence’s outing of Hillary’s and his pro-partial birth abortion stand. Something creepy, particularly -- and morally appalling -- about taking a baby’s life near birth. Creepy that Kaine claims Catholicism as his faith -- Catholicism, which sees abortion as an intrinsic sin.

Then there’s Hillary, who’s creeped us out for decades. The cold, dark, withering stares. The explosive, cackling laughs. There’s the video for a union audience where Hillary spouts in a weird bobble-headed way about why she’s not leading Donald Trump by 50 points. Here’s a woman who looks like she’s wound tighter than a drum, only to pop up at the most inappropriate times like a creepy jack-in-the-box, waggling and grimacing enough to give kids nightmares.

Lately, creepy clowns have been showing up in the East and South, mostly. Clowns standing under streetlights late nights, staring at lone passing motorists. Or lurking at the edge of woods. Unnerving, if not downright scary.

Entering the world of Hillary, Bill, Tim, the left, and the Democratic Party nowadays is on par with entering a Halloween scare house. It’s an upside-down affair of chilling stuff. But the scares aren’t for fun. The scares come with consequences, which can be detrimental to U.S. interests and American lives, abroad and at home. 



The Middle East is in ruins, thanks to the handiwork of Barack and Hillary (honorable mention, John Kerry). Syria is a hellhole. Due to the vacuum left by the president in Syria, Putin has staked a big claim. Libya’s a mess. The U.S. has lost valuable ground gained by American blood in Afghanistan and Iraq. An appeasement deal gives the Iranians safe passage toward nuclear weapons, which will one day menace not just Israel and U.S. allied Arab states, but Europe and, in time, with ballistic missiles or other means of delivery, America. An arms race has started in the Middle East and that makes a dangerous neighborhood increasingly so.  

ISIS has risen up and been emboldened by the Obama-Hillary-Kerry axis. Promising a global caliphate built on the bodies of us infidels, ISIS and like forces slaughter Christians and “apostate” Muslims. But we’re told dismissively by Obama that ISIS is just a collection of misfits and thugs that, sooner or later, will be brushed away.

ISIS oppresses, abuses, and sometimes kills its own women, gays, and children. Its irregulars are routinely committing acts of terror in Western Europe and the U.S., with much more death and carnage in store -- if not countered quickly enough. 

But where’s the thumping condemnation by Hillary and Kaine of ISIS as a Muslim-inspired politico-religious movement? They won’t even acknowledge that the terror is Muslim-inspired (or do so only grudgingly when pressed). Doing so is verboten in the crazy world of liberaldom. When do these compassionate liberals stand tall to chastise Islam in general for said oppressions and abuses of women, gays, and children, populations Hillary and Kaine swear they exist to protect? Maybe the pledge to protect the vulnerable is all feel-good and rationalizes bigger government that benefits Hill’s and Tim’s cronies and supporting constituencies?

When the debate topic of permitting Syrian refugees into the U.S. came up, Kaine spoke inanely. U.S. security agencies fret -- with good cause -- that among this refugee mass will be ISIS agents and irregulars (aka, terrorists), who aren’t coming for fresh starts in the New World.

In accommodating these Syrians (few Christians among them), Kaine sputtered that “constitutional rights” take precedent. If so, they do so over the welfare and safety of us citizens. Imagine that, infers Kaine for Hillary, ours is a constitution that fails to have as its paramount responsibility the protection of the homeland and its citizens. Which Founding Father rolls over first in his grave?


Imagine this: President Hillary and Vice President Kaine visiting the families of innocents slaughtered at a mall food court by a “rogue” refugee to explain how noble the sacrifice: their loved ones died for a perverted interpretation of constitutional rights.

Imagine the pained expressions on Hillary’s and Tim’s faces as they emerge from meetings with aggrieved families. Before rows of cameras and mikes, the president and her “right-hand person” offer reassurances. This dastardly act of, well, not terrorism but murder will not be allowed to stand. The perpetrator blew himself sky-high to make the slaughter possible, but the “coconspirators” (if any; the killer may have been just a humanphobe) will be brought to justice -- tracked down, arrested, lawyered up, and tried. If found guilty, parole is only a maybe.

Scary stuff, but not the last. And there seems no exit out.

Scary that Hillary maintained a private email server while Secretary of State that contained highly classified national security information, guaranteed to have been mined by our nation’s enemies. How greatly at risk are we thanks to all the compromised classified information? How susceptible to blackmail would a President Hillary be? And for more than national security breaches, but Clinton Foundation emails?   

How scary is it to you that the FBI director, James Comey, was either pressured into a cover-up of Hillary’s criminality or simply, frighteningly, complicit?

Scary that to Hillary, Kaine, and Democrats -- or any globalist -- that our borders are no longer inviolate. Our borders are hindrances to the movement of cheap labor and new constituencies for Democrats to harvest. Scary that tuberculosis is seen again in our nation among illegals -- TB and other illnesses not known previously to our country are here.    

Scary that after nearly eight years of Barack Obama, millions of American are un- or underemployed. Economic growth is anemic. Wages are practically stagnant. Working class Americans struggle and suffer greatly to make ends meet. The coal industry is being virtually shut down. Scary that the mainstream media acts as propagandists to hide the truth. Scarier that Hillary and Kaine are promising to double down on Obama’s failed economic policies.

Scary that Bill’s bride and her Democrats, in a blatant pander to Black Lives Matter, indiscriminately indict police in communities across the land, stating that cops, regardless of race or color, are latent racists. Scary that diminished and hamstrung by Democrats and the left, the men and women who make up our police forces are put at greater risk, not to mention our communities. The creepy and dangerous among us are surely less fearful of the police, and much less inhibited. Why won’t the oppression of the police result in more crime and suffering by innocents, in at-risk poor communities, especially? 

There’s much, much more, but enough.

Creepy clowns loitering under streetlights or lurking near woods… worry less about them than those heading the Democratic ticket.

100404,1008,Boycott Leftism,http://www.americanthinker.com/articles/2016/10/boycott_leftism.html,15,"The Achilles heel of leftism is its dependence upon conservatives and other normal people using the institutions of society that leftism has invested, and so providing the audience and income needed for the left to use against us.  These institutions conspire against the normal operations of the marketplace by declining to ever compete by offering an alternative to leftism.

What this means in practice is that the networks, at least until Fox News, never, ever exposed the bias and the lies of competing networks when those biases and lies were part of an ideological message.  What this means is that no academic institution exposes the totalitarian leftism of notionally ""competing"" institutions.  What this means is that the insidious infiltration by the left into institutions of public life once truly neutral over time transforms these institutions into more robotic soldiers of the left.

Football is an excellent example of how this works.  College athletic departments, which once did not care a hoot about political correctness, now have either cadres of the left as their spokesmen or have utterly cowed and terrified administrators who dare not say a word against the messages of the left.

The college football players who enter the NFL find the same insinuation of leftist cant into every crevice of professional football.  Although the dopey former San Francisco 49ers' insulting behavior during the National Anthem is a conspicuous example of leftist venom, the cringing fear of offending the left seems to terrify everyone in football.

Well, let football be terrified instead of offending those Americans who watch football on television and pay for tickets to football games and buy sporting equipment endorsed by football players.  There is evidence that this is happening.  As Rick Moran noted in American Thinker on October 5, Monday Night Football ratings have dropped 19% this year.  The same day, Rasmussen reported that a whopping 32% of Americans said they are less likely to watch NFL games because of the offensive Black Lives Matter glop.

What conservatives and other normal people have done to punish the NFL, they have done as well to punish those corporations that beg for their business but then reflexively follow political correctness in slapping down conservatives in other areas.

Cracker Barrel learned in just a few hours how deeply its customers were offended by corporate condemnation of Duck Dynasty and quickly issued a mea culpa before the losses in sales got too high or the perception that Cracker Barrel corporate bureaucrats really looked down on its customers got too focused.

Walmart, another business that would quickly go belly-up if conservatives stopped shopping there, also moved fast to change a decision not to bake a cake for a paying customer with ""Blue Lives Matter"" because that was deemed ""racist.""

If corporate offices learned that offending conservatives, Christians, patriotic Americans, and other groups seen as fair game today produced a permanent loss of consumer goodwill and sales, then corporate employees from CEOs down to store managers would be trained not to offend those who buy the stuff that pays their salaries.

What if conservative groups united to organize boycotts of all corporations who outrageously offend their values or use corporate funds to advance a radical agenda?  Competitors would see the market advantage in not offending conservatives, which would begin to change corporate behavior.

The more pervasive this insistence to treat conservatives and their values fairly, the weaker the left would become.  This ought to extend to every part of public life, including those areas of government activity that rely upon consumers. 

What if college enrollment at state universities dropped 15% in one year, with those conservatives who have been paying the tuition announcing that this would continue until intolerant and bullying leftism was purged from academia?  What if, at the same time, conservative groups at the state government level demanded a reduction in spending for higher education until state schools undertook an affirmative action program to bring conservatives into tenured positions and created protections for conservative students in classrooms?

If conservatives boycotted leftism whenever it appeared as an intolerant and thuggish presence in public life, then conservatives, a majority of Americans and by far the largest ideological group in the country, would begin to win the battles that really matter – the battles that the left, through its guerrilla forces, has been quietly and slowly winning for decades. 

This is a war that can be waged by conservatives in a thousand little battles every day against the leftist establishment, imperialist occupiers of our land, and it is a war that can be surely and decisively won.

100405,1008,Political Correctness Is Still No Laughing Matter,http://www.americanthinker.com/articles/2016/10/political_correctness_is_still_no_laughing_matter.html,15,"Political correctness isn't just about changing the nursery rhyme 'Baa Baa Black Sheep' to 'Baa Baa Rainbow Sheep'; or changing the word 'history' to 'herstory'. It's also about “affirmative action”, revising curricula (i.e. “canon busting”), police actions and sometimes imprisonments, “no whites allowed” university meetings, censorship, numerous bannings, the “no platform” policy, professors losing their tenure, and so on. (Now add two new kids on the block, 'safe spaces' and 'cultural appropriation'.) In other words, PC has gone way beyond simply changing the words we use.

George W. Bush neatly expressed both the pros and cons of political correctness when, in a 1991 speech, he said that ""[t]he notion of political correctness has ignited controversy across the land”. Bush went on to say that “although the movement arises from the laudable desire to sweep away the debris of racism and sexism and hatred, it replaces old prejudice with new ones”. He finished off by saying that PC “declares certain topics off-limits, certain expressions off-limits, even certain gestures off-limits”.

So Bush (above) said that the PC “movement arises from the laudable desire to sweep away the debris of racism and sexism and hatred”. And, of course, it's laudable to want to get rid of racism, sexism, etc. Yet it all depends on how these isms are taken. It also depends, in a sense, on where they're taken. The problem with PC is that it's often too extreme, pious and pure. In other words, the things which the vast majority of people don't see as racist/sexist/etc. are seen that way by the High Priests of Political Correctness. Accusations of, say, racism or fascism are simply used as very effective political power-tools to destroy one's detractors.

Thus political correctness is a serious problem. It sustains an overwhelming and omnipresent hegemony of Leftist political/social power and it has done so for at least three decades. So much so that Paul Weyrich (the President of the Free Congress Foundation) claimed that “today, if you say the 'wrong thing', you suddenly have legal problems, political problems, you might even lose your job or be expelled from college”. What's more:

“Certain topics are forbidden. You can't approach the truth about a lot of different subjects. If you do, you are immediately branded as 'racist', 'sexist', 'homophobic', 'intensive', or 'judgemental'.”

I say 'hegemony' because political correctness, according to Anthony Browne, occurs “[i]n workplaces across the country, from companies to army bases, from hospitals to TV stations”. More particularly, “people are being subjected to 'diversity training' to re-educate them and make them more politically correct”.

Peter Coleman (a former government minister in Australia) got to the heart of the political nature of political correctness when he wrote the following:

“Its first and pre-eminent characteristic is that it calls for the politicisation -- one might say the transformation -- of life. It wants political direction of all departments from, say, children's fiction to judicial judgements. No profession is exempt. All must meet a political test -- of correct thinking and progress. Lawyers, accountants, doctors, scientists, novelists, journalists and businessmen must all pass it.”

And the most powerful way of changing the way we think is to legislate/act on the words we use.

Controlling Words to Control Thoughts

The putative political and social consequences of politically-incorrect words (therefore politically-incorrect thoughts) are made clear by academics Jessica Pinta and Joy Yakubu. They tell us that ""linguistic constructs influence our way of thinking negatively, peaceful coexistence is threatened and social stability is jeopardized”. These examples are all ""the effect of politically incorrect use of language"". What's more, politically-incorrect words are said to result in a ""climate of repression"".

So what's to be done about all this?

Firstly, Jessica Pinta and Joy Yakubu believe that “the imposition of a moral agenda on a community is justified"". PC also ""requires less emphasis on individual rights and more on assuring 'historically oppressed' persons the means of achieving equal rights”.

Thus PC-ers don't just want to be in control of the words we use, they also want to control our thoughts. After all, if the words change, though the thoughts 'underneath' them remain the same, then the PC policy of word-control loses its purpose.

Don't take my word for any of this, take the words of Professor Edna Andrews.

In the article 'Cultural Sensitivity and Political Correctness: The Linguistic Problem of Naming' (1996), Professor Edna Andrews says that ""language represents thought, and may even control thought"". Philosophically this is largely correct on two fronts. One, language is a determinant of thought and even of consciousness itself. Two, political correctness would serve little purpose if, after changing ours words, people still subvocalised (or carried out internal dialogues) with words which remained sinfully politically incorrect.

This way of thinking was originally based on, amongst other things, the Sapir-Whorf Hypothesis, which argued that language -- or even grammar itself -- determines the way we see the world. Thus the language-to-thought (rather than thought-to-language) idea was given a political spin; if not by Sapir and Whorf themselves, then by those who accepted their hypothesis.

Edna Andrews is explicit about the language-to-thought idea being a political tool when she states that it's a ""reasonable deduction... [to accept] cultural change via linguistic change"". Thus changing our words is but a means to changing both what we think and, subsequently, what we do.

Defenders of PC

The well-known British journalist Polly Toynbee said that ""the phrase [politically correct] is an empty, right-wing smear, designed only to elevate its user"". It can hardly be said to be “empty”. It may well be, at times, a “disguise for racism” or intrinsically right-wing/conservative views; though having a (big) problem with political correctness is hardly an “empty” stance.

What Toynbee is doing here is tapping into view (held by political-correctors) that those who commit politically-incorrect sins are not only wrong, they are also evil/bad. The Wall Street Journal expressed (31st December, 1993) this perfectly in the following statement:

“Political correctness, for all its awfulness, is an effort to save souls through language.”

Toynbee refuses to make any distinctions between puritanical and extreme political correctness and the type of political correctness that people often make jokes about.

When Toynbee goes on to say that people who criticise the words “political correctness” are people “who still want to say Paki, spastic, or queer”. As a typical left-winger, Toynbee has a strong dislike of the majority of people who have a problem with political correctness. (Or at least with extreme and puritanical political correctness.) The thing is, even in the 1970s many people had a problem with some politically-incorrect words -- long before political correctness had gained total control. Again, it's extreme and puritanical political correctness that's the problem; along with the political-correctors never-ending desire to fundamentally change all aspects of society (from head to toe).

What else would explain the following vicious tirade from Yasmin Alibhai-Brown (a British Muslim journalist and anti-white racist). These words are aimed at a critic of political correctness:

“Here, in his own words, are the fearful fantasies of an anti-PC chap gone quite mad, but who is nevertheless taken as a brave prophet by other paranoids.”

She then states his positions on various subjects and, well, that's it! It's as if the very stating of negative facts or truths about political correctness is enough to render the speaker morally evil -- at least according to Alibhai-Brown's Islington Set.

Context

The economist and Labourite Will Hutton was a little more subtle (than Alibhai-Brown) when he wrote the following:

“Political correctness is one of the brilliant tools that the American Right developed in the mid-1980s, as part of its demolition of American liberalism.... What the sharpest thinkers on the American Right saw quickly was that by declaring war on the cultural manifestations of liberalism -- by levelling the charge of 'political correctness' against its exponents -- they could discredit the whole political project.”

Will Hutton is factually incorrect on one thing. It wasn't the “American Right” that coined and “developed” the words/concept political correctness: it was originally an ironic self-description used by “American liberals” in order to stop them getting too pious or extreme about what is and what isn't, well, politically correct.

Finally, yes, it would indeed be a good thing to “discredit the whole political project” of political correctness; if not also to, as Will Hutton puts it, discredit “American liberalism” itself.

100406,1009,HILLARY SPEECH EXCERPTS LEAKED: SHE WANTS “OPEN BORDERS”,http://www.powerlineblog.com/archives/2016/10/hillary-speech-excerpts-leaked-she-wants-open-borders.php,15,"Wikileaks has finally released some of the anti-Hillary Clinton material it has been promising, in the form of emails from the account of campaign chairman John Podesta. I haven’t had time to read many of them, but Drudge highlighted an email from campaign research director Tony Carrk that quoted potentially damaging excerpts from Hillary’s speeches to Goldman Sachs and the like.

To me, the most striking thing about the speech excerpts is how pedestrian they are. Like the speech I panned here, these excerpts contain no spark of originality or intelligence. If she was really getting paid $300,000 for this mush, it was highway robbery.

I don’t think there is much here for the Trump campaign to work with, with one possible exception. It comes from a speech to a Brazilian bank:

My dream is a hemispheric common market, with open trade and open borders, some time in the future with energy that is as green and sustainable as we can get it, powering growth and opportunity for every person in the hemisphere.

We don’t see any surrounding text, so I don’t know whether Hillary elaborated on what she meant by “open borders,” or whether she expounded further on immigration policy. But “open borders” is a pretty well recognized term of art. It means what it sounds like–no restrictions on immigration; in effect, no borders. Sort of a John Lennon fantasy–“Imagine there’s no countries.” If Hillary really believes in open borders, there is no way she can or should be president, but I have lost all hope of the Trump campaign being able to make a coherent point, even on Trump’s once-favorite issue of immigration."
100407,1009,HUMA ABEDIN ATTACKED MAINSTREAM JEWISH GROUP,http://www.powerlineblog.com/archives/2016/10/huma-abedin-attacked-mainstream-jewish-group.php,15,"Huma Abedin, Hillary Clinton’s increasingly notorious confidante and top aide, urged Bill Clinton to reject an invitation to speak before the American Israel Public Affairs Council (AIPAC). In an email, she wrote: “u really want to consider sending him into that crowd?” (Emphasis added)

From her use of the phrase “that crowd,” you might think that AIPAC is a radical organization that advocates ethnic cleansing or some other draconian “solution” to the problems of the Middle East. In reality, of course, AIPAC, is as mainstream a Jewish political organization as exists.

“That crowd” consists of American Jews of all political persuasions. “That crowd” routinely gives standing ovations to speakers from the Obama administrations, whose prescriptions for the Middle East, formulated by President Obama and Clinton herself, hardly tilt against the Palestinians.

To refer to attendees of AIPAC meeting as “that crowd” confirms the depth of Abedin’s anti-Israeli bias.

That bias has long been suspected. Abedin was raised in Saudi Arabia by a family with ties to the Muslim Brotherhood. As Richard Pollock reminds us, her parents ran the Journal of Muslim Minority Affairs.

Mr. Abdein’s benefactor was Abdullah Omar Naseef, secretary general of the Muslim World League (MWL). The U.S. Department of the Treasury designated Rabita Trust, a subsidiary of the MWL, as a terrorist entity. Osama bin Laden credited MWL as a funding source after the 9/11 attacks.

When Abedin was at the State Department, I tended not to view her potential to influence U.S. policy towards Israel with as much alarm as some did. Given what I’ve since learned about Abedin’s extraordinary relationship with Hillary Clinton and what we now know about her contempt for AIPAC, I tend to view her potential to influence U.S. policy towards Israel in a Clinton administration with panic.

I wonder, though, how much influencing would be required of Abedin. Hillary Clinton is no friend of Israel, in my view.

Arguably, U.S. policy has never been more hostile towards Israel than during President Obama’s first term, when Clinton was Secretary of State. And I’ve never been able to forget Hillary’s get together with Suha Arafat in the late 1990s. It included a shopping trip, a kiss, and the refusal of Clinton to counter Mrs. Arafat’s claim, made in Hillary’s presence, that Israel was using poison gas to pollute the West Bank’s water and land.

Hillary kissing Suha Arafat, who accused Israel of genocide in her presence, and chewing out Bibi Netanyahu for 45 minutes would be cause for concern even if Huma Abedin had never met Mrs. Clinton. But with Abedin at her side, the concern must be all the more pronounced."

Hillary Clinton has opened up a meaningful lead in almost every national poll, as undecided voters appear to be breaking her way. This is how the polls look today at Real Clear Politics; click to enlarge: Trump’s standing reflects not just his debate performance, but also his post-debate behavior. Trump has suffered two periods when he took a hit in the polls. The first was after the Democratic convention, when he engaged in a four-day battle with the family of a soldier who was killed in Iraq. The second follows the first debate, when Trump absurdly feuded with former Miss Universe Alicia Machado, who now becomes a footnote to history. One could say that Trump is a slow learner.

Our foreign policy is a bad joke, we are $20 trillion in debt, Obamacare is collapsing, our economy is stagnant, and the Democrats have nominated their worst candidate in living memory. Inconceivable as it seemed to me a few months ago, it now appears that the Democrats have a good chance of hanging on to the White House for another four years."

Mike Pence confirmed the ticket’s position in an interview with Dr. James Dobson that will air next Wednesday. The Christian Post, an anti-LGBT publication, reported on the interview after obtaining an audio file in advance.
According to CP, Pence explains that both he and Donald Trump believe that concerns about which bathrooms transgender students should use can be “resolved” at the local level. He added that children’s “safety” and “privacy” should be priorities in these decisions_—_dogwhistle terms referring to the myth that trans students are somehow a threat to other students and should be kept out of restrooms that match their gender identity.
“Washington has no business intruding on the operation of our local schools,” Pence insists.
Pence also confirmed that a President Trump would either eliminate the contraceptive mandate in Obamacare or provide a religious exemption for all ministries and businesses. “The Trump/Pence administration will be dedicated to preserving the liberties of our people, including the freedom of religion that’s enshrined in our Bill of Rights.” This is the latest evidence that Trump, despite his claims of being LGBT-friendly, will cater to social conservatives’ anti-LGBT demands. Over the course of his campaign, he has taken just about every anti-LGBT position he can. He has promised to appoint Supreme Court justices who would overturn marriage equality, he’s backslid on protecting trans people from discrimination, and he has also said he would sign the First Amendment Defense Act, a federal bill that would legalize various forms of anti-LGBT discrimination. Trump’s only offering to the LGBT community_—_granting the premise_—_has been a post-Orlando homonationalist promise to defeat “radical Islam.”
LGBT activists have argued that Trump’s selection of Pence as his running mate was also a huge overture to the religious right, given his extreme anti-LGBT record. Pence’s interview with Dobson, the founder of some of the biggest anti-LGBT organizations in the country (Focus on the Family and the Family Research Council), about all the anti-LGBT actions a Trump/Pence administration would take is the ultimate confirmation that he’s part of an anti-LGBT ticket."

Since Lucero’s death, local leaders have worked tirelessly to educate the community, reform and diversify the local police force, and make Suffolk County more welcoming to immigrants and refugees.
All that changed this year when Donald Trump rose to prominence on the political landscape. Immigrants and local leaders on Long Island told ThinkProgress that they see a rise in anti-immigrant anger spurred by Trump’s proposals for mass deportations and a border wall, and speeches demonizing immigrants. They worry violence could follow.
“We’re afraid of going back to those dark days” that lead up to Lucero’s killing, said Maryann Slutsky, Executive Director of the immigration-focused organization Long Island WINS. “We’ve made so much progress and now we’re going to go right back to where we started from.”
A fertile ground for violence
Long before Donald Trump launched his presidential campaign with a notorious speech calling Latin American immigrants criminals, drug dealers, and rapists, Long Island had developed its own reputation for anti-immigrant hostility.
“Latino immigrants in Suffolk County are regularly harassed, taunted, and pelted with objects hurled from cars,” a Southern Poverty Law Center report found in 2009. “They are frequently run off the road while riding bicycles, and many report being beaten with baseball bats and other objects. Others have been shot with BB guns or pepper-sprayed. Most will not walk alone after dark; parents often refuse to let their children play outside. A few have been the targets of arson attacks and worse.”
The SPLC and residents who spoke to ThinkProgress about the tensions that preceded Lucero’s death placed some of the blame for this environment on local politicians, who over the past few decades have attempted to pass immigrant-targeting legislation and openly called for violence.
At a public hearing in 2001, County Legislator Michael D’Andre of Smithtown said that if the number of Latino day laborers increased in his community, “We’ll be out with baseball bats.”
In 2007, County Legislator Elie Mystal of Amityville said of Latino day laborers, “If I’m living in a neighborhood and people are gathering like that, I would load my gun and start shooting, period.”
In 2009, Long Island’s Oyster Bay passed a law criminalizing day laborers. “Their need to be employed doesn’t mean they can cause chaos on our streets,” said Town Supervisor John Venditto. A federal court struck down the law as unconstitutional last year.
In 2015, Riverhead town Councilwoman Jodi Giglio pushed for a policy to profile, fingerprint, and detain suspected undocumented immigrants, saying: “We can’t just keep releasing criminals out onto the street. This could be our next Freedom Tower attack.”
In 2006, Suffolk County Executive Steve Levy spoke of women crossing the border to give birth to “anchor babies… free of charge.” He unsuccessfully pushed for a law that would have empowered county police officers to detain Latinos solely on suspicion of being undocumented and turn them over to federal authorities for deportation. In 2008, he dismissed Marcelo Lucero’s murder as a “one-day story.”
Joselo Lucero, Marcelo’s younger brother, told ThinkProgress he believes Levy is partly responsible for stirring up the hatred that led to his brother’s death, and he fears Donald Trump could have a similar impact with his own anti-immigrant message.
“Levy had so much influence in the local media, which gave him the space to talk about implementing all these rules against immigrants,” he said. “If a local politician in one small town can lead to the murder of my brother, imagine what someone at a high level could do.”
When contacted by ThinkProgress, Levy pushed back hard against this characterization. “How can anyone say that the teenage thugs, who never even knew my name or anything about county government, were somehow taking their cues from those in leadership positions?” he said. “These were simply thugs who committed outrageous crimes and were punished accordingly.”
Levy claimed that until Marcelo Lucero’s murder, “not a single elected official”— himself included— was aware of “heinous activity” being perpetrated against immigrants in the area. He took umbrage at being “excoriated” by “extremists” for pursuing strict immigration enforcement policies.
“Our emergency rooms were being flooded,” he said. “There were tremendous costs having to be borne by taxpayers to deal with the influx of illegal immigrants into our school system. There was a great deal of housing overcrowding, and in some cases, up to 200 laborers congregating at 7-Elevens or on busy street corners, creating very difficult traffic situations.” While Central Americans have been migrating to Long Island for several decades and have been a part of the community for multiple generations, a recent influx of refugees from the region exacerbated existing anti-immigrant sentiment. As tens of thousands of children from Central America have entered the United States over the past couple years_—_many of them fleeing brutal gang violence in their home countries_—_Suffolk County became one of the top receiving communities in the nation. Hundreds of kids have been released to relatives already living on Long Island while they await their day in court.
Many community members have been vocally opposed to taking these children in. At a community forum earlier this year, residents suggested the children could carry Ebola or other diseases, be members of gangs, or bring drugs into the country.
“You have where immigrants live, and you have where non-immigrants live, and never the twain shall meet.”
“These little kids risked their lives to come here because life was so impossible and horrific and violent in their home countries,” said Slutsky. “They were just coming to be with their parents. But people here were demonizing them and saying the stupidest things, like that they would bring their property values down.”
Another factor fueling a fear of immigrants, said local immigration attorney Elise Damas, is Long Island’s extreme economic and racial segregation. “You have very few communities where there is intermixing,” she said. “You have where immigrants live, and you have where non-immigrants live, and never the twain shall meet. The extent of interaction with immigrants for most Long Islanders is the guy who mows their lawn.”
Damas, who works with the Central American human rights group CARECEN, is among the advocates who say those who do not personally know immigrants are more susceptible to negative rhetoric about them from local officials and from Donald Trump.
“When he says these awful things, it makes an impression on people who don’t know any differently,” Slutsky said. “So I don’t fault people who don’t know. If I didn’t do this work all day, I wouldn’t know that immigrants pay taxes and sustain the community economically. But because many people don’t know, his words really matter.”
Reckoning
Marcelo Lucero’s death was a reckoning for Long Island.
As the teens who murdered him stood trial, an investigation by the Justice Department found widespread discrimination against Latinos by the Suffolk County Police Department, which regularly failed to investigate hate crimes and discouraged Latino residents from reporting those crimes in the first place. The DOJ ordered a series of reforms, including the hiring of bilingual officers, better training, and the reprimand of officers who discriminated. A report last year found that the department is complying with some, but not all, of these reforms.
As civil rights groups pushed for the police department to fully implement the federally mandated changes and improve relations with the immigrant community, people directly impacted by the violent climate, including Joselo Lucero, began to speak out. He joined the Hagedorn Foundation, a Long Island-based nonprofit that works with groups on social justice issues. He regularly visits local universities, high schools, and teachers’ conferences to talk about bullying, discrimination, and hate crimes, and he also appears on local radio shows and writes op-eds for local newspapers to promote his message of tolerance and understanding.
“If we don’t constantly remind people what happened, they’re going to forget, and things will go back to the way they were before,” he warned.
The Hagedorn Foundation also began taking community members on annual delegations to Mexico to help them understand the economic, political, and social factors that force so many people to migrate to the United States in the first place.
Drama teacher Ruthie Pincus, who teaches at a high school just a few minutes away from where Marcelo Lucero died, went on one of these delegations this summer.
“I really did not know much about immigration or what has been going on Mexico,” she said. “The trip made me very sensitive to the idea that people may not necessarily choose to leave their families behind and make such a difficult journey. They sometimes have no choice. I also had to look at my own privilege and understand that not everyone has what we have.”
“People may not necessarily choose to leave their families behind and make such a difficult journey. They sometimes have no choice.”
Pincus says she now shares what she has learned with her students at Hauppauge High School “almost every day,” and says they “are opening their ears and eyes and beginning to understand.”
With changes taking shape on both the institutional and community levels, residents began to hope that Long Island could become a place that welcomed immigrants rather than feared them. But they say the atmosphere took a sharp turn this year, when Donald Trump launched his bid for the White House on a platform of banning some immigrants and deporting millions of others.
“This election is creating a culture that’s terrifying,” Pincus said. “But it gives me all that more drive to speak about what I’ve seen and about the humanity of immigrants.”
Suffolk County gets trumped
This April, Donald Trump held a rally just a few blocks from the site where Marcelo Lucero was killed. As the hotel mogul and GOP nominee read a poem comparing immigrants to dangerous serpents, physical fights broke out inside, and two attendees were arrested. A few weeks later, members of the community woke up to find recruitment flyers from the Ku Klux Klan scattered on the streets. The materials declared “White Lives Do Matter” and warned of a “cultural genocide” if immigration is allowed to continue.
The notorious white supremacist group has leafleted on Long Island several times over the past few years, predating Trump’s White House bid. But Joselo Lucero sees a connection between Trump’s rhetoric and a revival of overt racism in the community.
“When you have somebody running for the presidency using this type of language, it can influence people to be more against minorities and immigrants,” he told ThinkProgress.
Patchogue Mayor Paul Pontieri agrees. After learning of the KKK fliers, he told a local newspaper that “the rhetoric we hear continually from our almost-elected officials, whether it’s building walls or banning Muslims, it really gives people cover to do these kinds of things.” Other Long Islanders report troubling signs of Trump’s influence in the area.
“There has been some deterioration this year,” said Pat Young, a professor at Long Island’s Hofstra University. “I see Latinos walking along and people scream at them, ‘Build the wall!’ It’s said to intimidate them.” Young said the slogan about a U.S.-Mexico border wall_—_a central theme of Trump’s campaign_—_has “become shorthand for ‘We don’t like Latinos.’”
Salvadoran immigrant Yancy Rivera, who has lived in the town of Hicksville on Long Island for 13 years, says she began seeing homemade signs with anti-immigrant messages after Trump’s campaign stop this spring.
“People started putting up signs on their lawns that basically said, ‘Latinos shouldn’t be in this country. They should get out,’” she said. “That didn’t feel good at all. I have family here. I can’t bring my children back to a country they don’t know.”
“He says openly on TV that immigrants are bad, and people follow whatever he says.”
Even local Republicans attribute some of the anti-immigrant fervor to the GOP nominee. Henry Salgado, who works on community relations for the Nassau County GOP, says that kind of rhetoric can be influential.
“He says openly on TV that immigrants are bad, and people follow whatever he says,” Salgado noted. “He’s spreading very bad rumors against immigrants, and there are people out there who are prejudiced who are listening.”
People on Long Island are certainly listening. In the primary election this spring, Trump won more votes in Suffolk County than anywhere else in New York. Far more Republican primary votes were cast in the county than Democratic votes, despite the fact that the county has backed a Democrat for president in every election since 1992.
Other parts of the United States have already seen Trump supporters physically attacking immigrants or those perceived to be immigrants. Long Islanders fear their community, with its fraught history, could be next.
“If you’re an average citizen and you’re looking at somebody constantly saying, ‘We’re being invaded. These people are coming and taking over,’ it creates a mentality where people say, ‘We have to do something about this,’” Joselo Lucero said. “Crimes against immigrants could happen at any time. I hope it’s not going to escalate.”
Long Islanders push back
When Donald Trump and Hillary Clinton faced off on the debate stage at Long Island’s Hofstra University in early October, hundreds of students and community members flooded the campus to wave signs, shout slogans, and denounce Trump’s rhetoric on crime, race, and immigration. Among them was sophomore Sharon Rus, who held aloft a neon sign reading “NO WALL.”
“Everyone should be able to be a part of America, not just people who look a certain way or have a certain skin color,” said Rus, a member of the Hofstra Feminist Collective. “We don’t want to be separationist, like some candidates. I want to show that Hofstra is about love and peace and not intolerance.” Rus and students like her show the views of native Long Islanders about immigration are changing, but the most sweeping changes have come from the Latino population, which is much more vocal and politically active than they were eight years ago.
Today, Latino community members testify at town council meetings, canvas door to door on local issues, and take to the streets to protest government policies. Record numbers of immigrants on Long Island are also becoming citizens and registering to vote, and organizers like Gabriela Castillo say this will ensure the community can “build electoral power and hold elected officials’ feet to the fire.”
“Nothing speaks louder than voting,” the native Long Islander said. “Latinos need to show our local elected officials that we’re informed, we’re involved, and we’re going to the polls on election day. That’s how we can hold them accountable.”
Since June, Castillo has worked with the Long Island Civic Engagement Table to register more than 5,000 new voters. They hope to knock on 20,000 doors over the next few weeks to make sure the community makes it to the polls. If Latinos turn out in big numbers, Castillo hopes, local officials will think twice before disparaging immigrants and pursuing harsh policies targeting immigrants.
“One sure way to get them to listen to us is to really show them the power of our vote and our activism,” she said."
100411,1010,Donald Trump’s unbelievable new statement about the Central Park 5,https://thinkprogress.org/donald-trumps-unbelievable-new-statement-about-the-central-park-5-5690ab3e9690#.t4vba8z10,15,"In 1990, a group of four black teens and one Latino teen were convicted of the brutal assault and rape of a jogger. The April 1989 attack came amid rising crime rates in New York City and a wave of violence in Central Park itself.
Despite the nonexistence of solid evidence, the five were convicted thanks to a confession they said was coerced by officers violently interrogating them while they were deprived of food and sleep. In 2002, their innocence was proven once and for all when another man confessed to the crime and his DNA was determined to match a sample found on the victim.
As ThinkProgress has previously documented, during the trial of the Central Park 5, Donald Trump called for capital punishment in an ad he spent more than $85,000 to place in four newspapers:

CREDIT: New York Times
Even after the five agreed to a $41 million settlement with the city in 2014, Trump continued to suggest they were less than innocent.
“My opinion on the settlement of the Central Park Jogger case is that it’s a disgrace,” Trump wrote in a June 2014 New York Daily News op-ed. “What about the other people who were brutalized that night, in addition to the jogger?”
In a tweet posted the year before, Trump alluded to the wave of crime Central Park was experiencing at the time of the attack to suggest that even if the teens weren’t guilty of rape, they were still guilty of something. Science ultimately confirmed the Central Park 5's innocence. The courts concluded they were wrongfully imprisoned. Yet Donald Trump, who has a notoriously fast and loose relationship with the truth, still won’t acknowledge it.
In a statement sent to CNN this week on the occasion of a retrospective about the case, Trump didn’t back away from his previous comments, but instead cited the false confession the teens made. “They admitted they were guilty,” he wrote.
“The police doing the original investigation say they were guilty. The fact that that case was settled with so much evidence against them is outrageous. And the woman, so badly injured, will never be the same,” he added. During his presidential run, Trump has embraced racial profiling and stop-and-frisk policies that have been shown to unconstitutionally impact people of color. But his statements about the Central Park 5 indicate the extent he’s willing to go to deny science and the rule of law to “make America safe again.” They also reflect his unwillingness to admit when he’s wrong_—_a trait that was also displayed when Trump continued to suggest President Obama isn’t an American citizen for years after the racially-changed conspiracy theory was debunked."
100412,1001,You think Mike Pence is any better? He's the top general in the Republican War on Women,http://www.dailykos.com/stories/2016/10/08/1579524/-You-think-Mike-Pence-is-any-better-He-s-the-top-general-in-the-Republican-War-on-Women#read-more,16,"Nauseous Republicans choking back their vomit are deep in the throes of a fever dream: Donald Trump drops out (he’s already said he won’t) and Mike Pence somehow replaces him (he can’t—the ballots are already printed). But this delusional fantasy demonstrates just how hollow the GOP’s supposed outrage over Trump’s “grab them by the pussy” remarks really is, because Pence isn’t just a run-of-the-mill conservative misogynist—he’s been a top general in the Republican War on Women for years.

In fact, Pence is the guy who literally invented the idea of defunding Planned Parenthood. He first introduced a bill designed to destroy the century-old women’s healthcare provider all the way back in 2007. During his time in Congress, in fact, he proposed such measures half a dozen times, until one finally passed in 2011. Here’s how he explained his loathing contempt for women at the time:

""If Planned Parenthood wants to be involved in providing counseling services and HIV testing, they ought not be in the business of providing abortions. As long as they aspire to do that, I’ll be after them.""
He’ll “be after them”—this organization that tries to provide life-saving services to under-served women. He doesn't give a holy fuck if his crusade deprives women of badly needed healthcare, and that’s not merely hypothetical. During his governorship, an HIV crisis exploded in Indiana after Planned Parenthood clinics were shuttered thanks to budget cuts instituted by Republicans—and Pence helped make it worse by refusing to take decisive action, leading to one of the worst HIV outbreaks in decades.

And that’s really it: Pence’s hatred runs so deep that he is content to let women die as a consequence of his jihad. But please don’t imagine for a moment that Pence’s animus toward women is confined to Planned Parenthood alone:

Earlier this year, Pence signed a law that would have required funerals be held for fetuses, whether for abortions or miscarriages, and no matter how far along the pregnancy was. (A judge blocked it from taking effect.)
Last year, he signed the so-called “Religious Freedom Restoration Act” that would have made it easier for Indiana businesses to discriminate against LGBT people, leading to a massive nationwide boycott of the state.
He supports using taxpayer funds for so-called “conversation therapy” to try to torture gay people into somehow becoming straight.
He refused to comply with a law passed by George W. Bush to reduce rape in prisons.
And he tried to prevent desperate Syrian refugees from settling in Indiana, earning a sharp rebuke from a federal court just days ago.
So how, exactly, is Mike Pence any better than Donald Trump? Sure, he might not openly discuss his predilection for assaulting women the way Trump does, but his policies are just as vengeful. And it’s no surprise that the same Republican Party that has declared open season on women has given rise to the likes of Trump. In fact, you could say that the hateful movement Pence has spearheaded for his entire political career is responsible for fathering Trump’s candidacy—and Republicans, of all people, should understand that things are too far along to terminate it."
100413,1001,Donald Trump's debate plan: Smear the Clintons to change the subject from his own vile record,http://www.dailykos.com/stories/2016/10/08/1579504/-Donald-Trump-s-debate-plan-Smear-the-Clintons-to-change-the-subject-from-his-own-vile-record,16,"With Donald Trump’s campaign in full-fledged meltdown, Trump’s plans for Sunday night’s debates appear to be coming together … and they’re no change from the Trump we’ve seen for the past 16 months. Trump previewed the plan in his “apology” Friday night:

I've said some foolish things, but there's a big difference between the words and actions of other people. Bill Clinton has actually abused women, and Hillary has bullied, attacked, shamed, and intimidated his victims. We will discuss this more in the coming days. See you at the debate on Sunday.
So that’s what it’ll be: attack the Clintons to distract from his own bragging about being a sexual predator. That idea doesn’t appear to have just been a cameo appearance in that “apology” video: Sunday night should be … interesting. It’s the kind of event where you’d normally say “brb, off to make popcorn,” but in this case it’s the popcorn of rage and depression that this is where we are in America in 2016.

As fast as Republicans are rushing to distance themselves from Trump now, he became their party’s nominee fair and square and they stuck with him through more than enough to know that this—the guy who brags about “grab[bing] them by the pussy” and then dismisses it as mere locker room banter—is who Donald Trump is. And now we’re faced with a presidential debate in which a major party’s presidential nominee is going to push back on his own recorded words by throwing around unsubstantiated allegations about his opponent’s husband. It’s our job not to let him change the subject. This is about who Donald Trump is, and no one can pretend not to know any longer."

Sure, Republicans were willing to put up with racism, sexism, religious bigotry, raiding a charity for fun and profit, attacking a Gold Star family, attacking women, attacking women, attacking more women. But Trump’s actually bragging about being a sexual predator seems to have finally been the last straw for a lot of Republicans who up to now were willing to say “Sure, he’s a racist pig who’s likely to start World War III, but he promises to cut my taxes.”

The list of people who were with Trump right up to the “grab” moment is still growing, and the real question now is how many of them aren’t just withdrawing endorsement, they’re indulging in the fantasy of pretending someone else can take the top chair. Then there’s the ones like Senator Kelly Ayotte, who are simply counting to ten in hopes Donald Trump goes away.

I will not be voting for Donald Trump or Hillary Clinton, and instead will be writing in Governor Pence on Election Day.
And then of course, there are the Republicans still wobbling because, hell, he’s still going to cut their taxes, right?

Oh, and a reminder: Trump isn't going anywhere.

But the nightmare is real: They’re stuck with a sex predator, and there’s nothing they can do about it. 
Calling for Trump to Withdraw

Idaho Senator Mike Crappo joined the crew calling on Trump to withdraw.

I urge Donald Trump to step aside and allow the Republican part to put forward a conservative candidate like Mike Pence who can defeat Hillary Clinton.
Alaska Senator Dan Sullivan is also on team Pence.

As for the White House, Donald Trump should step aside. I will support Mike Pence for President.
 South Dakota Governor Dennis Daugaard is another Pencer.

Enough is enough. Donald Trump should withdraw in favor of Governor Mike Pence. This election is too important.
As is businesswoman Carly Fiorina.

Today I ask Donald Trump to step aside and for the RNC to replace him with Gov. Mike Pence.
Out of all Trump’s primary opponents, Fiorina may be feeling the most vindicated.

Alabama Congressman Bradley Byrne is on the growing Pence heap.

In a statement distributed to multiple media outlets, Coffman said that “for the good of the country and to give the Republicans a chance of defeating Hillary Clinton, Mr. Trump should step aside.”
Nebraska Senator Deb Fischer wasn’t just a Trump supporter, she led the attack on those who failed to fall in line. But apparently her big swig of Trump-Aide has worn off.

""It would be wise for him to step aside and allow Mike Pence to serve as our party's nominee.""
Yeah, another reminder: it doesn’t work that way. Still, all these “let Pence have it” statements have to really be making it super chummy at Trump / Pence headquarters.

Alabama Congresswoman Martha Roby also backed away from the orange maniac.

Donald Trump's behavior makes him unacceptable as a candidate for president, and I won't vote for him.  … it is abundantly clear that the best thing for our country is for Trump to step aside and allow a responsible, respectable Republican to lead the ticket.

Alaska Senator Lisa Murkowski  pulled the plug on her support, and gave a very weak “get out” whisper.

I cannot and will not support Donald Trump for president. He has forfeited the right to be our party’s nominee.

Utah Senator Mike Lee gave a video un-endorsement calling on Trump to step aside, but didn’t name his preferred candidate.

Utah Congresswoman Mia Love proved that there’s no one left in Utah who supports Donald Trump.

For the good of the party, and the country, he should step aside. 
Illinois Senator Mark Kirk is desperate for anything that will save his flagging chances at holding his seat, and called on Trump to “drop out” so the GOP can name an “emergency replacement.”

The emergency in this case? Trump being Trump.

West Virginia Senator Shelley Moore Capito earned a spot in Profiles in Mediocrity with a solid maybe.

“The appropriate next step may be for him to reexamine his candidacy.”
WITHDRAWING THEIR SUPPORT OF TRUMP

Nevada Senator Joe Heck is in the neither / nor club.

I can no longer look past the pattern of behavior and comments that have been made by Donald Trump. Therefore, I cannot in good conscience continue to support Donald Trump nor can I vote for Hillary Clinton.  My wife, my daughters, my mom, my sister and all women deserve better. All Americans deserve better. 
Note that Heck was perfectly fine with Trump cheating on his wife, groping is daughter, attacking a Gold Star mom, and generally saying horrid things about women up to now. Some of whom were surely also sisters.

Utah Congressman Jason Chaffetz is right there with him.

“I can not support in any way, shape or form the comments or approach Donald Trump has taken.”

“This is so over the top, it is not even acceptable in locker rooms,” Chaffetz said. “It shouldn’t be acceptable anywhere. We are talking about the president of the United States. I want someone of high moral values.”
Chaffetz idea of “high moral values” apparently included someone who bragged about cheating in his book, but not admitting to actual sexual assault. Nice to know where the line is.

Utah Governor Gary Herbert also says he can no longer vote for Trump. Honestly, Gary Johnson’s chances of carrying Utah are looking better by the second.

Mitt Romney was already NeverTrumperInChief, and now he’s busy filling out 5,000,000 “told you so” cards.

“I was offended and dismayed by what was said and done by Mr. Trump. I think it’s degrading to our women, our daughters, our granddaughters and future generations,” he said.
Jeb Bush was already on the don’t support list, and remains there.

John Kasich had been wobbling his way toward an endorsement, but is feeling pretty good about not getting there.

And Arnold Schwarzenegger, who is of course famous for his own sexual discretion and marital fidelity, thinks Trump is a star too far.

AND NOW, STILL PLAYING FOR TEAM SEXUAL ASSAULT …

House Speaker Paul Ryan who says he’s “sickened” by Trump’s statement, and withdrew from a joint event, but has neither called on Trump to resign or withdrawn his support of Trump.

Arizona Senator John McCain who said there were “no excuses” for Trump’s statements, but hasn’t provided an excuse for why he still supports Trump.

Florida Senator Marco Rubio who said Trump was “vulgar, egregious & impossible to justify” but also proved to be a very little man.

Texas Senator Ted Cruz was late to endorse Trump, but hasn’t rescinded that endorsement. When the biography of Ted Cruz’ life is written, it will not include a chapter titled “His brilliant timing.”

RNC Chairman Reince Priebus is, of course, as a soppy jerkwad as always, and his statement was as weak as he is.

Kentucky Senator Mitch McConnell said … oh, who cares. It’s Mitch McConnell. He last showed political bravery on he 12th of never. Of course he didn’t withdraw his endorsement.

Oh, and Hugh Hewitt said something. But who cares?

100415,1002,Implicit Bias: The New ‘Original Sin’,http://www.breitbart.com/big-government/2016/10/08/implicit-bias-youre-guilty-even-though-youre-innocent/,16,"Progressives are seething because Republicans are committing blasphemy.
In his vice-presidential debate, Governor Mike Pence took a swing at one of the Left’s most cherished beliefs: “implicit bias.”

The police officers who support Donald Trump, he said,  “hear the bad mouthing, the bad mouthing that comes from people that seize upon tragedy in the wake of police action shootings as a reason to use a broad brush to accuse law enforcement of implicit bias or institutional racism.” Hillary Clinton sees “implicit bias” not just in the police force, but in “everyone in the United States,” Pence declared.

Liberals cannot brook criticism of their precious “implicit bias” theory, which is a new rationalization for totalitarian power, for rule by the progressive Elect whose Ivy League training has equipped them to sniff out the witch of hidden racism.

At Slate, William Saletan tried patronizing Pence with a “Dear white people, we need to have a talk” article, urging people of pallor to just relax and accept that they suffer from a psychic disease Doctor Government can treat, but never truly cure:

Every day, in one city or another, black and brown parents sit their kids down and talk to them about bias. They explain that at some point, based on the color of your skin, you might be suspected of doing something wrong. Don’t go to certain places, don’t wear certain clothes, and don’t move in any way that might be construed as a threat. Play it safe.

White people don’t have to talk to our kids this way, because our color doesn’t attract suspicion. We need to have a different talk, not about suffering implicit bias but about practicing it.

Here’s the first ground rule: “Implicit bias” isn’t an accusation. It doesn’t mean you’re bad. It means you’re normal. Animals prejudge one another based on appearance. Human beings are naturally tribal. So implicit bias, as a disposition, isn’t something you learn. It’s something you learn to overcome.

Here’s the second rule: When somebody brings up implicit bias, don’t freak out. Don’t get defensive and shut down the discussion.

To his credit, Saletan chastises liberals, and even Hillary Clinton in particular, for throwing around baseless accusations of racism, alienating large numbers of people by calling them “irredeemable” occupants of a “basket of deplorables.”

But then he explains that implicit bias is the kinder, gentler version of the systemic-racism argument, and we’re not supposed to question it, because we are absolved of conscious guilt. We don’t even realize how biased we are – it’s something only the credentialed elites of the Ruling Class can perceive with clarity:

But “implicit bias” is the opposite of “deplorable.” The whole point of the theory of implicit bias—the reason why it can fairly be attributed to everyone—is that it’s not an accusation of guilt or bigotry. It’s an acknowledgment of the human condition.

There’s way too much research on implicit bias to deny its existence. And there are way too many cases that illustrate it. In Tuesday’s debate, moderator Elaine Quijano mentioned Sen. Tim Scott, a black Republican who, as an elected official earlier in his career, “was stopped seven times by law enforcement in one year.” Other well-known figures, from former Attorney General Eric Holder to broadcaster Don Lemon to professor Henry Louis Gates Jr., have reported similar experiences. And then there are the men whose final moments many of us have witnessed, in all their horror, thanks to mobile phone videos. You can’t watch the deaths of Terence Crutcher, Eric Garner, and Philando Castile without being shaken. In most cases, what you see in the video, or in direct testimony after the tragedy, is the officer’s fear.

… The Implicit Association Test—which you can take on the Project Implicit website—“shows biases that are not endorsed and that may even be contradictory to what one consciously believes.” For instance, “you may believe that women and men should be equally associated with science, but your automatic associations could show that you (like many others) associate men with science more than you associate women with science.” Does that make you a bad person? No. Does it affect your behavior? Probably. Should you own up to your bias and try to overcome it? Absolutely.

This is essentially a religious command to confess your Original Sin in exchange for some small voice in negotiating your punishment. The difference is that Christian religion views atonement and penance as individual affairs. But the progressives’ Church of the State wants to stuff entire populations into its confessional at once, and then padlock the doors.

Saletan is right about implicit bias theories being more “useful” than old-school rants about universal broad-brush racism – as in, more politically useful to statists. It’s easier for the masses to swallow, because it absolves them of conscious guilt, replacing it with subliminal guilt.

Also, Saletan says white people don’t have to teach their children to worry about being the victims of implicit bias, because their “color doesn’t attract suspicion.” That’s not true at all. It’s not difficult to find neighborhoods or universities where white skin color does generate a damaging response. 

Part of the problem with this “implicit bias” theory is that it’s so unwilling to come to terms with the idea that everyone makes judgments. In fact, that’s the essence of being human — the ability to understand data, share experiences, calculate probability and respond rationally to best protect themselves and their loved ones. 

Whether trying to avoid crime, to enjoy romance or to profit from gambling, to succeed in work or to avoid car-crashes, humans must make quick judgements based on limited information, and they do it by learning from books and experience. They can’t approach each new problem as if they are a blank-sheet baby free off any bias or preferences — or else they’ll be mugged, dumped, broke, unemployed and car-less in very short order. 

Liberals are trying to clutter up that reality by inventing ever more esoteric justifications for giving themselves more power over everyone’s lives.

We’ll doubtless be arguing about police bias and profiling for many years to come, but on this topic, the hard truth is that some portion of that “implicit bias” is logical. The Left is driving our society insane by forcing it to ignore blatant realities of urban crime known by every rookie cop.

Likewise, whatever “implicit bias” association of men with science that might be ferreted from the public mind is probably connected to the higher number of male scientists – especially male scientists the layman has heard of, which is a rather small group, and its maleness partly is a function of unchangeable history. Despite fervent political assertions to the contrary, there is little reason to believe the continuing prevalence of men in various scientific fields is the result of a nefarious misogynistic conspiracy to keep lady doctors down.

It is wise to become nervous when politicians begin touting vague psych research — instead of replicable research or cold, hard numbers — to justify their agendas. Every flavor of statism has taken a stab at classifying resistance to its demands as insanity. In the less brutish incarnations of statism, this is done for the precise reason implicit bias advocates so eagerly state: to relieve the masses of individual, conscious responsibility for their fatal flaws. You’re not evil, you’re sick, they tell us. Sickness can be treated.

Statists understand that average people view government’s destructive powers as a force that should be deployed primarily against criminals… so they teach everyone to think of themselves as criminals. We all deserve to be punished for our social-justice transgressions, fined heavily for unfairly benefiting from implicitly biased society, and controlled lest we prey upon one another.

Conservatives learn from history, and so they trust people enough to delegate power and autonomy to individuals of every background. Criminal law is reserved for actions, while thoughts remain private beyond the reach of legislators, cops or priests. Hope for absolute justice is reserved for dreamers and scribblers and is postponed into the afterlife. The past is kept in the past, so people look forward, instead of perpetually fighting over the sins or sufferings of their great-great-grandparents. 

But statism uses coercive force to impose collective “justice” in this fallen world, which requires unjust treatment of today’s people for yesterday’s sins, so the Elect can build a heaven on Earth by tomorrow.

“Innocent until proven guilty” is the self-restraint of leaders willing to delegate power, while “guilty until proven innocent” is the justification and tool of impatient utopians, whether they be progressives, socialists or the Taliban. 

We don’t need our inept, greedy Ruling Class fooling around with any more victimhood theories, pushing beyond “guilty until proven innocent” to a new vision of “guilty even though you are innocent.”  Watching progressives try to open this Pandora’s Box of ego and cruelty is like watching clowns juggle dynamite in a crowded school."
100416,1002,"Exclusive – Breitbart/Gravis Colorado Poll: Donald Trump, Hillary Clinton Tied in Key Western Battleground State",http://www.breitbart.com/2016-presidential-race/2016/10/08/exclusive-breitbartgravis-colorado-poll-donald-trump-hillary-clinton-tied-key-western-battleground-state/,16,"Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump is tied with Democratic opponent Hillary Clinton in the all-important western battleground state of Colorado, a new Breitbart News Network/Gravis Marketing survey from the state shows.
In the poll of 1,246 registered voters in Colorado conducted on Oct. 3 and Oct. 4, Trump and Clinton both received 40 percent of support from those surveyed. Libertarian Gary Johnson got 10 percent, and Green Party candidate Dr. Jill Stein got 3 percent, while 6 percent were unsure. The poll has a margin of error of 2.8 percent at the 95 percent confidence level and was conducted using a combination of automated telephone calls and an internet panel of cell phone users. The results have been weighted by voting demographics.

Fifty-six percent described the country as going in the wrong direction, while 36 percent described it as going in the right direction and 8 percent didn’t know. A total of 50 percent either strongly or somewhat approved of the job President Barack Obama is doing—32 percent strongly and 18 percent somewhat—while 49 percent total disagreed, with 10 percent somewhat and 39 percent strongly.

Both Trump and Clinton have high unfavorables, but Trump’s were higher among those polled. Fifty-three percent of those surveyed viewed Trump as strongly unfavorable and 7 percent considered him somewhat unfavorable, with just 38 percent—22 percent strongly and 16 percent somewhat—considering him favorable. Clinton’s numbers are similarly bad, with 50 percent considering her strongly unfavorable, 6 percent somewhat unfavorable, 18 percent somewhat favorable, and 25 percent strongly favorable.

On issues, Trump seems to fare better than Clinton.

A whopping 65 percent considered it a bad idea for President Obama and Hillary Clinton to hand over U.S. control of the internet to an international body, and only 8 percent considered it a good idea, while 13 percent don’t know enough about the issue and 14 percent were unsure. Forty-five percent said they agreed with Donald Trump that NAFTA—the North American Free Trade Agreement that Bill Clinton signed into law in the 1990s and is supported by his wife Hillary Clinton—is the worst trade deal in modern history and that the Clinton-backed Trans Pacific Partnership is almost as bad. Only 33 percent didn’t agree with Trump on the issue, while 22 percent didn’t know.

A majority, 53 percent, said Obamacare was not a success, while just 35 percent said it was a success.

When asked about refugees, voters were aligned in a significant majority against Hillary Clinton’s plans to bring in more.

“Hillary Clinton’s supporters at the Refugee Council want to increase the number of refugees coming into the United States in 2017 even more, to 200,000, and Hillary wants to increase the number of Syrian refugees in that total from 10,000 in 2016 to 65,000 in 2017. Do you approve or disapprove of this increase?” the respondents were asked.

60 percent—a solid majority—said they disapproved of Hillary Clinton’s efforts on this front. Only 30 percent approved of Clinton’s refugee plan, and 11 percent were unsure.

This poll is the second in as many weeks from Breitbart News and Gravis Marketing that shows a close race in Colorado, which has 9 all-important electoral votes that could decide the election. The previous poll had Trump leading Clinton by 4 points, just outside that survey’s margin of error. Trump, on Monday of this week, held a pair of events in Colorado—and this poll was conducted while he was doing those events and in the immediate aftermath.

Combined with current polling in other battleground states—where Trump is ahead in states like Nevada, Ohio, Iowa, and Maine’s second congressional district, and polling even with Clinton in North Carolina, Florida, and Pennsylvania among other states—Trump would have enough electoral votes to win the election were it held now if current polling were correct.

At Trump’s Colorado events earlier this week, as Breitbart News reported from on site, he had thousands upon thousands of people attend."
100417,1002,"WikiLeaks, Video: Hillary Clinton Touts H-1B White-Collar Outsourcing Program",http://www.breitbart.com/2016-presidential-race/2016/10/08/hillary-clinton-promotes-h-1b-outsourcing-wikileaks/,16,"Hillary Clinton repeatedly touted the H-1B white-collar outsourcing program while meeting behind closed doors with technology companies, Wall Street firms and banks during 2013 and 2014, according to a collection of her comments released by unknown hackers.
“The only point I would make for the tech community is on the H1B visas, I support them. When I was a Senator from New York I supported them,” she told a meeting hosted by a software company in August 2014, according to a document apparently prepared by her campaign team. 

The 72-page document lists many of the controversial statements she made in 2013 and 2014, presumably to help her staff prepare responses if the speeches are were released. The new comments add to an extensive list of other pro-H-1B statements by Clinton. 

Currently, the federal government is providing multi-year H-1B work visas to roughly 650,000 foreign graduates to work in jobs sought by American graduates.

The foreign graduates fill 100,000 teaching, research and medical jobs at American colleges, they fill engineering jobs at Caterpillar in Illinois, up to 70 accounting jobs at McDonalds’ headquarters in Ohio, plus many more medical, teaching, management and software jobs in Florida, Connecticut, and California and throughout the United States.

“So let me just make three quick points,” she said in April 2014, at a summit hosted by a marketing company. “One, I think it’s essential to keep focused on the [H-1B] visa issue, because that’s a discrete problem that even though I’d like to see it be part of an overall, comprehensive reform, you have to keep pushing to open the aperture, you know, get more and more opportunities.”

The marketing firm, Marketo Inc., hires H-1Bs in place of Americans, according to a website that tracks H-1B hires.  In contrast, Trump produced a plan in May to reform the H-1B program so that it doesn’t outsource Americans’ jobs. The plan promised to:

Increase prevailing wage for H-1Bs. We graduate two times more Americans with STEM degrees each year than find STEM jobs, yet as much as two-thirds of entry-level hiring for IT jobs is accomplished through the H-1B program. More than half of H-1B visas are issued for the program’s lowest allowable wage level, and more than eighty percent for its bottom two. Raising the prevailing wage paid to H-1Bs will force companies to give these coveted entry-level jobs to the existing domestic pool of unemployed native and immigrant workers in the U.S., instead of flying in cheaper workers from overseas. This will improve the number of black, Hispanic and female workers in Silicon Valley who have been passed over in favor of the H-1B program. Mark Zuckerberg’s personal Senator, Marco Rubio, has a bill to triple H-1Bs that would decimate women and minorities.

Requirement to hire American workers first. Too many visas, like the H-1B, have no such requirement. In the year 2015, with 92 million Americans outside the workforce and incomes collapsing, we need companies to hire from the domestic pool of unemployed. Petitions for workers should be mailed to the unemployment office, not USCIS.

Many of the H-1B visa-holders manage to convert their work-permits into Green Cards, so they can become long-term residents of the United States. For example, data provided by one visa-tracking site, MyVisaJobs.com, shows that the H-1B program has pumped at least 100,000 foreign professionals into Michigan, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin, where they now compete against white-collar Americans.

The inflow of foreign workers, both blue collar and white-collar, drives down wages and raise profits, according to a September 22 report by the National Academies of Science, Engineering and Medicine. That “immigration tax” transfer roughly $500 billion per year from Americans worker to employers, shareholders and to new immigrants. In June, 2013, Clinton told an event for a personnel-management trade association that she agreed with their call for government to expand the H-1B program to start providing work-permits to all foreigners who graduate from U.S. colleges with masters’ degrees. She declared:

Specifically about H-1B visas, you know, we give so many more student visas than we give H-1B visas … I support what you’re trying to do because I think our economic recovery is to some extent fueled by a steady stream of well-qualified, productive workers coming out of our own institutions, native born, legally here and those who have something to contribute who are going to help us continue to grow our economy.

On the 2016 campaign trail, her campaign has repeated that offer to “staple Green Cards” to foreigners’ college degrees.

In 2013, Clinton supported a similar provision that was included in the Senate’s “Comprehensive Immigration Reform bill, but the measure was eventually killed by GOP grassroots opposition in June 2014. If it had been enacted, it would now be providing companies with an unlimited supply of lower-wage foreign graduates to hire instead of American graduates. 

Clinton’s open-borders promise to foreign graduates is posted at her campaign site, and is titled “Hillary Clinton’s Initiative on Technology & Innovation.”

But Clinton’s support for H-1Bs is just a corner of Clinton’s larger support for tight cooperation between government and major corporations, regardless of national borders.

In 2013, she told one audience that “my dream is a hemispheric common market, with open trade and open borders, some time in the future with energy that is as green and sustainable as we can get it, powering growth and opportunity for every person in the hemisphere.” That statement was made in May 2013 to an audience invited by Banco Itau.

Her dream for every “person” presumably includes the 320 million Americans in the United States — but it apparently also includes roughly 470 million other people in the hemisphere, from Argentina to Brazil to Venezuela to Honduras to Mexico and Canada.

The November election is intended to pick a president for the United States, not a president for the hemisphere.

For Clinton, those national barriers and politicians’ duties to national populations are washed away by immigration. At the Nexenta event, for example, she described her country as merely “a nation of immigrants.” In fact, the United States is a nation of 280 million Americans who have invited 40 million foreign to join them in the United States.

But she is a politician, and knows that if she wants to be elected, so must be careful to make token statements to reassure voters. At the Nexenta event where she praised the H-1B outsourcing program and the 2013 mass-immigration bill, she also suggested that companies try to show some “sensitivity” towards American job-seekers.

But given the great recession and the fact that so many people lost jobs across the economy including in the tech field, there has to be an extra effort made to try to fill jobs with people who are already here. They can be either native born or immigrants, but already here, so that then if that’s not possible you have a good faith argument that you tried, because too many people [think] the H1B visas are, instead of an opportunity to get good, strong talent, a way of avoiding hiring American workers. So I do think there has to be some sensitivity to that, but I believe that’s doable.  I don’t think that’s an overwhelming task. But the request for “sensitivity” come from Clinton, who also told another audience in April 2013 that government officials often need to work behind-closed doors.

“If everybody’s watching, you know, all of the back room discussions and the deals, you know, then people get a little nervous, to say the least. So, you need both a public and a private position,” she said, according to the leaked document.

Each year, 4 million Americans turn 18 years old and enter the workforce. But, each year, the federal government also imports 2 million immigrants, guest-workers, refugees and asylum seekers and illegal immigrants. The inflow of professionals and workers drives down the salaries of American white-collar and blue-collar workers while boosting income for investors and employers.

The inflow also crowd the schools used by the children of lower-income Americans, sharply increases tax transfers from Americans to immigrants, reduces innovation and productivity, pushes many lower-skilled Americans out of the workforce, and enables large-scale violence by immigrant communities and crime against Americans who do not live in protected neighborhoods.

Few of the elite leaders in the GOP or the Democratic Party care about the costs or risks of mass immigration."
100418,1003,Trump: Can It Get Any Worse?,http://www.huffingtonpost.com/mark-silva/trump-can-it-get-any-wors_b_12406638.html?utm_hp_ref=politics,16,"Let’s start with Donald Trump’s wife, Melania.

That seems like a good starting point for a story about a guy running for president who has bragged of grabbing other women_—_actually “bitches,” in his words_—_by their private parts and taking them down for sex, though admittedly failing to win over one even after taking her shopping for furniture. That’s the daily story today about Trump, who has managed to place obscene four- and five- letter words on the front pages of newspapers the day before a nationally televised debate with Hillary Clinton that he really must win to remain in contention for president of the United States.

In a statement issued today, Trump’s third wife said:

“The words my husband used are unacceptable and offensive to me. This does not represent the man that I know. He has the heart and mind of a leader. I hope people will accept his apology, as I have, and focus on the important issues facing our nation and the world.”

Take note, also, there is no comment here from anyone but Republicans.

There’s Trump running mate Mike Pence, who by most accounts prevailed with a calm demeanor and seasoned political skills in his one-and-only debate with Clinton running mate Tim Kaine_—_performing better than the party’s nominee managed to during his first encounter with Clinton.

“As a husband and father, I was offended by the words and actions described by Donald Trump in the eleven-year-old video released yesterday,” Pence said today of the hot-camera, hot-mic words recorded in Trump’s self-described “locker-room banter’’ with Hollywood Access’ Billy Bush in 2005_—_footage reported only now by the diligent Washington Post reporter, David Fahrenthold, who has spent months unraveling the myth of the Trump Foundation as a charitable enterprise.

“I do not condone his remarks and cannot defend them,’’ Pence said. “I am grateful that he has expressed remorse and apologized to the American people. We pray for his family and look forward to the opportunity he has to show what is in his heart when he goes before the nation tomorrow night.”

Sen. John Thune of South Dakota, third-ranking Republican in the Senate, called it time for Trump to call it quits: “Donald Trump should withdraw and Mike Pence should be our nominee effective immediately,” the senator said on Twitter today.

And late this afternoon comes Sen. John McCain, the Arizona Republican who ran as the party’s nominee for president in 2008, with a statement that now aligns his sentiments with those long voiced by the 2012 nominee, Mitt Romney:

“I have wanted to support the candidate our party nominated. He was not my choice, but as a past nominee, I thought it important I respect the fact that Donald Trump won a majority of the delegates by the rules our party set. I thought I owed his supporters that deference,” McCain said.

“But Donald Trump’s behavior this week, concluding with the disclosure of his demeaning comments about women and his boasts about sexual assaults, make it impossible to continue to offer even conditional support for his candidacy. (His wife) Cindy, with her strong background in human rights and respect for women, fully agrees with me in this.”

The McCains say they’ll not vote for Clinton but will instead write in “some good conservative Republican who is qualified to be president.”

Republican National Committee Chairman Reince Priebus, whose “Victory” program reportedly has put a “hold on all projects” for Trump’s candidacy today, had this to say last night about Trump’s sex talk: “No woman should ever be described in these terms or talked about in this manner. Ever.”

House Speaker Paul Ryan, the Wisconsin Republican, uninviting Trump from a rally in his home state today, offered this comment:

“I am sickened by what I heard today. Women are to be championed and revered, not objectified. I hope Mr. Trump treats this situation with the seriousness it deserves and works to demonstrate to the country that he has greater respect for women than this clip suggests.”

Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, the Kentucky Republican who’s fighting to maintain control of his chamber in an election that could cost his party several Senate seats_—_largely because of Trump’s place atop the ticket:

“As the father of three daughters, I strongly believe that Trump needs to apologize directly to women and girls everywhere, and take full responsibility for the utter lack of respect for women shown in his comments on that tape.”

Then there’s Sen. Kelly Ayotte of New Hampshire, one of the Republicans McConnell has been hoping to save. For months, she’s been waltzing around the Trump problem in her party. She holds but a 2 percentage point edge over her Democratic rival in a state where Clinton is leading Trump by five, in the average of the latest polls. The dance stopped today:

“I wanted to be able to support my party’s nominee, chosen by the people, because I feel strongly that we need a change in direction for our country,” Ayotte said in an issued statement. “However, I’m a mom and an American first, and I cannot and will not support a candidate for president who brags about degrading and assaulting women.”

Now Trump has made his own new video, offering a statement issued after midnight. Considering what all these people within his own party have had to say about the Billy Bushwhacking, it’s only right to play them in full:

“I’ve never said I’m a perfect person, nor pretended to be someone that I’m not. I’ve said and done things I regret, and the words released today on this more than a decade-old video are one of them. Anyone who knows me, know these words don’t reflect who I am. I said it, it was wrong, and I apologize.

“I’ve travelled the country talking about change for America. But my travels have also changed me. I’ve spent time with grieving mothers who’ve lost their children, laid off workers whose jobs have gone to other countries, and people from all walks of life who just want a better future. I have gotten to know the great people of our country, and I’ve been humbled by the faith they’ve placed in me. I pledge to be a better man tomorrow, and will never, ever let you down.

“Let’s be honest. We’re living in the real world. This is nothing more than a distraction from the important issues we are facing today. We are losing our jobs, we are less safe than we were eight years ago and Washington is broken. Hillary Clinton, and her kind, have run our country into the ground.

“I’ve said some foolish things, but there is a big difference between words and actions. Bill Clinton has actually abused women and Hillary has bullied, attacked, shamed and intimidated his victims. We will discuss this more in the coming days. See you at the debate on Sunday.”

Now the debate tomorrow at Washington University in St. Louis is a “town hall-styled” forum, where members of the audience will ask questions. Since his humbling in the first debate with Clinton, who displayed the cool that Pence showed in his face-off, Trump has suggested that he might be ready to talk about her husband’s infamous infidelity_—_and even suggested at one of his rallies, without any support, that Hillary too has been unfaithful to Bill.

It’s difficult to imagine either Trump or Clinton opening this conversation, which means moderators Anderson Cooper of CNN and Martha Raddatz of ABC will have to find a way in. It’s intriguing to imagine the conversation they’re having about how that question will be phrased. Once it’s out there, though, there may be no retreat to any corner of decency, no apology good enough for the 80-some million people likely to tune in.

Trump insisted in phone calls to the Washington Post and Wall Street Journal today that there is “no chance” that he will withdraw from the race, as “some people”_—_words Trump loves to employ in his own unsubstantiated statements_—_suggest. In this case, close to two dozen GOP somebodies, including Utah’s Sen. Mike Lee, whom Trump has suggested as a candidate for the Supreme Court.

Hugh Hewitt, the conservative radio commentator for the Salem Radio Network, a Harvard graduate who worked in Ronald Reagan’s White House and oversaw the construction of the Richard M. Nixon Presidential Library as its executive director, took to Twitter today, a forum where Trump is fond of taunting opponents.

This is what Hewitt tweeted:

“For the benefit of the country, the party and his family, and for his own good, @realDonaldTrump should withdraw. More and worse oppo coming”

Can it really get any worse?"
100419,1003,The Latest Trump (And GOP And Media) Fiasco In Nine Points,http://www.huffingtonpost.com/cas-mudde/the-latest-trump-and-gop_b_12406618.html?utm_hp_ref=politics,16,"The candidacy of Donald Trump has led to many “firsts” in US politics. Among them is also the first time that both the male and female genitals have become topics of official campaign discussion. The latest - although probably by the time I finish this blog post there is already a newer - Trump scandal is about a secret tape in which he brags about grabbing women “by the pussy,” which were made during a bus conversation with Today Show host Billy Bush - who, for inexplicable reasons, is still not fired by NBC.

As so often in this presidential campaign, the media is by and large failing us, breaking news (although often by being handed the information rather than by investigative journalism), sensationalizing it, and then not following up on it with critical analysis of what is really happening. So, here is my quick analysis, summarized in nine points.

(1) This is about sexual assault, not about sexist remarks!

The story was broken by Washington Post reporter David Fahrenthold in a piece entitled “Trump recorded having extremely lewd conversation about women in 2005.” But the essence of the piece was not “lewd conversation,” it was straight-up sexual assault and (probably) rape. In the conversation with Bush, on a bus, Trump bragged about kissing women without consent and grabbing them between their legs! Thát was the story: sexual assault, not sexist remarks!

(2) If it were about sexist remarks, there would be no reason for the “outcry.”

In fact, if the story was truly “just” about sexist remarks, as also almost all GOP politicians (pro- or anti-Trump) emphasized, there would have been absolutely zero news value in it. You hardly have to go to 2005 to find sexist remarks by Donald Trump. He makes them constantly, and not just in the locker room either - just remember the “blood coming out of her wherever” remark about Fox News anchor Megan Kelly.

(3) If this is your “locker room banter” you should change your gym!

Donald Trump himself lightly dismissed the remarks as “locker room banter,” a phrase that was eagerly adopted by GOP and Trump surrogates in an (not unsuccessful) attempt to distract the discussion from their candidate - as was the predictable attack on Bill Clinton, which Fox News presenter and Trump booster Sean Hanley ran away with. Again, the issue here is sexual assault (i.e. criminal behavior) and not sexist remarks (i.e. legal speech). But if you do want to go there, this is not normal locker room banter! I have never heard anyone talk openly and proudly about sexually assaulting a woman in any locker room - and I am certain that, if I had, I wouldn’t have laughed like a sexually frustrated teenager (as the still not fired Billy Bush did). Still, if this truly is what your locker room banter is like, I advice you to immediately change your gym!

(4) GOP “outcry” is about the messenger, not the message.

Since the news broke most high-ranking Republicans have denounced Trump’s remarks - while completely ignoring his claimed behavior - although very few have openly renounced their endorsement of him. Even the ones that are, behind closed doors, trying to get Trump to step back, are clearly much more upset about the messenger than about the message. They are worried that Trump is too damaged to win the elections. Hence, they are looking for someone else who can more successful promote roughly the same message.

(5) This is not about your daughters and wives, it is about all women!

Another striking aspect about the response of many Republicans is there personalization of the remarks. They also seem mainly concerned about their own female relatives, endlessly referring to their daughters and wives, rather than about women in general. In short, we don’t want you to talk about our women like that - although Ted Cruz seems perfectly fine with working for a man who has made numerous sexist and degrading remarks about his own wife.

(6) Don’t insult (our) white women but feel free to attack all non-white minorities.

Similarly, it is very telling that (only) these remarks were unacceptable to so many Republicans, who have been silent or tolerant towards Trump often even worse remarks about other groups. He has likened Muslims to snakes and terrorists and Mexicans to criminals and, oh irony, rapists. And yet, it was only when he spoke bad about (our) white women that these Republicans were “appalled” and started to doubt their support for Trump.

(7) Republicans will probably lose with Trump but certainly without him.

The fact that high-ranking Republicans are wasting their time even considering alternatives for Trump - like running-mate Mike Pence and failed 2012 candidate Mitt Romney - shows how delusional they are about both Trump and the Trump phenomenon. There is little to no realistic chance that Trump will gracefully bow out of the race - even if he would withdraw, and that is an enormous if, he will undoubtedly make it look like it was a conspiracy and he was the victim of the GOP elite. Any removal of Trump, however spinned by the Republican establishment, will ensure that a sizeable part of the real Trump electorate will not vote in next month’s elections. They already now hate the GOP establishment almost as much as they hate Hillary Clinton. In short, while the Republicans will probably lose with Trump, they will certainly lose without him!

(8) It is crucial for US democracy that Trump is defeated by the electorate, not by the GOP establishment.

The backroom deals that are going on within Republican circles are not just problematic for the GOP, they constitute a serious threat to liberal democracy in the country. It will “prove” to the hardcore Trump supporters that they have no voice in the current democratic system and that when they finally play by the rules, the establishment intervenes. This will undoubtedly lead to many of Trump supporters to (again) turn their back on the democratic system and the electoral process. This is problematic from a broader democratic point of view, which holds that democracy functions best when as many people as possible participate. But it is also worrying because it concerns a specific part of the population that is particularly susceptible to conspiracy theories and is heavily armed.

(9) The only hope for the GOP is a Goldwater moment.

Those that truly want to reform the Grand Old Party, and take it back from the radical right of both Trump and Cruz (as well as many others), should let Trump contest the elections on his own accord and wait for a Goldwater moment, i.e. a massive electoral defeat that will allow political space for a fundamental reform of the party. Only if Trumpism is electorally defeated will leading Republicans have the opportunity and will (courage would be too big a term) to pull the party back into a liberal democratic direction, and (re)build the heavily damaged relationships with the groups that will define the majority of the electorate in the years to come, most notably Hispanics and women."
100420,1003,Did Donald Trump Cheat On His Social Security And Medicare Taxes?,http://www.huffingtonpost.com/nancy-altman/did-donald-trump-cheat-on_b_12402450.html?utm_hp_ref=politics,16,"In 1995, did billionaire Donald Trump pay less for Social Security and Medicare than minimum wage workers paid? Has he paid less in every subsequent year? If he did, he probably cheated.

The only way to know for sure is to see his federal income tax returns. But there is indeed evidence already in the public domain that suggests that, on top of being a racist, a misogynist, and a xenophobe, Donald Trump is a tax cheat.

The first page of Donald Trump’s 1995 New York resident income tax return, published by the New York Times, reveals that he reported on his 1995 federal tax return that he had just $6,108 in salary for the year. On that small salary, just $378.70 would have been paid for Social Security and just $88.56 for Medicare, for a grand total of just $467.26.

That same year, workers, earning the 1995 federal minimum wage of $4.25 an hour, made $8,840 for full time work. On those wages, $676.26 was paid for Social Security and Medicare - $209 more than paid on the reported salary of the billionaire Republican presidential nominee. (The above numbers combine the total Social Security and Medicare liability. If a worker has an employer, the amount is split evenly between the two; individuals who are self-employed are liable for both the employer and employee portion.)

Donald Trump earned a salary of only $6,108 in 1995? Less than a minimum wage worker? Hard to believe. And, indeed, it is contradicted in a report filed in 1997 with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission. The report, which was filed by the Trump Hotel and Casino Resorts, Inc., a Trump-controlled corporation that apparently owns and operates all of Trump’s properties, states that Donald J. Trump received a salary of $583,333 and “other compensation” of $4,830,000 for a total of $5,413,333. If all of that income should have been assessed for Social Security and Medicare, Trump should have paid a total of $164,575.46!

So which is it? In 1995, did Trump and his corporation pay $164,575.46 for Social Security and Medicare, just $467.26, or some amount in between? And what was he required to pay? There is no way to know without seeing his federal tax return. (The first page of the New York return shows a large amount of business income, but without his federal tax return, it is impossible to know whether any self-employment tax was paid on that income.)

What is known is that Social Security and Medicare are cheated out of billions of dollars of revenue every year. And Trump may be doing his part.

By law, all covered workers are required to contribute to Social Security and Medicare. It doesn’t matter if you are a high school student scooping ice cream on your summer vacation or the CEO of a Fortune 500 company. All covered workers are required to contribute, based on their earned income.

But do they? Most workers have their Social Security and Medicare contributions withheld from their paychecks. But those who don’t, if they are dishonest, can underreport or not report their earned incomes. The stereotype of unreported income is under-the-table payments to domestic workers or payments for illegal activities like drug deals. But Donald Trump may be an example of the wealthiest engaged in this same kind of illegal activity. If you are Donald Trump and other wealthy moguls, rather than using cash payments, you can simply hire accountants and lawyers, set up Subchapter S corporations and limited partnerships, and mischaracterize salary as profits.

This scam appears to be quite widespread. Because both former Democratic Vice Presidential nominee John Edwards and former Republican Speaker of the House (current Trump adviser and surrogate) Newt Gingrich cheated the government in this way, the practice has become known as the Edwards-Gingrich loophole. But don’t be confused by the name. It is not a loophole. It is a hard-to-prove mischaracterization of salary. Like paying workers under the table or labeling your employees as independent contractors, it is cheating.

How widespread is it? A GAO study reviewing 2003 and 2004 tax returns calculated that Subchapter S corporations mischaracterized earned income by a whopping $23.5 billion, resulting in underpayments to Social Security and Medicare of billions of dollars in just those two years.

Like most other crimes, this fraudulent mischaracterization is not victimless. When cheating is done with respect to domestic and other low-income workers, those individuals are denied the disability, survivor, retirement, health, and unemployment protection the law requires they have.

If Donald Trump, Newt Gingrich, and their wealthy compatriots are illegally avoiding paying what they are obligated under the law to pay for Social Security, Medicare, Unemployment Insurance, and Workers’ Compensation, they may be able to get by without the benefits, but they are cheating us.

Social Security and Medicare work so efficiently and well because they are universal. Given the perilous and rising income and wealth inequality over the last few decades, I do not believe the wealthiest are paying their fair share. But, it appears that Trump and his plutocrat friends may not even be paying what they legally owe already.

Again, it is impossible to know if one of those plutocrat-cheats is Donald Trump without seeing his tax returns. But perhaps that is one of the reasons he is being audited.

It is amazing he is being audited for any reason, given the efforts of those in Congress to protect him and his fellow elites. Thanks to budget cuts, the rate of individual tax returns being audited is lower than it has been in over a decade.

But Congress’s protection of the wealthy is even worse. One of the truly outrageous requirements imposed on the Internal Revenue Service is to spend their limited resources disproportionately on those returns of people who claim the Earned Income Tax Credit (“EITC”).

The EITC was enacted in 1975 to give the working poor a better return on their work by offsetting some of their work expenses, including their contributions to Social Security and Medicare, with a refundable income tax credit. Those working Americans, by definition, have very little income.

In order to claim the EITC, those working poor must file tax returns. Those returns make up around 19 percent of all returns filed. Yet they consist of a ridiculous 35 percent of all audits. Even if those returns have errors, the amounts, obviously, are small. So why does Congress insist that their returns be audited twice as frequently as returns generally? To protect the wealthy and to spitefully make life even more difficult for those struggling to make ends meet are the logical explanations.

Social Security should be expanded for those working poor and for all Americans. Those expansions can and should be paid for by making millionaires and billionaires pay their fair share. And while we are at it, let’s make sure that they pay every penny that the cheaters among them are failing to pay now. The perfect poster boys for this effort are John Edwards, Newt Gingrich, and, quite likely, Donald J. Trump."
100421,1004,Trump Supporters Heckle Elected GOPers: ‘You Turned Your Back On Us!’,http://talkingpointsmemo.com/livewire/paul-ryan-joe-heck-heckled-trump-hot-mic,16,"Some voters greeted prominent Republicans with boos and loud heckling at Saturday events, after the officials spoke out against the vulgar and predatory remarks Donald Trump made about women in a newly unearthed recording.

“Paul Ryan sucks!” Milwaukee resident Paul Anderson yelled at a fall festival in Elkorn, Wisconsin, where the House speaker addressed a crowd, according to the Los Angeles Times.

“You turned your back on us,” other hecklers shouted, breaking into chants of “We want Trump!”

Trump was originally supposed to appear with Ryan at the event. But Ryan disinvited Trump hours after the recording surfaced, releasing a statement saying he was “sickened” by the GOP nominee's remarks. The joint appearance would have been Ryan's first campaign event with Trump.

In Las Vegas, Rep. Joe Heck (R-NV), who's running to replace Senate Minority Leader Harry Reid (D-NV), also was booed loudly as he read a statement calling for Trump to withdraw and be replaced by a candidate “with honor” who deserved to be president. This backlash came a day after the Washington Post published a video of Trump talking about groping women without their permission. In the 2005 clip from an ""Access Hollywood"" taping, Trump says on a hot mic that he used his celebrity status to force himself on women, kissing them and even grabbing them “by the pussy.”

The video has thrown the Republican Party into turmoil, with prominent elected officials including Sen. John McCain (R-AZ), the party's 2008 presidential nominee, and Sen. John Thune (R-SD) withdrawing their endorsements or calling for Trump to drop out.

Even as party leaders distanced themselves from their own nominee, Trump vowed to stay in the race and his supporters lashed out at prominent GOPers' lack of support for him.

At the fall festival on Saturday, Ryan only briefly acknowledged the “elephant in the room” at the start of his address before pivoting to a discussion of Republican priorities, like repealing Obamacare. Yet the crowd in Elkhorn wasn’t ready to move on, lashing out at the House speaker for leaving their candidate swinging in the wind so close to Election Day.

Local TV station WHAM reported that some attendees yelled “Shame! Shame!"" at Ryan as he left the stage. "
100422,1004,GOP Sen. Blunt Still Stands With Trump After Video Debacle,http://talkingpointsmemo.com/livewire/blunt-trump-hot-mic-video,16,"SPRINGFIELD, MO -- As other Republicans -- including a senator in a tough reelection race -- withdraw their support of Donald Trump after the release of a 2005 tape in which he discussed making unwanted sexual advances on woman, Sen. Roy Blunt (R) showed no signs of reversing his support of Trump in a brief interview with TPM after a campaign event in Springfield, Missouri.

“I am glad to see that he understands more about the country now than he believes he did when this process started,” Blunt said, referring to a comment Trump made in his apology for the remarks. “I think if you want to solve the problems that have been created over the last eight years, you can’t have a third Obama administration. So he needs to be vigorous in explaining how he is a different man than that person, but how he hopes to lead the country and I think he may very well get that done.”

The Washington Post published the video Friday afternoon, just as Blunt was in between events in the Springfield after. After his last event of the day he told a National Review reporter he had not yet heard the tape. Later that night he tweeted that Trump's remarks were “disrespectful and inappropriate” while noting the video apology Trump had released. Blunt is in a competitive re-election race with Missouri Secretary of State Jason Kander (D). Trump is polling handily ahead of Hillary Clinton in the state.

A number of elected Republicans have said that they cannot vote for Trump after the tape, including Sen. Kelly Ayotte (R-NH), who is facing a tough re-election race against Gov. Maggie Hassan (D-NH).

Asked by TPM if he was worried about the effect the Republicans' withdrawals of their Trump endorsement could have down-the-ballot, Blunt said, ""I am not worried about that.”"
100423,1004,Reports: Pence Won't Sub For Trump At Campaign Event With Paul Ryan,http://talkingpointsmemo.com/livewire/pence-cancels-campaign-appearance-with-paul-ryan,16,"Various news outlets are now reporting that Mike Pence has cancelled a planned campaign appearance in Wisconsin, where he was to appear with Speaker of the House Paul Ryan (R-WI) in the place of Donald Trump, who was disinvited late Friday. The cancellation comes in the wake of the Washington Post's bombshell revelation of a 2005 video recording of Trump making crude and derogatory comments about women and describing his own predatory advances on women, including grabbing their genitals.

Trump was originally scheduled to appear with Ryan at the state GOP event in what would have been their first campaign appearance together. Ryan announced late Friday, after the video emerged, that Trump would no longer be attending. Coming from Ryan, rather the Trump campaign, the announcement was widely interpreted as Ryan disinviting his own nominee, with whom he has had a turbulent relationship.

A short time later, Trump announced that Pence would be attending in his place: ""Governor Mike Pence will be representing me tomorrow in Wisconsin. I will be spending the day in New York in debate prep with RNC Chairman Reince Priebus, Gov. Chris Christie and Sen. Jeff Sessions, and then flying to St. Louis on Sunday for the 2nd Presidential Debate.""

Pence was still scheduled to attend the event with Ryan until midday Saturday, when reports emerged Pence was scrapping the appearance. The reasons for Pence's cancellation were not immediately clear."
100424,1005,"New Tapes Reveal Trump Lewdly Discussing his Daughter, Black Women, Threesomes, and More",http://www.motherjones.com/politics/2016/10/cnn-stern-audio-trump-ivanka-threesomes-sex,16,"On Saturday afternoon, CNN published several audio clips from the Howard Stern show, of conversations between Donald Trump and Howard Stern. In the freshly rediscovered clips, Trump makes lewd comments about his daughter, Ivanka, and discusses his thoughts on sex with women who are menstruating, sex with black women, threesomes, sex addiction, sex with Miss USA contestants... and more.

Several of the clips feature Trump discussing Ivanka's physique. In a September 2004 interview, Stern asks Trump if he can refer to Ivanka as ""a piece of ass."" Trump says yes. ""My daughter is beautiful, Ivanka,"" says Trump, and after a bit of back and forth, Stern asks: ""Can I say this? A piece of ass,"" to which Trump responds with ""Yeah."" In an October 2006 interview, when Stern made a comment about Ivanka's breasts and asked if she had gotten implants, Trump responded with, ""She's actually always been very voluptuous. She's tall, she's almost 6 feet tall and she's been, she's an amazing beauty.""

Mother Jones and other outlets have previously published clips of Trump making crude comments about women on Stern's show, including one where he calls Jennifer Lopez's butt ""too fat."" In another, Trump responds to a question from Stern about whether he'd stay with Melania if she was disfigured in a car accident by asking, ""How do the breasts look?""

In a 1997 interview clip unearthed by CNN, Stern asks Trump if he's ever had sex with a menstruating woman. ""Donald, seriously, you would not, right, am I correct?"" Stern says.

""Well, I've been there. I have been there, Howard, as we all have,"" Trump answers.

Later in the same interview, Stern asks Trump if he's ""ever had a black woman in bed."" Trump responds by asking Stern what his ""definition of black"" is. ""Interesting, his bed is a rainbow. I like this discussion,"" Stern says. ""The rainbow coalition, as Rev. Jesse would say,"" responds Trump.

In additional interviews published by CNN, Trump calls age 35 ""check-out time"" when it comes to leaving women, and responds to a question about whether he's had a threesome: ""Haven't we all? Are we babies?"" In another interview, he implies that he's had sex with Miss Universe or Miss USA contestants, saying: ""It could be a conflict of interest. But, you know, it's the kind of thing you worry about later, you tend to think about the conflict a little bit later on."""
100425,1005,Here Are 5 Outrageously Offensive Things That Didn't Cause Republicans to Abandon Trump,http://www.motherjones.com/politics/2016/10/republicans-are-fleeing-trump-after-video-surfaces-him-bragging-about-groping-women,16,"It's been less than 24 hours since a 2005 video of Donald Trump bragging about groping women created a political firestorm Friday afternoon. By Saturday morning, Republican elected officials were issuing ""unendorsements"" of Trump and calling for him to withdraw from the GOP ticket. It turns out that saying ""grab 'em by the pussy"" is one offensive comment too far for many Republicans. But those who did endorse Trump were overlooking a lot of other actions that had tainted Trump—and his supporters—since he announced his candidacy last year.  

Here is just a sampling of the deplorable things Trump has said and done—and that Republicans now looking for a lifeboat had previously decided to overlook:

Trump not only endorsed but enthusiastically championed the racist ""birther"" conspiracy theory that President Barack Obama was not born in the United States. He did not abandon this position or apologize for it when he entered the presidential race. It wasn't until last month that Trump finally acknowledged Obama was born in the United States.
Trump's offensive comments about immigrants and people of Mexican heritage have been a major feature of his campaign. He called undocumented immigrants from Mexico rapists on the first day of his candidacy. ""They're bringing drugs,"" he said. ""They're bringing crime. They're rapists."" He never apologized. Trump later alleged that a US-born judge with Mexican heritage could not be fair to him because of Trump's views on immigration.
Trump suggested that Fox News' Megyn Kelly treated him unfairly during a GOP primary debate because she was on her period. Perhaps not coincidentally, it was Kelly's questions about Trump's treatment of women—and particularly his habit of calling them ""fat pigs, dogs, slobs, and disgusting animals""—that he objected to.
Trump attacked Khizr and Ghazala Khan, Muslim Gold Star parents whose son died in the Iraq War. The Khans had appeared onstage at the Democratic National Convention; Khizr Khan blasted Trump's proposal to bar all Muslims, including Muslim US citizens, from entering the United States. Following their appearance, Trump was particularly insulting to Ghazala Khan, suggesting that the grieving mother had stood silently alongside her husband at the convention because her Muslim faith did not allow her to speak in public. (Ghazala Khan later spoke publicly about the incident on MSNBC and published an op-ed in the Washington Post.)
Trump has welcomed the support of the feverishly racist wing of the conservative movement. Perhaps the best example of this came when he refused for five days to condemn David Duke, the former leader of the Ku Klux Klan, who is supporting him. Not long afterward, Trump's campaign allowed a leader of a white nationalist party to be a delegate for his campaign in California (until the story became national news). Even after these high-profile episodes, the campaign continues to wink and whistle at white supremacists. A white nationalist super PAC is today spending money to help elect him.
Trump's latest comments about women are obviously out-of-bounds behavior. But many Republicans will now have to explain why they found his previously known comments and actions acceptable."
100426,1005,Melania Trump Breaks Silence About Her Husband’s Sexual Assault Boast,http://www.motherjones.com/politics/2016/10/melania-trump-reaction-trump-tape-boast-grope,16,"Melania Trump issued a statement Saturday afternoon calling her husband's boastful comments about groping women ""offensive"" and ""unacceptable""—though she didn't condemn the specific behavior that Donald Trump had bragged about.

""The words my husband used are unacceptable and offensive to me,"" read the statement, which was released by the campaign. ""This does not represent the man that I know. He has the heart and mind of a leader. I hope people will accept his apology, as I have, and focus on the important issues facing our nation and the world.""

Her reaction comes just under 24 hours after the Washington Post published previously unaired footage from 2005 of Donald Trump and TV host Billy Bush discussing how the GOP nominee hit on a married woman and how Trump believed he could ""do anything"" to women.

Melania Trump's statement comes amid a deluge of criticism from Republican leaders, many of whom have begun to withdraw their endorsements for the nominee and call for him to drop out of the race. You can see the growing list of dissenters here. "
100427,1006,Trump’s midnight apology video offers a hint of what’s to come,http://hotair.com/archives/2016/10/08/trumps-midnight-apology-video-offers-hint-whats-come/,16,"Talk about “fortuitous timing” if you happen to be a Democrat! Last night Allahpundit wrote about the latest October surprise which was unleashed on Donald Trump in the form of an Access Hollywood hot mic conversation involving The Donald and Billy Bush. It was all the buzz on social media and threatened to swamp the ongoing coverage of Hurricane Matthew on cable news. Everyone was wondering if something this potentially bruising would elicit an actual apology from Trump, and more than ten hours after the release – in fact close to midnight – the GOP nominee released a video on Facebook with his mea culpa. (ABC News)

Caught on tape making shockingly crude comments about a married woman he tried to seduce, Donald Trump declared in a midnight video, “I was wrong and I apologize.” Yet even as he did so, he claimed the astonishing recording was “nothing more than a distraction” and argued his words were not nearly as egregious as former President Bill Clinton’s marital affairs.

“I’ve said some foolish things,” the Republican presidential nominee said in a taped apology posted on his Facebook page early Saturday morning. “But there’s a big difference between the words and actions of other people. Bill Clinton has actually abused women.”

Turning to his Democratic rival Hillary Clinton, Trump accused her of having “bullied, attacked, shamed and intimidated” her husband’s “victims.”
Most of the cable news outlets are only showing excerpts, so here’s the entire thing via YouTube. It’s only about 90 seconds long. Is it going to satisfy any of Trump’s critics? Obviously not, but that’s not the point of an October surprise. Trump actually uttered the phrase, “I was wrong and I apologize,” but nobody looking to sink Trump’s campaign was ever interested in an apology no matter how much they were demanding one in advance. If they had been, you’d see a line of them queuing up this morning to say, well okay then. Just make sure you don’t do it again.

Where did the tape come from? There are already long, scholarly pieces being written on the subject. The phrases I’ve heard repeated most often this morning on both CNN and MSNBC are variations of, a tape stored on a dusty old shelf at NBC. Give me a break. This is part of an oppo file which has been out there since last year and held in reserve until the timing was right to inflict maximum damage and distract from any other bad news about Clinton. And given the decades that Donald Trump spent in the limelight giving interviews such as this one, going on the Howard Stern show and dealing with everyone from Hollywood, New York and Washington glitterati circles there are probably enough such pieces to drop one every three days from now through the election. You can expect to see plenty more.

So I suppose the two main questions are whether or not this would be enough to chase Trump out of the race (as some are suggesting) and if it will turn off enough additional voters to lock him out of the White House. The answer to the first question appears to be an obvious and resounding “no.” The second question is still up in the air. Is anyone truly surprised that Trump would engage in that sort of locker room discussion? I know I wasn’t and among those who were already firmly supporting him I’m guessing this sort of thing is baked into the cake. When we were chatting about this subject on Twitter last night I freely admitted that I’d engaged in worse talk as a young man. But to be fair, it was the seventies and I was in the Navy. The old saying about having a mouth like a sailor didn’t enter our lexicon out of pure fiction.

But beyond that, there are plenty of non-sailors out there who have done the same and I hear worse from younger men I know to this day. I can assure you that there are plenty of men out there expressing shock and disgust today who are uncomfortably wondering who might recall conversations they had as younger men. The main difference is that most of us didn’t have people with cameras and microphones following us around all the time. But that doesn’t mean that there won’t be a significant number of people (particularly those without a Y chromosome who typically aren’t exposed to such chatter) who will be honestly put off by this and perhaps even change their vote. This was a bad news cycle for Trump and there’s no getting around it.

Going back to the whole convenient timing thing, we should also note that a new batch of Wikileaks documents dropped last night which contain all sorts of goodies about Hillary Clinton, including outtakes from some of her paid speeches to Wall Street. (We’ll have more on that later today.) Is anyone leading their cable news broadcasts with it this morning? Nope. There’s barely a peep. You can write all that off to coincidence if you like, but this sort of “accident” is a rare beast in American politics. All we can really say to the Clinton team at this point is… well played."
100428,1006,Leaked emails appear to show Clinton campaign illegally coordinating with Soros,http://hotair.com/archives/2016/10/08/leaked-emails-appear-show-clinton-campaign-illegally-coordinating-soros/,16,"You wouldn’t know it from the cable news crapstorm currently going on over Donald Trump’s 2006 bus ride with Billy Bush, but there was another Wikileaks document drop yesterday. While there’s plenty of material to dig through, the Daily Caller almost immediately highlighted one item which could involve a violation of the law on the part of the Clinton campaign. Super PACs and other outside groups spending big money on political advertising aren’t supposed to be coordinating with the campaigns they support, but at least one email exchange between Clinton campaign chair John Podesta and an organization run by Democrat super-donor George Soros clearly seems to show just such joint planning taking place.

The group is the Open Society Foundations (OSF) which is directly financed and directed by Soros, and they are working on various Social Justice Warrior issues such as “reforming” the nation’s police in support of Black Lives Matter. In the leaked exchange between Podesta and Chris Stone, the president of OSF, we see what looks to be obvious message coordination.

A December 2015 email exchange between Podesta and OSF president Chris Stone was included in the batch of Podesta’s emails released by WikiLeaks on Friday.

“Hi, John. Your policy team was asking me for ideas on police reform a couple of months ago. Here’s a concrete idea I’ve written up, and a good hook for it in Chicago,” Stone wrote.

Stone attached to the email an article he wrote that advocated putting federally-funded bureaucrats in charge of police oversight.

“Thanks Chris. Will circulate. Hope all is well,” Podesta replied.
Is this the sort of thing that anyone will notice, say nothing of bring before the FEC in the midst of such a chaotic election cycle? Proving any sort of illegal coordination between PACs and campaigns is widely acknowledged as being notoriously difficult and the FEC rarely even tries to go after anyone. But that doesn’t mean that it never happens. One case which was successfully prosecuted involved the 2006 race of Republican Congressman Joe Schwarz of Michigan, and the evidence the FEC cited looks suspiciously similar to what’s been revealed here. (Center for Public Integrity, emphasis added)

The most recent FEC investigation regarding coordination was settled in May 2009 and involved the election committee of former Rep. Joe Schwarz, R-Mich., and the Republican Main Street Partnership PAC.

The FEC uncovered emails spanning six months in 2006 between members of the PAC and the Schwarz campaign. One email revealed Schwarz campaign director Matt Marsden had contacted the PAC’s treasurer with a suggestion for a radio ad on behalf of Schwarz. One week later, two radio stations ran ads following the theme the Schwarz director suggested. Other emails revealed Schwarz staffers recommended which radio stations the PAC should target.
Unfortunately, the Schwarz case highlights how sketchy (and virtually pointless) some of these campaign finance laws are. This was a situation where they had emails in hand showing the coordination (much as we seem to have with Podesta and OSF now) and it still took the FEC three years to make their way though the case. And in the end they handed down a $2,500 fine to the campaign and that was the end of it. The Clinton team could cover a fine like that out of their donut and coffee fund for one campaign office.

Of course, coordination between campaigns and big money groups is one of those dirty little “open secrets” which everyone knows about but rarely discusses. Who knows what goes on during private phone calls and email exchanges unless a leak like this takes place? And even when you find out, it’s too easy to simply say that the campaign was just hitting a hot topic which much of the country was already talking about anyway. In the end, I don’t know if this is more of a signal that Clinton’s campaign should be prosecuted or that we should just abandon these silly rules once and for all."
100429,1006,FBI agents reportedly close to revolt over Comey’s friendly treatment of Clinton,http://hotair.com/archives/2016/10/08/fbi-agents-reportedly-close-revolt-comeys-friendly-treatment-clinton/,16,"All through the FBI investigation into Hillary Clinton’s private bathroom email server and the exposure of classified information, I tended to take a wait and see attitude and gave FBI Director James Comey significant benefit of the doubt, if not outright praise at times. He was digging up a lot of information and, as I saw it, going out of his way to keep the public informed as to what was being found and the direction the case was taking. Even at the end, while highly dubious about his conclusion, I found myself having at least a bit of sympathy for him when considering the mountain he would have had to climb in bringing charges against a presidential candidate in the middle of a heated campaign, not to mention the potential backlash from the various allies of the Clintons.

Since that time however, we’ve learned more and more about all the maneuvers which took place, largely to the benefit of Hillary Clinton and her staff. Some were truly spectacular in their jaw dropping nature and now it sounds as if at least some of the agents in the Bureau are fed up with Comey’s handling of the case. The New York Post spoke to some of them and describes them as being nearly in open revolt.

Veteran FBI agents say FBI Director James Comey has permanently damaged the bureau’s reputation for uncompromising investigations with his “cowardly” whitewash of former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton’s mishandling of classified information using an unauthorized private email server.

Feeling the heat from congressional critics, Comey last week argued that the case was investigated by career FBI agents, “So if I blew it, they blew it, too.”

But agents say Comey tied investigators’ hands by agreeing to unheard-of ground rules and other demands by the lawyers for Clinton and her aides that limited their investigation.

“In my 25 years with the bureau, I never had any ground rules in my interviews,” said retired agent Dennis V. Hughes, the first chief of the FBI’s computer investigations unit.
The list of perceived sins which have angered some of the agents is lengthy. One of the most recent (and perhaps worst) was Comey’s choice to agree to destroy Cheryl Mills’ laptop after an investigation into its contents was severely limited. The agents also cite the number of witnesses who were offered immunity in exchange for testimony, including some who might have wound up being targets of the investigation themselves. That’s understandable in many criminal cases because you’re willing to let some of the smaller fish walk if they help nail down the primary target. But as noted in the interviews, the agents were quick to point out that some of these immunized witnesses still suffered critical memory lapses when recounting the events surrounding the handling of the server.

I still find it difficult to believe that the fix was in and Comey intentionally let Clinton off the hook out of some loyalty or lack of objectivity. Perhaps I’m just naive, but the man stood on a long and distinguished record of service before this all began, spanning administrations from both parties. He simply doesn’t strike me as the sort of person who would sell out his integrity that cheaply. But that doesn’t mean that he didn’t turn tail and back off when the job looked too tough to drag across the finish line. And if some of his agents see this as damaging to the reputation of the Bureau, it’s hard to blame them."
100430,1007,WikiLeaks Reveals Hillary Will Go After Guns via Executive Order,http://www.youngcons.com/wikileaks-reveals-hillary-will-go-after-guns-via-executive-order/,16,"Not only have recent WikiLeaks leaks shown that Hillary Clinton is a fan of “open trade and open borders,” but a press secretary said the gun control loophole will be closed via executive order.

Of course, Clinton has to make it to the White House first.

Regardless of your thoughts on Donald Trump, priority one has to be keeping grandma out of the Oval Office.

From Breitbart:

The batch of emails released by Wikileaks on October 7 includes one in which Hillary Clinton press secretary Brian Fallon explained that Clinton “would support…closing the gun show loophole by executive order.”

Fallon also highlighted Clinton’s support of universal background checks–which have already failed in California, Colorado, Washington state, and Paris–and her support for a scenario wherein victims of crime would be able to sue gun manufacturers.


In the email, dated October 4, 2015, Fallon mentions that Today had made clear they were going to ask Clinton about guns. At that time she was still locked in a tougher stance than expected primary opponent Bernie Sanders. Fallon wrote:

Circling back around on guns as a follow up to the Friday morning discussion: the Today show has indicated they definitely plan to ask bout guns, and so to have the discussion be more of a news event than her previous times discussing guns, we are going to background reporters tonight on a few of the specific proposals she would support as President – universal background checks of course, but also closing the gun show loophole by executive order and imposing manufacturer liability. Even with all the hoopla surrounding Donald Trump’s leaked audio on women, he’ll still be a force in November.

A Clinton presidency will see many more immigrants and illegals brought into the country to help Democrats with future elections. "

Slick Willie settled a sexual harassment claim with Jones for $850,000 back in the day.

Jones’s thoughts…

From BizPac Review: “So Donald Trump had to apologize about the woman comments, ” she wrote. “I don’t recall that Bill or Hillary has apologized to me and Juanita Broaddrick or Kathleen Willey yet Bill was getting his wee wee sucked under the Oval Office desk and still won a second term, UNBELIEVABLE! No liberal ever questioned his ability to run our country then, why NOW with Trump..???? Two faced hypercritical liberals!”

It is ‘unbelievable.’ It’s also crazy to think I’m writing about the way Trump talks about women instead of the issues the country is really facing.

Did ISIS get blown off the map in the middle of the night? Has our $19-plus trillion debt been wiped out?

Did the majority of journalists suddenly become conservatives?

Come on, man."
100432,1007,OCTOBER SURPRISE: WikiLeaks Exposes Hillary Email Demeaning to Blacks and Muslims,http://www.youngcons.com/october-surprise-wikileaks-exposes-hillary-email-demeaning-to-blacks-and-muslims/,16,"Hillary Clinton – like all Democrats – counts on minorities to keep her in power.

Progressives will promise to keep redistributing cash and other freebies until the entire nation is broke, which ultimately keeps the uninformed shackled to the system.

Dependence on big government is key.

In return for putting progressives in office, these minorities and low-income white voters are merely the butt of the joke. They have no hopes of advancing from their minimum wage positions, because Democrats know if they move up they’ll eventually vote Republican.

Funny how that works.

Here’s exactly what grandma thinks of the people she needs to vote for her in November.


It’s not pretty for blacks and Muslims…

From Gateway Pundit: Hillary also trashed African Americans.

The main reason behind successful immigration should be painfully obvious to even the most dimwitted of observers: Some groups of people are almost always highly successful given only half a chance (Jews*, Hindus/Sikhs and Chinese people, for example), while others (Muslims, blacks** and Roma***, for instance) fare badly almost irrespective of circumstances. So, we’re clear who the racist is in this election, yes?

What’s worse?

Donald Trump talking the way guys talks behind closed doors about women?

Or, Hillary bashing entire races and religions?

Yeah, I know. Take your time.

100433,1008,"Clinton, Trump, and the Gap in America’s Infrastructure",http://www.americanthinker.com/articles/2016/10/clinton_trump_and_the_gap_in_americas_infrastructure.html,16,"Democrats have always gone misty-eyed over metaphors.  Perhaps it is the only means by which they feel their constituents can conceptualize complex ideas.

So it is not surprising that the Clinton campaign is attempting to throw a one-two punch at Donald Trump by smugly stating that, unlike him, its high-principled candidate believes in building bridges, not walls!

Well, the fact is that Hillary has never built anything her life… not even consensus.  I doubt if she knows the first thing about bridges other than that her driver had better get her official vehicle over them in time for some unimpressively-attended rally. As for walls, one has recently been constructed around her Chappaqua compound.

Over a decade ago, some members of Congress raised a big stink about what they termed “ The Road to Nowhere,” a derisive label unfairly applied to then Alaska Senator Ted Stevens‘ federal earmark in a transportation  bill to construct a bridge from mainland Ketchikan to  Gravina Island, on which the local airport is located.

Rather than leading “nowhere, ” the bridge would have been a much-needed alternative for those who even now must take a ferry from the mainland, often in choppy seas, across  part of Alaska’s Inside Passage to the island airport. (From personal experience, I know how unpleasant that can be in the rainy weather of the region.)

Since there are no roads over the Tongass mountains into Southeast Alaska, some 200,000 passengers annually depend on airline travel.  But as former Alaska Governor Sarah Palin put it, “Much of the public’s attitude toward Alaska bridges is based on inaccurate portrayals of the projects here.”

At around the same time as the Gravina Island bridge proposal was struck down, Senator Joe Biden of Delaware had little trouble getting approval for a new bridge, partly financed with federal funds, to be built over his state’s Indian River Inlet between the two beaches of Rehoboth and Bethany.   After a series of labor disputes and other complications, The Charles W. Cullen Bridge was finally completed in May 2012, just in time to accommodate summer beach-goers. 

The earlier Indian River bridges had fallen into dangerous disrepair, as has too much of the infrastructure in the United States. Our clogged, stalled cities now compare unfavorably with many of those in other countries, putting an unflattering face on America’s decline.  Immigrants who came to our shores in droves at the turn of the 20th century may have been disappointed not to see the streets paved in gold.  Now we are surprised not to find them riddled with potholes. 

Recently there was an illustrated list on the Net of the world’s current crop of spectacular and unusual bridges.    And while I was duly impressed, I was disappointed that not one of them was located here in the United States.

During the Alaskan “Bridge to Nowhere” fracas, Congress had expressed alarm at how high the bridge would have to be built to enable cruise ships and other substantial maritime craft to navigate beneath it.  Now the proponents of that project are reconfiguring the design.  But Japan apparently met the challenge of the Eshima Ohashi bridge which soars across Lake Nahaumi, rising at a gradient of 6.1% to allow ships to pass below. It was the generosity of Allied victors that rebuilt Japan after World War II.  Seventy years later, that country’s technology is putting America to shame.

During every election year, we hear the siren call to spend more taxpayer money improving our crumbling infrastructure.   We are lured by the promise of massive job creation. The first of the Obama administration’s stimulus bills – the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 -- pledged to go heavy on shovel-ready construction projects that would result in thousands of work opportunities.  But neither happened.  The president later joked that the shovels, it seems, weren’t ready.  Perhaps he was waiting for them to be shipped from China! 

Even if the shovel-ready construction jobs were for real, how many American workers are even trained to do them? The mindset of Americans has changed radically  since the dark days of The Great Depression, when pangs of hunger --  and even the possibility of starvation --  propelled desperate citizens to take on whatever employment they could find.  Some of our country’s most formidable infrastructure was built by willing, hard-working neophytes who learned as they earned.

But the current crop of out-of-work Americans has neither the empty bellies nor the fire in them to enlist in such physically grueling work.  Democrat politicians even mollycoddle the masses and justify illegal immigration by insisting there are jobs that Americas will not  -- maybe even cannot -- do!

So very likely, in order to get the massive projects done, we would have to import not just the shovels, but the men to wield them.  Although out population has multiplied many times since we industrialized America, we might still have to resort to what we did centuries ago: get our labor from the poorer  countries  around the globe.  Some of these imported workers will have had experience in building infrastructure “back home.”  Can any of the desk-chained bureaucrats in Washington sense the irony --and the tragedy! –- in this likely scenario?

The bottom line – and it’s written in red ink -- is that for all the funds expended, the administration’s vaunted economic policies have led  largely to a  dead end.  The promised bridges to prosperity went nowhere.  And now we find ourselves in yet another election year, thinking  -- to paraphrase   Ronald Reagan -- “Here they go again.”

When Donald Trump, a builder by profession, dares to speak out about the obvious deterioration of our airports, bridges, roads and railways, he is accused of needless pessimism.  That’s because politicians do not necessarily believe that honesty is the best policy.  I live in a state reputed to be the sixth largest economy in the world.  Some experts dispute this designation because it “ignores the real and structural long-term challenges facing the Golden State.”  One such challenge is our inadequate transportation system. 

The Golden State rail options, for example, are so limited that a trip on Amtrak generally assumes spending time on a bus. Jerry Brown’s signature boondoggle bullet train, designated to eventually run five hundred miles between Los Angeles and San Francisco, at present seems to be devoting its engineering resources to digging a deeper hole in which to pour money.

The ultimate price tag for the California High Speed Rail has (for now) been pegged at 64 billion, but its financial sources have dried up.  Brown will try to renegotiate some kind of state Cap and Trade deal in order to generate funds for his pet project.  In the meantime, it is grossly underfunded and hugely unpopular with residents.  California is deep blue politically, of course, but Trump is winning in polls among the voters of the Central Valley, where the eyesore is currently languishing among the tumbleweeds.

Some wag has suggested that Brown’s last hope for his bullet train might be a Donald Trump presidency.  After all, The Donald, who admires high-speed transportation, has said, “The Chinese have trains that go 300 mph.  We have trains that go chug-chug!”

100434,1008,Hillary's History of Denial,http://www.americanthinker.com/articles/2016/10/hillarys_history_of_denial.html,16,"Nearly twenty years ago, David Irving, a British historian of WWII and Hitler, sued American scholar of the Holocaust, Deborah Lipstadt, for defamation.  He claimed that her references to him as a Holocaust denier in her book, Denying the Holocaust, were harming his career. He was indeed a ""Holocaust denier,"" and remains one to this day.  But because British libel laws are different from American libel laws, Lipstadt and her publisher, Penguin, had to prove that Irving had intentionally falsified historical evidence to bolster his attempt to deny that Hitler had ordered the extermination of the Jews.   From Wikipedia: 

""Irving's decision to file his lawsuit in the English courts gave him the upper hand by shifting the burden of proof. Under American libel law, a public figure who claims to have been libeled must prove that the statements in question are defamatory, that they are false, and that they were made with actual malice or with reckless disregard for their truth or falsity. Furthermore, reliance on reliable sources (even if they prove false) is a valid defense. In contrast, English libel law requires only that the claimant show that the statements are defamatory. The burden of proof falls on the defendant to prove that the statements were substantially true, and reliance on sources is irrelevant. ""

Now there is a film about that trial, Denial. It stars Rachel Weisz and Tom Wilkinson and several other fine actors.  It is a riveting film.  Who in the 1990s could imagine a legal battle over ""did the Holocaust happen?""  But it happened.  It was a grueling, labor-intensive work of dedication to the truth.   Lipstadt's lawyers had to convince her that she should not testify nor should any Holocaust survivors be allowed to speak.  This was enormously counterintuitive to Lipstadt and to anyone watching the film. But her lawyers convinced her that the trial had to be about Irving, his writings, his filmed speeches.  He was already on film mocking survivors (as Hillary mocks Trump supporters).  They also convinced Irving that the trial should be by judge, not jury.   As Irving acted as his own lawyer, they appealed to his ego. Her lawyers convinced Irving that no Jury could possibly understand the nuances of his scholarship.  It worked and he agreed.

Irving had kept diaries for twenty years.  He was required to turn them over to Lipstadt's defense. The lawyers involved read every word he had written, for publication and in his diaries. His own words proved, without a doubt, that Irving had repeatedly falsified documents and photographs in order to ""prove"" that Hitler had never ordered the extermination of the Jews.  He even denied that Jews were ever gassed at the camps.  This was easy to disprove.  The trial was four years long from filing to verdict.  The judge took four weeks to review the material once both sides rested.  Judge Charles Gray decided in Lipstadt's favor and Irving had to pay all the legal expenses, $3.2m.  It bankrupted him but has not stopped him from spewing his viciously anti-Semitic and racist views around the world.

All of which brings us to the FBI's investigation of Hillary Clinton and her thoroughly illegal, clearly purposeful private server set up when she began her term as Secretary of State.  She had a get-rich-quick plan and implemented it the day she became a member of Obama's cabinet.  She set up that server and embarked on her pay to play scheme.  Foreign and domestic cronies came; they gave, they got what they wanted.  In return the money kept rolling in to the Foundation and huge, 6-digit checks were written for speeches by Bill and Hillary.  They earned hundreds of millions for ""speeches"" and favors during those four years.  This was her intent from the outset, beginning forty-some years ago.  They have earned all their money by gaining power and selling their access to it.  They have produced exactly nothing.  They are a blight on our political landscape.

Watching the film Denial one cannot help but compare the British justice system and ours re: the recent FBI investigation into Hillary Clinton's illegal activities that went nowhere.  Granted, this was not a trial but the Irving v. Lipstadt case was about the truth; James Comey's pretend investigation was about something else entirely. It was about protecting a corrupt political power player at all costs, but it cost Comey his credibility.   In some ways our system is better; had Irving sued in the US, he would have had to prove that what Lipstadt wrote was untrue, which he could not have done.  In the UK, she had to prove that what he wrote was false and that he knew it was false. James Comey listed Hillary's many violations in front of a Congressional committee.  He said she had broken numerous laws, was careless with top-secret material, that she lied countless times about many important things, that she and her aides destroyed thousands of emails and several devices. It was learned later that he had made numerous side deals that gave immunity to her aides and agreements that allowed them to destroy their devices.  Then he said he was not recommending charges because he could not prove she had ""intent"" to break all those laws!  What a crock!

Intent, justifiably, is what lost David Irving his case and Lipstadt's lawyers proved it beyond all doubt.  Comey surely knows Hillary had intent to deceive but let her skate and continue seeking the office of President.  So our two federal agencies charged with preserving justice have failed us.  A film script with this chain of events would not survive a first read-through.

Had a regular citizen committed even one of the crimes Hillary did, he or she would have been charged, convicted and imprisoned. Regarding Hillary, the fix was in of course.  Comey and AG Lynch most likely took their marching orders from Obama and they both sacrificed their souls and good name.  There are too many conflicts of interest to list here but suffice it to say that Comey is a political animal whose brother is the accountant for the Clinton Foundation, that he himself has benefitted from that Foundation and its donors' largess.   Obama probably does not hold Hillary in high regard but does not want a Republican to succeed him so he gave the order: she must not be indicted.

There obviously exists in the US a two-tiered system of justice based on political power.  People like the Clintons muscled and cheated their way into the presidency, the Senate, the State Dept., and out of too many scandals to list.  They never doubt that they will escape responsibility for the damage done or laws broken, nor for her casual abuse of national security concerns in order to shield her money-grubbing scheme from prying eyes.  They believe that she is entitled to the presidency; they will do anything to win it.  David Irving was certain he would win his case too.  He was so confident of his own intellectual power to persuade that he thought he could convince the judge that Hitler was a good guy, that six millions Jews were not exterminated, that blacks were inferior, and that he should be celebrated for his historical pseudo-scholarship.

There is a scene in the film where the judge asks if Irving actually believes what he says and writes, is that ""intent to deceive,"" can he be guilty if he actually believes his version of who Hitler was?  Lipstadt's barrister, momentarily stunned by the question, replied ""the bridge between Holocaust denial and Hitler apology from anti-Semitism is very easy to build, because what more would an historian who is an anti-Semite want to do in exculpation of Hitler, which he has been trying to do by telling lies for years, what more would he want to do than to deny the Holocaust?""

Like Irving, the Clintons absolutely believe in their own superiority and entitlement.  They always deny any culpability or responsibility for their thirty years of crimes against this country in service of their own power and wealth. Like Irving, they accuse anyone who questions their integrity of libel.  Hillary acted aggressively to slander the women with whom Bill dallied.  David Irving is a version of the Clintons; so wedded was he to his own ideology he thought all the ""right"" people would believe him.  He had contempt for anyone who disagreed with him.  The American left has nothing but contempt for their political opponents.  Hillary especially has contempt for the American people, all of them outside her rarified circle.  We are nothing to her but a means to an end.

She accuses ""all of us"" of being guilty of implicit bias and thinks that will win her votes.  She is the one with more bias than the lot of us.  She is our version of David Irving:  elitist, misguided and dangerous.  Voters must find her guilty by electing Trump.  History is on trial.  See the film.

100435,1008,ISIS Already Is Here,http://www.americanthinker.com/articles/2016/10/isis_already_is_here.html,16,"If this article by Adm. James Lyons (USN, ret) is correct, and I believe it is, ISIS will start to stage attacks on US home territory. 9/11/01 was one example of a Jihadist attack, backed by the same Sunni Wahhabi forces that has now declared that ISIS is conducting Islamic warfare following the ""proper"" war theology, including suicide-murders, genocide against civilians, horrific abuse of women and children, etc., all for the sake of Allah. Admiral Lyons has claimed high-level government penetration by Jihadists for years. Earlier this year the European Union was incapable of resisting a tide of Jihadi ""Syrian refugees,"" aided and abetted by Turkey's neo-Ottoman Jihadist, Recip Erdogan. (Many of the ""refugees"" had been settled in Turkey).

More than 30 million potentially radical Muslims have been imported over the years into Europe, constituting an enormous Fifth Column. The Saudis have built mosques for them, and staffed them with Wahhabi imams, who take their orders from a command structure with roots in the Middle East. The Sunni Muslim Brotherhood coordinates with the Wahhabi priesthood in Saudi Arabia, but when it comes to Jihad against the West, Iranian mullahs are involved as well.

Swedish politician Cecilia Hagen called parties opposed to mass Muslim immigration ""brown rats"" - brown being the color of WWII fascism. Since the police in  Malmoe, the rape capital  of Sweden, just  called for help to investigate and control the city murder rate,, it is clear that an atmosphere of Jihadist terror now prevails in parts of Sweden and Denmark. Jihadist ""no go"" zones have been reported in Germany, France and Britain. 

Because the European Union is all on the side of Muslim infiltration, the widespread rebellion against EU commands is also part of the emerging anti-Jihad resistance movement.

Western governments are reacting to the war of aggression waged against them with almost suicidal slowness and reluctance. Obama may be the worst example of a pro-Jihadist politician who is doing everything possible to undermine US defense. Jihadist infiltration and propaganda, large-scale bribery and probable widespread blackmail have been used, according to Adm. Lyons, since the late Sixties to early Seventies, when OPEC brought immense wealth and power to both Sunni and Shi'ite Gulf regimes.

This election is really about Jihad more than any other issue. Trump is openly anti-Jihad, while the Clinton Foundation has been funneling Jihad money to US politicians for years. Huma Abedin is from a Muslim Brotherhood family, and Hillary's email breach of normal State Department security procedures is only one of several massive USG leaks. Apparently Huma and Cheryl Mills had free access to high-value US intelligence communications, and were able to spread it with little concern for security.

Hillary's email scam made it possible to negotiate quid-pro-quos with anti-American forces around the world, with huge money flows to fund the Hillary campaign. Trump's low-funded but successful campaign (so far) came as a big surprise to Hillary, I believe. Trump's use of cheap but effective mass media like twitter is unprecedented, and balances Hillary's vastly larger financing. 

This Presidential campaign is therefore a component of the emerging world war, which has been planned and implemented by Jihadists since about 1970, according to Admiral Lyons. Obama's refusal even to utter the word ""Jihad"" as the name of the enemy suggests collusion with hostile forces.

Given the war theology of Jihad, the ""silent war"" of infiltration and sabotage could explode into violence at any moment. For example, Trump could be targeted for assassination -- which would be quite within the scope of Jihad doctrine. This is totalitarian warfare, and theoretically it has no limits. 

The current warning from Admiral Lyons and others suggests an ISIS attempt to flood the Western world with jihadis, who, like the rape invaders in Germany, go to earth quickly, aided by existing Saudi and Iranian Jihad networks.

After the big headlines in Germany, Frau Merkel literally prohibited the media from criticizing her. The Jihadi invasion quickly disappeared from most of the media. 

In the US, media concentration to half a dozen major corporate centers indicates a similar concentration of wealth and power. Mexican billionaire Carlos Slim now owns 17% of the New York Times, with its continuing high credibility among millions of followers.

It's noteworthy that the GOP leadership has buckled under just like the Democrats. The fact of FBI Director Comey's ties to the Clinton Foundation, plus his inability to indict the Clintons, indicate another breakdown of normal government. 

Two major dangers to the Jihad aggressors are (a) the possible election of Donald Trump, and (b) the rapid drop in the price of oil due to major new supplies from various sources. The Saudis are investing in US energy sources as a hedge against an OPEC crash. 

Notice that Obama has done everything possible to undermine domestic energy production.

The only precedent I know is Stalinist infiltration and sabotage of USG in World War II, culminating in the theft of Manhattan Project nuclear secrets by Klaus Fuchs and the Rosenbergs. When Stalin exploded his first nuclear device he took the US and our allies by surprise, leading to a public uproar, which is now remembered as ""McCarthyism."" In fact, McCarthy reacted against a deadly danger. 

Today, Jihadist forces are hiding the degree of their nuclear development, but according to former CIA analyist Claire Lopez, the Iranians are much more advanced than they admit in public.

We are going through the greatest period of US vulnerability and world-wide danger since Stalin exploded his first nuclear bomb. The Khrushchev biography of Kremlin politics when Stalin lay dying indicates that the inner circle, including Beria and Khrushchev, were very worried that he would order a nuclear war against the US from his deathbed. They may have killed him to avert a nuclear disaster. 

Jihad is influenced, if not controlled, by another gerontocracy, including Ayatollah Khamenei in Iran and the Saudi Royals in Riyadh. The Saudi King is said to be suffering from dementia today, and the real power is the Minister of Defense, Mohammed bin Salman Al Saud. 

The ongoing string of Jihad attacks in Europe indicates that the war theology has not given up. Since the basic facts have been (secretly) known to Western politicians since the years after 9/11/01, there is little doubt that Jihad attacks are meant to extract concessions from Western governments, such as Angela Merkel's opening the gates of her country to tens of thousands of Jihadis. 

Jihadist attacks are not random, but part of an overarching strategy that is constantly communicated by outfits like ISIS and Hezb’allah, who act as cut-outs and fronts for the Saudis, the Turks, and the Iranians. 

The US is confronting deadly dangers today, and with nuclear developments in the Middle East, it may get worse.

100436,1009,TRUMP’S APOLOGY,http://www.powerlineblog.com/archives/2016/10/trumps-apology.php,16,"Here is the text:

I’ve never said I’m a perfect person, nor pretended to be someone that I’m not. I’ve said and done things I regret, and the words released today on this more than a decade-old video are one of them. Anyone who knows me knows these words don’t reflect who I am. I said it, I was wrong and I apologize.

I have traveled the country talking about change for America, but my travels have also changed me. I’ve spent time with grieving mothers who’ve lost their children, laid-off workers whose jobs have gone to other countries, and people from all walks of life who just want a better future. I have gotten to know the great people of our country and I’ve been humbled by the faith they’ve placed in me. I pledge to be a better man tomorrow, and will never, ever let you down.

Let’s be honest, we’re living in the real world. This is nothing more than a distraction from the important issues we’re facing today.

We are losing our jobs, we are less safe than we were eight years ago and Washington is totally broken. Hillary Clinton and her kind have run our country into the ground. I’ve said some foolish things, but there’s a big difference between the words and actions of other people. Bill Clinton has actually abused women, and Hillary has bullied, attacked, shamed and intimidated his victims. We will discuss this more in the coming days. See you at the debate on Sunday.

There is one apparent difference between Trump and the Trump enthusiasts with whom we have become familiar. Trump has been persuaded that he has to pronounce an apology for things he has “said and done.” The video that prompted the apology did not simply reflect Trump’s vulgarity. It betrayed indefensible behavior in his own immortal words. Trump rightly shies away from acknowledging as much.

Let’s be honest, indeed. The apology focuses on words — “I’ve said some foolish things” — but there is more to it than that.

The apology takes a shortcut. When Trump says “there’s a big difference between the words and actions of other people,” he doesn’t quite complete the thought. He is saying the Clintons have said and done worse than he has said and done. He is saying that they have more for which to apologize than he does. It wasn’t a persuasive argument when we made it to our parents or we heard it from our kids and it’s not impressive from a candidate for the presidency of the United States.

Although Trump distinguishes his words and deeds from those of the Clintons, he seems to have something in common with Bill. Hillary is sui generis. We can agree on that. We may have to go to Shakespeare to find her like. But does Trump think he can defend himself by arguing that she is worse than he is? Here he leaves room for ambiguity. Perhaps he is promising to make the case that she is worse than the “better man” he will “be…tomorrow.”"
100437,1009,THE THREE FACES OF HILLARY,http://www.powerlineblog.com/archives/2016/10/the-three-faces-of-hillary.php,16,"
Quotable quotes from Hillary Clinton’s speeches to big banks and Wall Street firms are buried in other news today. They are derived from what appear to be John Podesta’s hacked emails. Tim Mak and Andrew Desiderio cull some of the highlights and embed the relevant links for Daily Beast readers in “Leaked Podesta emails show Bernie was right.” There is a distinctly postmodern quality to Clinton’s discussion of the necessity of maintaining “both a public and a private position” on politically contentious issues.

The whole thing reminds me of The Three Faces of Eve, the movie starring Joanne Woodward playing a woman with an alleged case of multiple personality disorder. The real life Eve died this past August. The New York Times published an interesting obituary by Bruce Weber. (Whether or not multiple personality disorder is fact or fiction remains a question beyond me.)

Hillary presents one face molded in the primary battle with Bernie Sanders in the current campaign. She presents another face — also a public face — to big buck donors behind closed doors. That is her high-priced face.

But she has at least one more face. It is the face that she presents in private, where she can share her true beliefs, whatever they are. God help us."
100438,1009,WHAT NOW?,http://www.powerlineblog.com/archives/2016/10/what-now-2.php,16,"The Trump campaign is bleeding profusely from the wound of his Access Hollywood video. Carly Fiorina and John McCain are among the prominent Republicans who have withdrawn their support.

There are also calls for Trump to step down as the Republican nominee. Andy McCarthy is among those urging this.

Trump, though, has said he will never stand aside. Conceivably, he will relent, but the choke artist seems determined to hang in there.

Bill Kristol recognizes this difficulty, but suggests that “if it were made clear to [Trump] that all endorsements were to be withdrawn and that all resources were to be denied—if Mike Pence were to resign from the ticket and Reince Preibus were to refuse any further help—Trump might be persuaded.” That’s a lot of “ifs” to culminate only in a “might.”

It’s also questionable whether, at this late date, Trump could be replaced. Shannen Coffin, another who says “the carnival barker” must go, acknowledges that “Trump can’t be removed from the ballot in most (if not all) of the States.” He adds that “there is no good mechanism to replace Trump with another Republican candidate.”

This, I imagine, is why it took so long for a video like the Access Hollywood one (who doubts there are others in the same genre?) to surface. This, and the fact that it was in the interests of the Democrats to see Republican candidates get on board with Trump before dropping the hammer.

Kristol suggests that “if the GOP electors in the various states agreed to vote in the electoral college for a candidate designated by the Republican National Committee—probably Mitt Romney, perhaps Mike Pence—these difficulties could be overcome.” Another big “if” culminates in a “perhaps.”

The most realistic assessment I’ve seen of the situation comes, I’m sad to say, from Chris Cillizza of the Washington Post. His article is called “Republicans made their bed with Donald Trump. Now they have to lie in it.”

That’s probably true as a general matter. But Cillizza’s piece would more accurately be titled “it’s every Republican for himself.” As his Republican sources suggest, GOP candidates will have to decide whether their current electoral interests are best served by abandoning Trump, as McCain has done, or staying the course. GOP leaders lucky enough not to be on ballot this year will have to decide which course best serves their future electoral interests.

This has always been the calculus, for most. But an important variable now has changed.

GOP candidates and leaders will have to make their decision soon, but not until the days immediately following tomorrow’s debate. If Trump somehow puts in a performance that stops the bleeding, the exodus of prominent supporters will probably halt.

Otherwise, GOP leaders will likely explore options such as the ones Kristol lays out, as unrealistic as they appear to be. But I see no option that doesn’t result in a Hillary Clinton presidency. If that’s the case, it may be that no course is better than letting this horror show play out, learning the lessons it has to teach us, and then picking up the pieces"
100439,1010,"As some Republicans repudiate Trump, the ‘Religious Right’ stands by their man",https://thinkprogress.org/trump-evangelical-board-cowards-49981a314945#.mgz9pd85o,16,"Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump’s campaign was thrown into crisis mode on Friday afternoon after the Washington Post released a video that showed him bragging about sexually assaulting women. Things got even worse next day, when CNN released audio recordings of Trump telling radio host Howard Stern that he could refer to his daughter as “a piece of ass.”
The political bombshells sent a shockwave through Trump’s support network, with several of his longtime backers condemning his remarks, rescinding their endorsement, or even calling on him to drop out of the race. Among conservatives—a group that has long championed “family values”—Trump’s comments finally appeared to be a bridge too far.
Yet one group has remained shockingly supportive of Trump: members of his Evangelical Executive Advisory Board, a cadre of pastors and religious leaders tasked with advising the candidate on matters of faith. Members of the board are not required to endorse Trump, and many have refused to do so (although their mere association with him has caused some evangelicals to levy accusations of spiritual cowardice).
Yet almost 24 hours since news of Trump’s comments broke, most members of the board—several of which are traditional leaders of the Religious Right—have yet to comment, and others have either explained away his remarks or reiterated their support for the candidate.
Below is a developing list of what members of the committee have—or haven’t—said in response to the video. (Note: other members of the Religious Right who are not on the committee have also re-upped their support for Trump, such as Tony Perkins of the right-wing Family Research Council, who said his endorsement of the businessman “was never based upon shared values,” or televangelist Pat Robertson, who excused Trump’s comments as him “just trying to look macho.”)
This post will updated as the faith leaders respond. Unless they don’t.

In an email to the Washington Post, Reed_—_head of Trump’s advisory board and the Faith and Freedom Coalition_—_the comments were “inappropriate,” but pivoted to attacking Clinton.
“But people of faith are voting on issues like who will protect unborn life, defend religious freedom, grow the economy, appoint conservative judges and oppose the Iran nuclear deal,” he said. He argued evangelical voters will still vote against Clinton, saying her “corrupt use of her office to raise funds from foreign governments and corporations and her reckless and irresponsible handling of classified material on her home-brewed email server, endangering US national security, that will drive the evangelical vote.”
“I think a 10-year-old tape of a private conversation with a TV talk show host ranks pretty low on their hierarchy of their concerns,” he said.
James MacDonald
MacDonald, a megapastor of Harvest Bible Chapel church, reportedly emailed the rest of the advisory committee to express his displeasure with Trump. His heated words were republished by Ed Stetzer_—_a professor at Wheaton College, an evangelical school_—_and while MacDonald clarified that he did not endorse Trump to begin with, and support he had for the candidate seemed to be all but gone.
The relevant sections are below:
Mr. Trump’s comments released yesterday_—_though 10 years ago (he was 60)_—_are not just sophomoric or locker room banter. They are truly the kind of misogynistic trash that reveals a man to be lecherous and worthless_—_not the guy who gets politely ignored, but the guy who gets a punch in the head from worthy men who hear him talk that way about women.
He then referred to his wife, daughter, and daughters in law.
I have a wife of 33 years, a daughter, and 2 daughters in law. I am not able to offer my time any further without an obvious “change of heart and direction” [that] true believers call repentance.
He called for Trump to seek repentance, and also questioned the true purpose of the council, saying it was “really kind of a joke.”
If Mr. Trump isn’t seeking our counsel now_—_1) to be repentant 2) on how to portray that repentance, then the idea of a faith council (which has deteriorated into influence brokering anyway) is really kind of a joke right? I have spent my life helping men get free from such disgusting commentary on women_—_even writing my doctoral dissertation on self-disclosure of sin among men. I cannot and will not offer help to a man who believes this kind of talk a minor error.
He closed by insisting that Trump’s comments, which have been defended or explained away by other members of the council, are indefensible.
No more defending Mr. Trump as simply foolish or loose lipped. Please pass this on to whomever you deem best.
Michele Bachmann
Bachmann dismissed Trump’s comments as “bad boy talk.” She has not rescinded her support.
Robert Jeffress
Jeffress, senior pastor of First Baptist Church in Dallas, told the Washington Post he believes Trump is “still the best candidate to reverse the downward spiral this nation is in.”
“While the comments are lewd, offensive, and indefensible … they are not enough to make me vote for Hillary Clinton,” he said, adding he would “not necessarily choose Donald Trump to be a Sunday School teacher” but he still supports him.
“To say Trump’s comments disqualify him from being president assumes that Hillary Clinton is more moral than Donald Trump,” he said. Ronnie Floyd
Floyd, pastor of Cross Church in Springdale, Arkansas, and author of The Gay Agenda, appeared to respond to the controversy by condemning both candidates. James Dobson
The host of the conservative radio show My Family Talk did not appear to respond to the controversy directly, choosing instead to tweet a message about forgiveness. UPDATE: Dobson has now officially condemned Trump’s comments, but repeated his support for him over Clinton.
“The comments Trump made 11 years ago were deplorable and I condemn entirely,” he said. “I also find Hillary Clinton’s support of partial birth abortion criminal and her opinion of evangelicals to be bigoted. There is really only one difference between the two. Mr. Trump promises to support religious liberty and the dignity of the unborn. Mrs. Clinton promises she will not.”
Jerry Falwell, Jr
The president of Liberty University, an influential evangelical Christian school, did not respond to requests for comment over the weekend. His press office told ThinkProgress:
“President Falwell’s High School aged daughter is on Fall Break and the family is spending time together. They are on a short trip. As such, he is not responding to media requests for interviews or comments at this time.”
UPDATE: While Falwell has yet to respond to media inquiries, he did tweet out the following praise for Donald Trump at the end of Sunday night’s debate. UPDATE 2: Falwell has now spoken to a radio station in New York City about the tapes. He condemned Trump’s remarks, but refused to rescind his support for the candidate, citing the need for conservative Supreme Court justices. He also blamed the release of the tapes on an internal RNC conspiracy.
“I think this whole videotape thing was planned, I think it was timed, I think it might have even been a conspiracy among the establishment Republicans who’ve known about it for weeks and who tried to time it to do the maximum damage to Donald Trump,” Falwell said. “Nothing he said in that tape was defensible. It was just a horrible thing. He apologized. He was contrite about it.”
In condemning Trump’s remarks, Falwell repeated an axiom now common among Trump’s steadfast backers: that he’s not a perfect candidate.
“There was nothing defensible,” Falwell told Crosby. “It was completely out of order, it’s not something I’m going to defend . . . it was reprehensible. We’re all sinners, every one of us. We’ve all done things we wish we hadn’t.”
“We’re never going to have a perfect candidate unless Jesus Christ is on the ballot,” he said. “I’ve got a wife and a daughter and nobody wants to hear their women talked about in that manner.”
As for Trump’s debate performance, he said he was “blown away,” adding, “No Republican could’ve done better,”
Harry Jackson
Jackson, pastor of Hope Christian Church in Beltsville, Maryland, has yet to make any comments himself. But on Saturday evening, he retweeted Dr. Darlette Stowers praising the remarks of Tony Perkins, another member of the Religious Right who has refused to rescind his support for Donald Trump, saying that his support for him “was never based upon shared values.” Johnnie Moore
Johnnie Moore, an author and national spokesman for My Faith Votes, told CNN he would still vote for Trump, even though he is “disgusted” by his comments.
“Most conservative evangelicals who are voting for Trump have never been under the illusion that Trump has a puritan past. They are more concerned about the present and whether or not he is more likely than Hillary Clinton to protect their religious liberty, appoint conservative judges and protect the life of the unborn.”
Moore also insisted that his vote is not the same as an endorsement.
“I wasn’t on board with Donald Trump to begin with. None of us were asked to endorse him, we were only asked to provide advice and perspective on certain issues. I agreed to serve because of my concern for refugees and for persecuted Christians around the world.”
UPDATE: Moore also sent an email to ThinkProgress, explaining that he never endorsed Trump in the first place. He did not mention his voting intentions.
“Of course, I absolutely condemn the awful comments he made a decade ago. They were repugnant,” he said in the email. “I also haven’t endorsed him, and so I wouldn’t defend him to begin with. I was_—_and remain_—_more than willing to serve on his faith advisory council because of my personal concern for all refugees (including Muslims) and my extensive advocacy on behalf of persecuted Christians around the world.”
He also noted that he’d be willing to serve on a board with Clinton, should she invite him.
“As a staunchly pro-life and pro-refugee evangelical, I disagree with both candidates on several issues,” he said. “I believe in dialogue, not partisanship, and especially having dialogue with those different than you. By the way, in my personal interaction with Mr. Trump, I’ve seen no hint of that behavior, and_—_so far_—_I’ve never had the privilege of interacting with Sec. Clinton.”
“I’m also not that concerned with criticism or my reputation, to be honest,” Moore added. “I remember that moment in the Gospel of Matthew when someone asked Jesus, ‘why does your teacher eat with such people?’ I’m happy to be accused of such by the left and by the right. We’re never going to get anywhere in this country unless we start talking to each other again.”
Mark Burns
After Trump released his video apologizing for his remarks, Rev. Burns tweeted the clip with a 2 Corinthians reference to scripture that states “old things are passed away” in Christ.
 (Rev. Burns, once a prominent surrogate for Trump, has since largely removed himself from the spotlight after it was revealed by CNN that he was embellishing his record, accomplishments, and degrees.)

100440,1010,More than ‘locker room banter’: Women say Trump sexually assaulted them,https://thinkprogress.org/trump-sexual-assaults-dcdec45b9d64#.4mcgiheyp,16,"After initially writing off the leaked video of him describing sexually assaulting women in 2005 as “locker room banter,” Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump released a longer video apologizing early Saturday morning.
“Anyone who knows me, know these words don’t reflect who I am,” he said. “This is nothing more than a distraction from the important issues we are facing today.”
“There’s a big difference between words and actions,” he continued. But it isn’t just Trump’s words that paint a picture of him subjecting women to unwanted sexual contact. Other women have described experiencing the very behavior Trump described in the video, with one going so far as to file a lawsuit against him.
In the video obtained by the Washington Post, Trump can be heard eating Tic Tacs and saying, “I’m automatically attracted to beautiful_—_I just start kissing them, it’s like a magnet. Just kiss. I don’t even wait.”
That lines up with a story Temple Taggart, a Miss USA contestant in 1997, told the New York Times earlier this year. Donald Trump had recently bought the Miss Universe franchise, and Taggart said that when he introduced himself to her for the very first time he came up to her and kissed her directly on the lips.
“I thought, ‘Oh my god, gross,’” she said. “I think there were a few other girls that he kissed on the mouth. I was like ‘Wow, that’s inappropriate.’”
Another unnamed woman has given a written statement to CNN host Erin Burnett describing her own similar encounter with Trump. “The Tic Tacs, that’s exactly what Trump did to me,” she wrote. “Trump took Tic Tacs, suggested I take them also. He then leaned in, catching me off guard, and kissed me almost on the lips. I was really freaked out.”
She said he later asked her to come into his office alone and told her to call him, but she “ran the hell out of there.”
Trump continued in the 2005 video, “When you’re a star, [women] let you do it. You can do anything. Grab them by the pussy. You can do anything.”
That’s what Jill Harth has said she experienced when she worked with Trump in the early 1990s. She and her then-fiancé George Houraney, who was her business partner, were working with Trump on a beauty pageant. But at their first meeting in 1992, Harth said in a complaint she filed against Trump in 1997, he started making sexual overtures toward her and then put his hands on her thighs and genitals under the table.
Then in 1993 Harth’s complaint said that after the end of a business meeting at Mar-a-Lago, Trump forcibly brought her to a bedroom and assaulted her, touching her genitals and attempting to rape her.
“He pushed me up against the wall, and had his hands all over me and tried to get up my dress again,” she told The Guardian in July.
“It was unwanted and aggressive, very sexually aggressive,” she told WNYC in August.
Trump may have dismissed his discussion of sexual assault as a distraction, but Harth says it took a serious toll on her.
“Let me just say, this was a very traumatic thing working for him,” she said in her testimony while the lawsuit was ongoing. She told The Guardian, “It was stressful, it gave me anxiety, it definitely wounded my marriage_—_it wasn’t the death knell, but it wounded it, it was stressful having to handle this.”
She eventually withdrew her case as a condition of a settlement Trump reached with Houraney over a separate lawsuit alleging breach of contract. Trump has consistently denied Harth’s account, saying it lacks “any merit or veracity.” "
100441,1010,The most outrageous defenses of Trump’s comments about assaulting women,https://thinkprogress.org/trump-assault-excuses-c15054816f7f#.9huv6j7i2,16,"After the Washington Post published a video of Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump discussing kissing and groping women without their consent, some of his backers expressed their outrage, while others even withdrew their support.
But some instead decided to come to his defense, offering up a wide range of excuses for the remarks admitting to sexual assault.
Just raunchy talk
One group wrote the comments off as harmless banter.
Former Trump campaign manager and CNN commentator Corey Lewandowski dismissed the tape’s importance because, “We are electing a leader to the free world, we’re not electing a Sunday school teacher.”
On MSNBC, Michele Bachmann, former member of Congress, called Trump’s comments “bad boy talk.”
And the chair of Trump’s Virginia campaign who is also running for governor responded to his candidate’s comments by saying Trump “acted like a frat boy, as a lot of guys do,” adding that people already “knew he wasn’t an angel.”
The co-chair of Trump’s campaign in New York, Carl Paladino, said Trump’s comments were something “ all men do, at least all normal men.”
We all sin
Another group came to his defense by saying we’re all sinners.
When asked for former Republican candidate Ben Carson’s reaction, spokesman Armstrong Williams told BuzzFeed, “People commit adultery. It happens. Ministers. Heads of state. Everyday people. People are human, they do human things. It’s nothing unusual that somebody committed adultery on their spouse. Women do it. Men do it. Should we be shocked by it? No… Hey, the flesh can be weak, my man.”
Sean Hannity, Fox News host, seemed to echo that defense, saying, “King David Had 500 concubines for crying out loud.” Then others came up with more creative excuses.
Washington State Republican Party Chairwoman Susan Hutchison argued that they shouldn’t matter now because they “were made when he was a Democrat.”
And Fox host Bill O’Reilly pointed out that the comments were in a “private conversation.” "
100442,1001,Red alert! Trumpocalypse approaching: Severe and increasing risk of Republican destruction!,http://www.dailykos.com/stories/2016/10/8/1579578/-Red-alert-Trumpocalypse-approaching-Severe-and-increasing-risk-of-Republican-destruction,17,"The nightmare that is a strengthening Trumpocalypse is bearing down on the ever-so-deserving Republican Party today, with events escalating rapidly.

Republicans are demoralized, desperately looking for an escape hatch. Enthusiasm is down, as they turn on their own. The RNC is no longer supporting the Trump campaign, while Trump himself has gone all-caps to assure us he’s never gonna give up his death grip on the party. It’s official, folks: We’ve upgraded to a Category IV Trumpocalypse within the last 24 hours.

And the Trump disaster is gaining steam: We’re already meeting the first criteria for a Category V event, Trumpageddon:

“Most elected Republicans withdraw Trump endorsements, but to little avail.”
The New York Times has a handy timeline of which Republicans are not supporting Trump, and when they announced. The list starts with those who saw him for what he was months ago and were willing to say so, and continues on to today’s announcements from those who were just dandy with his prior shit-stirring comments of hatred but couldn’t abide Friday’s particular revelations.

Watch this list carefully. Campaign Trump will pass through treacherous territory Sunday night at the debate; another blow-up could spark a mass exodus of Republican support that dwarfs what we’ve already seen, putting us well on the way to another upgrade.

What would that mean? 400 electoral votes, a Democratic Senate, a Supreme Court made whole, and maybe, juuuust maybe … a return of Speaker Pelosi."
100443,1001,Reports: Priebus telling Republican staffers to do 'what's best' for them as Trump implodes,http://www.dailykos.com/stories/2016/10/9/1579895/-Reports-Priebus-telling-Republican-staffers-to-do-what-s-best-for-them-as-Trump-implodes,17,"Republican National Committee Chair Reince Priebus has always had something the aspect of a rat, and now he’s apparently found his sinking ship:

According to a source within the RNC, Priebus is telling staffers to do ""what's best"" for them as aides at every level fear working on the Trump campaign's behalf could damage their reputation. Adding to their concern is the possibility more damaging footage of Trump might emerge.
RNC spokesman Sean Spicer denied those reports, but of course he would.

This should nicely feed Trump's rage against Republicans for abandoning him. And the rest of us can continue to marvel at all the stuff that didn’t make these very same Republicans abandon Trump, before they finally discovered their principles fear of future career damage.

As of 11:30 PM, an hour after the debate, Trump led with 89.76 percent of the vote compared to 10.24 percent for Hillary Clinton.

97,513 voters felt Trump won the debate against 11,120 for Clinton.

The numbers have held consistent.

As of 10:55 PM, 25 minutes after the debate’s scheduled end, Trump was winning the Drudge poll with 89.56 percent support, compared to 10.44 percent for Hillary Clinton.

The Trump campaign is excited about the way the debate went. Trump campaign manager Kellyanne Conway admitted that while Clinton did well in the first debate, her second performance revealed her true personality and temperament."
100445,1002,"Fact-Check: Yes, the United States Has ‘Just About the Highest’ Corporate Taxes in the World",http://www.breitbart.com/live/second-presidential-debate-fact-check-livewire/fact-check-yes-united-states-just-highest-corporate-taxes-world/,17,"During the second presidential debate, Donald Trump said the United States has among the highest taxes in the world, and it’s hindering our economic growth.
Fact-Check: MOSTLY TRUE

Trump said the following:

We are going to be thriving again. We have no growth in this country. If China has a GDP of 7 percent, it’s like a national catastrophe. We’re down to 1 percent. And that’s like no growth. We’re going lower in my opinion. And a lot of it has to do with the fact that our taxes are so high. Just about the highest in the world. And I’m bringing them down to one of the lower in the world. And I think it’s so important, one of the most important things we can do. But she is raising everybody’s taxes massively.

“She,” of course, refers to Hillary Clinton. Trump was speaking in the context of his own plan to lower taxes to spur economic growth, versus Clinton’s plan to raise taxes.

Trump said U.S. GDP growth is “down to 1 percent.” In fact, GDP growth was originally reported as 1.1 percent for the second quarter of 2016, and later revised up to 1.4 percent. Trump’s statement is very close to the original number, and only a bit of an overstatement for the revised number.

As for Trump’s assessment of the U.S. as having “just about the highest” taxes in the world, he did leave himself a bit of wiggle room by saying “just about.” More importantly, to assess the truth of his statement, we must consider which taxes he’s talking about.

There are numerous countries with higher income tax rates – America is not even Top 10 on that score. But U.S. does have one of the highest corporate tax rates in the world – currently the third highest, behind the United Arab Emirates and Puerto Rico. Given Puerto Rico’s unique status, it would be fair to say the United States has the second highest tax rate of any nation.

America’s top marginal corporate tax rate is 35%, while the world average is only 22.5%, and the European average is about 19%. Trump wants to dramatically reduce the U.S. rate to 15%.

Given the context of his remarks, it seems fair to assume he was talking about corporate tax rates when he said America’s were among the highest in the world, although he did not explicitly state that."
100446,1002,Donald Trump Wins Second Debate; CNN Says It Doesn’t Matter,http://www.breitbart.com/big-government/2016/10/09/debate-donald-trump-wins-second-presidential-media-say-doesnt-matter/,17,"Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump was the winner of Sunday night’s second presidential debate at Washington University in St. Louis. However, media commentators denied Trump the outright win, or said it would not matter.
CNN’s Jake Tapper, for one, said tt the debate was a “wash.” His colleague, Gloria Borger, said: “He may have done enough to stop the bleeding. I’m not sure any minds were changed at this debate tonight. I think so much has occurred over the last 48 hours and this last week that people have to digest all of this, including the debate tonight, to see where they stand.” Co-panelist Mike Smerconish declared Trump the winner “on points”: “I think the night belongs to Donald Trump,” he said. But Smerconish added that Trump had fallen short, regardless: “Did he grow the tent? I can’t see that there was any outreach.”

Trump beat Clinton despite facing a three-on-one press from his opponent and from the moderators, who were at least as biased as they had been in any of the previous debates. CNN’s Anderson Cooper fired repeated follow-ups at Trump while leaving Clinton largely alone. But he, at least, brought up tough questions for Clinton on occasion. ABC News’ Martha Raddatz actively debated Trump at times, and silenced the audience when it cheered for Trump — though not for Clinton.

Still, Trump overcame that hostility and pressed Clinton effectively on the issues, as well as on her weakest points — the email scandal, Benghazi, and Obamacare. He was on better ground than Clinton when it came to citing facts, and he forced her into repeating the rather serious lie that the only emails she deleted from her private server were personal in nature. He also stood his ground on substantive policy questions while maintaining his cool — for the most part — when she tried personal attacks.

The media had largely declared the presidential race for Hillary Clinton Saturday, after many Republicans criticized Trump over comments he made in 2005 about groping women. The comments were captured by a live mic and surfaced Friday. Chuck Todd, political director of NBC News, said “the presidential race is over,” according to Republicans with whom he spoke. Despite Trump’s debate win, the media will be reluctant to let go of that narrative, with many cheering for his demise.

At the first debate, Trump refrained from placing any of the women who have accused Bill Clinton of sexual impropriety in the front row, despite threatening to do so. This time, with the media and the Hillary Clinton campaign hitting Trump over his old remarks, Trump more than delivered on the threat, holding a press conference with four of Bill Clinton’s accusers — who also accused Hillary Clinton of trying to silence and slander them — before the debate, and placing them in the front row.

The Donald Trump that debated Hillary Clinton in St. Louis was better prepared, more passionate, and more focused on the issues than he was two weeks ago. He won, under incredible pressure.

The voters will see it, even if the media will not."
100447,1003,"Brig. Gen. Donald C. Bolduc — The Real Donald, The Real Tough Guy",http://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/brig-gen-donald-c-bolduc-the-real-donald-the_us_57fac8e2e4b0d786aa52b6ce?utm_hp_ref=politics,17,"Donald Trump likes to be hailed as the Donald, but the only thing definite about him, besides his hatred, pathological lying, stupidity and sadism, is that he is a fraud as a man and a fraud as a tough guy.

He likes to surround himself with people like Bob Knight, the former Army, Indiana University and Olympic basketball coach, and Mike Tyson, the former heavyweight boxing champion, but Donald Trump is not and never has been a warrior or a fighter for anything except his own preening, solipsistic needs for trumpeting his name, extending his 15 minutes of infamy and gaining contracts so that he can build shrines to the Trump brand all over the world.

Trump’s fraudulence, to say nothing of his sadism, has never been more apparent than when he denigrates the health of other people.

By now the list is pretty familiar, so here are just a few highlights:

He mocked Serge F. Kovaleski, a New York Times reporter with a disability, a rare congenital disorder that affects, among other things, his ability to use his hand.

He ridiculed Hillary Clinton for stumbling as she got onto a van when she had pneumonia.

And he questioned whether or not our troops are tough enough if they “can’t handle” life when they come back to this country after serving in combat.

Of course, as I have written before, Trump himself got a medical deferment, as well as four academic deferments, which allowed him to duck the Vietnam War.

Yet he had the gall to cast doubt on whether John McCain, who was a prisoner of war in Vietnam for some five years, was a true war hero.

With all that in mind, I was thrilled to see that the New York Times ran a story this weekend, a Saturday profile, in which its reporter, Dionne Searcey, wrote about Brig. Gen. Donald C. Bolduc, who has served eight, eight!, tours in a war zone and who is a leading advocate on behalf of troops with PTSD.

As Searcey wrote, General Bolduc, a Green Beret, has endured countless traumas on the battlefield, including a helicopter crash and the detonation of a 2,000-pound bomb right by him.

The signs of his trauma have included headaches, lack of balance while walking, insomnia, undoubtedly nightmares, and a “bullet-sized spot on his brain.”

According to Searcey, it took General Bolduc 12 years from the first signs of his trauma to seek help for his PTSD.

Now, the combat veteran, who leads our Special Operations Forces in Africa, “has become an evangelist for letting soldiers know that it is all right to get help for brain injuries and mental health problems.”

As Searcey wrote, one of Bolduc’s missions is to convince soldiers that there is nothing weak about having a mental illness, such as PTSD or depression, and that there is nothing weak about seeking help for such an illness or injury.

I could not agree more.

Through my own articles and speeches, I have been trying to de-stigmatize mental illness for more than a decade, and I have written over the years about the need to support our troops with mental-health and other resources, particularly when they come back from a combat deployment.

In a piece I wrote for the Huffington Post in 2010, titled “Macho Men Get Depressed, Too,” I noted that tough guys from Terry Bradshaw, the Hall of Fame quarterback for the Pittsburgh Steelers, to Winston Churchill, a combat veteran and wartime leader of Great Britain, have suffered from depression.

I pointed out that the high rate of suicides in our military required us to acknowledge the problems of PTSD and depression among our troops, and, at minimum, to send condolence letters to the families of those who have taken their lives.

Of course, the best solution of all is to eliminate the stigma of mental illness and brain injuries, so that our troops seek treatment well before they become suicidal.

Most military suicides occur not in combat but when servicemen and women are back in the United States, when they lack the camaraderie of being in a unit, when some of them no longer feel that they have a sense of purpose in their lives.

General Bolduc is a true American hero, not only because he has served eight tours in combat; he is a true hero to the planet because he is proving that those who grapple with mental illness, whether they are in a combat zone or not, whether they have served in the military or not, should not be viewed as weak, lazy, incompetent or any other negative stereotype out there.

Many people with mental illness have historically been afraid to speak up because of bullies like Donald Trump, who a few years ago castigated President Obama as a “psycho” for his handling of the Ebola crisis.

I know that it is beyond the intellect of Trump, an ignorant man, to recognize the difference between psychosis, a treatable medical condition, from which I have suffered and which entails hallucinations and delusions; and psychopathy, a lack of remorse for the planning and commission of violent acts.

Whatever word or meaning Trump intended, he used the term, “psycho,” to demean, insult and tar President Obama, a healthy man, with a diagnosis that he does not have.

Thankfully, General Bolduc has demonstrated that even if a leader has a diagnosis, like PTSD or depression or psychosis, he or she should not fear coming forward and seeking treatment.

Kudos to the New York Times for running this profile, and kudos to General Bolduc for showing what it means to be a real human being, a real mensch, a real hero, and, yes, the real Donald."
100448,1003,"Politics, Sex and Religion: Voters Virtual Gospel Lesson by Jesus, “Woe Hypocrites”",http://www.huffingtonpost.com/noel-irwin-hentschel/politics-sex-and-religion_b_12420968.html?utm_hp_ref=politics,17,"We are all sinners. “He that is without sin among you, let him first cast a stone.” The key to salvation is repentance and desire to no longer offend God and do good works. In this inflammable election year of Divine Mercy, Jesus reminds us in the Gospel of St. John when the Pharisees were stoning the adulteress that they better consider their own sins and reconciliation with God before condemning others to death. Redemption is a gift of grace from God for all humanity. It was bought for us by Jesus’ sacrifice on the Cross. It’s interesting to consider that God is a much more forgiving and compassionate Father than His stubborn children. It is human nature to see the flaws and vices of others, but Jesus teaches that when we focus on developing our own virtues we actually have a more profound effect on change than does condemnation for indescretions. We are taught to not turn a blind eye to bad behavior but it is right and just to forgive without condoning.

In the case of Donald Trump, there is a deliberate attempt to distract from the disturbing ongoing revelations of national security breaches of his opponent. Trump although a repentant sinner is being judged, condemned and sent to execution by those with an anti-change agenda led by the main stream media with help from the hypocritical political establishment and Hollywood Hillary supporters. These three influential forces, desiring status quo for self-interest have joined together to be the prosecutor, judge and executor to try to eliminate the fear of change that Trump-Pence represents. Trouble is that the status quo candidate Hillary Clinton is more flawed and dangerous to America’s future. This is the growing view of nearly half of America’s voters according to recent polls. CEO Trump and Governor Pence have the vision and joint leadership skills to make a positive difference for all Americans.

One could liken this political firestorm to an analogy of the Cross. Calvary was in some ways like two sides of a debate leading to a winner, a loser and a big prize. At Calvary the criminal tied to a cross on one side of Jesus taunted Him by arrogantly proclaiming that if He was so powerful why doesn’t He just let the unrepentant thief go free and get the reward. But it was the repentant sinner on the other side of Jesus who admitted his guilt and accepted responsibility that received salvation and reward. “This day you shall be with me in Paradise” is promised by Jesus to all who have a contrite heart and desire for change to be better. Trump humbly apologized to all American people, admitting he has been changed by the many good Americans he has come to know and he promised to do better. You can’t ask for more than that.

When considering the choice voters have for the future of America and welfare of their families, the decision comes down to choosing between two very different leadership teams, Trump-Pence or Clinton-Kaine. One team with a sincere change attitude, the other with a status-quo, “deny, deny, deny” mentality. Who do you believe has the right intention, the energy and the willingness to fight the political DC establishment, global elite and terrorism enemies? Who will make the necessary changes for economic development, job growth and better security for a safer nation? Who will serve and defend the American people? Consciences will need to weigh which is more harmful, the candidate with past reality show foul mouth incidents versus the lying tongue from one mother to another whose beloved son and other innocent Americans would have been saved in Benghazi had she truly cared about those she was given the leadership role and duty to protect by the American people. She had her chance. She failed. That’s a fact. That’s the reality vote factor."
100449,1003,How Trump Could Delegitimize Clinton’s Presidency,http://www.huffingtonpost.com/jeff-jarvis/how-trump-could-delegitim_b_12419530.html?utm_hp_ref=politics,17,"I can hear it now, starting on Nov. 9:

“Hillary Clinton isn’t really the President. She got elected only because she ran against Donald Trump, the worst candidate in history. She didn’t destroy him; he destroyed himself. Nobody wanted to vote for her. They had to vote for her.”

This is a direct extension of the media narrative we hear now about Clinton: that no one trusts her, no one likes her. That is a media lie, a manipulation and the result of lazy journalism. When was the last time you heard the voices of the millions of enthusiastic Clinton voters reflected in media? This is how media will be accessories to the Trump, alt right, and GOP crime of attempting to delegitimize another American Presidency.

Media already began the process by abnormalizing Clinton. You’ve heard this:

“Yes, Donald Trump is a misogynist and has admitted committing sexual assault and he is a bigot who has attacked Mexicans as rapists and murderers and Muslims as terrorists and he has defamed African-American communities as hells ruled by crime and drug-dealing. But in our next segment, we will tell you for the thousandth time about Hillary Clinton’s emails.

“Yes, Donald Trump’s foundation is a sham that he uses to settle his personal debts and enrich his ego, and he defaults on his promises to charities and causes. But when we come back, we will cast aspersions on Hillary and Bill Clinton’s foundation, even though we have no journalistic evidence of wrongdoing, even though the Clinton foundation does immense good work saving lives and helping people, and even though we in media won’t tell you about all that good work.

“Because balance.”

Of course, at the same time, media normalized Donald Trump, giving him attention that was wildly disproportionate to his popularity at the beginning of the campaign_—_making his campaign a reality_—_and later refusing to call ignorant ignorant and evil evil. NPR won’t call Trump a liar because that is a “volatile“ word. Media fell over itself praising The New York Times for calling his lies lies; why did we not expect that all along? Media knew he was a misogynist, a sexist pig, yet they had to wait for the Clinton campaign to do their reporting for them to break into their narrative with incidents that told the story. Media have seen his racism again and again but refuse to call him a bigot. That, too, would be too volatile.

So in their effort to find balance_—_as Jay Rosen points out, in their effort to cope with the asymmetry of this campaign (and years of political imbalance leading up to this)_—_media raised up Donald Trump to the nearest definition of normal they could muster and they pulled Hillary Clinton down to as near as his level of mistrust and mendacity as they could get away with because that serves the dynamics that drive their business: conflict and suspense.

And along the way, I keep hearing media doing the democratically irresponsible: suppressing voter turnout by predicting it. (That supports their narrative: Nobody trust, likes, or cares.) And now leaders of the GOP are giving their own reprehensible civics lesson: At last, at long last, some of them are repudiating Donald Trump_—_not because he has been a racist to Latinos, Muslims, and African-Americans, not because he is a misogynist, not because he lies, not because he is ignorant, not because he is dangerous, but because he finally crossed the White Woman Line. Yet those same politicians now legitimize the idea of not voting for president. That also delegitimizes the victor, Hillary Clinton. You’ll hear this, too:

“Well, we didn’t vote for her. We didn’t have anyone to vote for. So we’re not going to work with her. We’re going to continue what we’ve done for a generation: only working against her, only blocking anything she proposes to do. For we will never let her win, not the White House, not a single battle, not so much as a bill.”

This is why it is critical that we defeat not only Donald Trump but also the party that put him where he is and the politicians who were his accessories. Every politician who supported him_ — _no matter whether that support is now withdrawn_ — _has the stench of Trump and the alt right on them and that cannot be washed away with a press release and a tweet. The party that fertilized the fetid ground that spawned Trump with its years of insurgent obstruction must be held to account for not caring to defend Latinos, Muslims, and blacks, let alone our military — and responsible government_ — _but only white women.

We do need balance in a democracy or else there can be no dialog and legitimacy of negotiated compromise. We need for conservatives to be represented in the political process and heard in media. We need a new conservative movement to rise from the ashes of the fire that not just Trump but a generation of GOP leaders and right-wing media set. We on the left should support the rebuilding of a responsible, loyal opposition. I am writing another post with a call to build responsible conservative media as well, to fill the vacuum that liberal_ — _yes, liberal_ — _media left, which was exploited by political movements masquerading as media: Fox News (now 20 years ago_ — _everything I lament here is the fruit of their labor) and its foster children Breitbart and Drudge.

Consider this: In losing, Trump the disgusting movement behind him will win. Their goal is to bring down institutions and they have already succeeded. They have destroyed the Republican Party. They will continue to delegitimize the Democratic Party and its victory. They will thus delegitimize government. They have lowered the quality of political discourse in this country to their level. Yes, they have won.

That is why it is so vital that we take back our victory from them. That is why I am going to Pennsylvania every chance I get to register voters. That is why you must vote and push every sane and civilized family member, friend, neighbor, and coworker to vote. That is why every fellow Hillary Clinton supporter out there must loudly proclaim her or his support. That is why we must defeat every politician who cynically supported Trump_ — _whether or not they then cynically withdrew that support. That is why we must recapture the American dream from the Trump nightmare.

My friend Rafat Ali_ — _an immigrant, an entrepreneur, an American citizen, a voter_ — _just posted this quote by Bertolt Brecht from The Resistible Rise of Arturo Ui (1941):

Do not rejoice in his defeat, you men. For though the world has stood up and stopped the bastard, the bitch that bore him is in heat again.
Rejoice in her victory. But do not allow the bastard’s fathers to snatch victory from their defeat."

After a tape surfaced Friday of Trump describing how he kissed women even if they didn't care to be kissed, how he grabbed them by the p***y, the mood had substantially changed in the election. Republicans had disavowed Trump and there had been a lot of speculation about whether the candidates would shake hands, per tradition.

They did not."
100451,1004,Trump Pivots To ISIS When Asked About His Predatory Comments About Women,http://talkingpointsmemo.com/livewire/donald-trump-second-debate-sexual-assault-comments-locker-room-talk,17,"Asked to answer for his comments boasting about kissing and groping women during the second presidential debate on Sunday, Donald Trump dismissed it as “locker room talk” before pivoting to a discussion about defeating the Islamic State terror group.

CNN’s Anderson Cooper first pointed out that Trump did not answer the first question from an audience member about whether he was modeling appropriate behavior for today’s youth, before bringing up the leaked 2005 “Access Hollywood” tape in which Trump talked about groping women.

“We received a lot of questions about the tape released on Friday,” Cooper said. “You called what you said locker room banter, kissing women without consent, grabbing their genitals. That is sexual assault. You bragged that you have sexually assaulted women.”

“I don't think you understood,” Trump replied, using language similar to what his campaign said shortly after the tape was published. “This was locker room talk. I'm not proud of it. I apologized to my family. To the American people. Certainly I'm not proud of it. But this is locker room talk. When we have a world where you have ISIS chopping off heads, where you have frankly drowning people in steel cages, wars and horrible, horrible sights all over, so many bad things happening. We haven't seen anything like this. The carnage all over the world.”

“I'm very embarrassed by it,” the Republican nominee went on. “I hate it. But it's locker room talk and it's one of those things. I will knock the hell out of Isis. We're going to defeat ISIS.”

Cooper pushed him to answer whether he has actually grabbed women by their genitals as he bragged about doing.

“I have great respect for women,” Trump said. “Nobody has more respect for women than I do.”

“So you're saying you never did that?” Cooper asked.

“No, I have not. I will tell you, that I'm going the make our country safe. We're going to have borders in our country, which we don't know. People are pouring into our country and coming in from the middle east another places. We're going to make America safe again. Make America great again, but safe again. And we're going to make America wealthy again.”

Hillary Clinton looked on sternly as Trump answered Cooper’s questions.

Many prominent Republicans have called for Trump to drop out and withdrawn their support over the tape."
100452,1004,Trump To Clinton: You Started Birtherism And Owe Obama An Apology!,http://talkingpointsmemo.com/livewire/trump-says-clinton-owes-the-president-an-apology-for-birtherism-he-pushed,17,"Donald Trump responded to Hillary Clinton's demand at Sunday's presidential that he apologize for his birther campaign against President Obama by falsely accusing her 2008 campaign of starting the rumor.

""Well, you owe the president an apology because as, you know very well, your campaign Sidney Blumenthal, he's another real winner that you have, and he's the one that got this started along with your campaign manager and they were on television just two weeks ago, she was, saying exactly that,"" Trump said.

The campaign manager he referred to, Patti Solis Doyle, said that a campaign volunteer forwarded an email suggesting Obama was Muslim and was promptly fired. Blumenthal meanwhile was accused by a McClatchy journalist of urging his team to look into the rumors, but the journalist has not produced any emails proving as such and Blumenthal has denied the claim.

""You owe him an apology and sent the pictures around your campaign, sent the pictures with President Obama in a certain garb long, that was before I was ever involved,"" Trump said. ""So, you actually owe an apology."""
100453,1005,"Before Republicans Ran from Donald Trump, They Let Him Win the Nomination",http://www.motherjones.com/politics/2016/10/republicans-ran-donald-trump-they-let-him-win-nomination,17,"Republican politicians began abandoning Donald Trump in droves Saturday, just hours after an unearthed video from 2005 revealed the Republican nominee crudely bragging about what amounted to sexual assault. After months of demurring while Trump's offensive comments piled up, dozens of leaders are finally walking away from their party's nominee. Now, many say they can't support him. Some are even urging the party to deploy some sort of last-minute maneuver to remove Trump from the GOP ticket.

But as the party engages in a collective weekend meltdown, it's important to remember that Trump's nomination wasn't inevitable. There's no doubt that Trump tapped into an anti-establishment, grassroots fervor that helped him win the nomination. But there was a monthslong slog, during which time Republicans—many of whom are now denouncing him—could have have put up a fight against him. When Trump effectively clinched the nomination by winning the Indiana primary on May 3, the Republican establishment had barely lifted a finger to deprive him of the nomination.

Even before Friday's revelations by the Washington Post, anti-Trump Republican strategists were expressing dismay at how easy it had become for Trump to take over the entire party.

""I was extremely surprised by how easy people rolled over for him,"" Tim Miller, a Republican in the Never-Trump camp, told Mother Jones in an interview shortly before the 2005 video was released Friday afternoon. ""I never could have imagined, even as late as last year, that the establishment of the Republican Party in Washington would just completely roll over for Trump and there would be minimal objection to his nomination. It just blew me away that there were not mass resignations or very visible objections.""

""There was still plenty of time to slow down Trump and to stop Trump,"" Miller said.
Miller, an alum of the Republican National Committee, worked as Jeb Bush's communications director. When Bush dropped out of the primary after the South Carolina primary on February 20, Miller went to work for Our Principles PAC, an anti-Trump effort funded largely by billionaires Joe and Marlene Ricketts.

""There was still plenty of time to slow down Trump and to stop Trump,"" Miller recalled. He said the super-PAC tried to get Republicans leaders in upcoming primary states to object to Trump, from governors, congressmen, and senators to retired politicians and conservative pundits. His group had almost no luck.

""You know, this was doable,"" Miller said. ""And because a lot of politicians did not want to take the risk, because a lot of them did not feel like Ted Cruz was that much better—which was BS—nobody stuck their neck out there. And I, you know, I can't believe it.""

It wasn't only Republican officials who refused to stick their necks out; neither did more than a handful of Republican donors. ""The Ricketts, to their credit, stuck their neck out on this and created this PAC,"" Miller said. ""After Jeb dropped out there were a few other donors who got on board. But it was a small number of donors who were carrying a big load on this, for sure.""  

In the end, even that wasn't enough. The Ricketts later switched sides and gave $1 million to a super-PAC supporting Trump.

Of course, Trump hasn't changed in the months since he was just one of 17 candidates. Back then, he was still a birther with a history of misogynist behavior (which he continued during the campaign), spreading fear toward immigrants and Muslims. And yet, as Miller put it, the establishment just ""rolled over for him."""
100454,1006,Shocker: emails reveal “cozy” relationship between Clinton campaign and press,http://hotair.com/archives/2016/10/09/shocker-emails-reveal-cozy-relationship-clinton-campaign-press/,17,"Here’s some inside baseball material which highlights a serious disconnect in the perception of relations between the Clinton campaign and the media. Hillary Clinton is notoriously reclusive with the press, frequently finding herself on the receiving end of complaints about how few pressers she holds and her general lack of availability. That stands in contrast with the massively favorable coverage she receives – or at least the inordinate amount of silence surrounding negative Clinton stories compared to the media’s treatment of trump.

But why would she avoid them so much when they seem to be willing to provide favorable coverage? Writing at The Intercept, Glenn Greenwald reveals some new emails from Guccifer 2.0 which highlight the Clinton team’s awareness of who is or is not friendly in the press corps. In their leading example they cite the staff’s eagerness to work with former Politico reporter (now with the New York Times) Maggie Haberman.

At times, Clinton’s campaign staff not only internally drafted the stories they wanted published but even specified what should be quoted “on background” and what should be described as “on the record.”

One January 2015 strategy document – designed to plant stories on Clinton’s decision-making process about whether to run for president – singled out reporter Maggie Haberman, then of Politico, now covering the election for the New York Times, as a “friendly journalist” who has “teed up” stories for them in the past and “never disappointed” them. Nick Merrill, the campaign press secretary, produced the memo, according to the document metadata:
How specific were the marching orders for contacting reporters like Haberman? Pretty explicit. It’s worth keeping in mind here that these are things which communications folks in every campaign want to do. It’s something they all try to do. The real question is how effective they are and how accomodating the media is willing to be. In this case it seemed to be a fairly effective relationship. As Glenn goes on to note, Haberman published two stories on Clinton’s vetting process. While they might not have been word for word what the campaign was looking for, the outlet was clearly pushing the desired theme of Clinton’s thoroughness and good management.

It wasn’t just the print media being shown favoritism. Greenwald lists a number of Clinton “surrogates” appearing on cable news outlets who could be directly contacted with talking points to push. Some of them were “on the payroll” in various capacities without disclosing that to viewers. A few of the big names on that list include CNN’s Hilary Rosen and Donna Brazile as well as Stephanie Cutter and Maria Cardona. It’s obviously no mystery that these expert commentators were there to promote the Democrats, but their close relationship with the Clinton campaign was never explicitly revealed.

Is any of this a shock? Probably not if you’ve watched cable news for more than five minutes or ever seen a newspaper. But it’s still fascinating to see it set forth in black and white this way. Check out the full article for more details."
100455,1006,How Trump’s detractors may have sabotaged their own October Surprise,http://hotair.com/archives/2016/10/09/trumps-detractors-may-sabotaged-october-surprise/,17,"Heading into tonight’s debates the theme for the evening has already been set by the media, along with everyone else who has been hoping that a giant sinkhole would open up and swallow Donald Trump like some sort of low rent Mothra in a budget Godzilla film. This narrative rests on the assumption that the video of Trump’s now infamous Bus Ride with Billy was the straw that broke the camel’s back and “everyone is fleeing the sinking ship.” Over at The Hill they’re keeping a running WHIP list of politicians who are pulling their support for the nominee. Less mentioned is the fact that these are mostly people who opposed Trump from the beginning and only came onboard when he began exceeding expectations in the polls.

So are these The End Days which everyone has been predicting? I wouldn’t be quite so hasty in nailing the coffin shut. Once the initial shock and awe has worn off you may find that those seeking to undermine Trump’s campaign have badly misplayed what could have been a winning hand. If the cable news authorities were going to quote any classic rock lyrics to script this moment it would be Jim Morrison singing about how This Is The End. But while the video was certainly a damaging broadside to the Trump campaign, the way this was handled was very possibly bungled. What could have really been the end of the line for The Donald may have been fumbled to the point where he has a path to recovery. There are three factors which may support this idea that I’d like to cover.

First. Voters want to be informed but they are frequently tuned off by the perception of dirty tricks.

It doesn’t take a genius in political history to suspect that something smells funny with the timing of the release of this story. First there is the issue of how this latest outrage arrived on the stage. Since there clearly won’t be any admissions regarding how we really reached this point, voters are expected to stick with the current media explanation. The story goes that it showed up by happenstance when someone happened to discover the video on the “dusty shelves of NBC’s Access Hollywood archives.” (A show which has literally been on the air for twenty years.)

Let’s think about that explanation for a moment. We’ve undergone an arc of political history where:

Trump was seriously talking about running for President from the early winter of 2014 until June 2015
Trump officially enters the race in June of 2015 and campaigns, rising in the polls through the end of the year
In February of 2016 Trump takes second in one caucus, then goes on to win a string of victories where he’s the delegate leader through the spring
By June of 2016, he’s essentially locked up the nomination and his competition largely folds
By August the conventions have passed and Trump is the official nominee facing Hillary Clinton, though lagging in the polls a bit
By September Trump is rebounding the polls and is looking like a serious threat to win the election
Now we are expected to believe that only then, after nearly two years of Trump blossoming on the political stage, somebody at the sprawling behemoth of NBC Universal woke up from a nap during a staff meeting and said, “Hey. Wait a minute, now. Didn’t we have about a bazillion interviews with this Trump fellow on Access Hollywood and other celebrity related programming where he was saying all sorts of goofy and potentially damaging stuff? And didn’t he do the Stern show a million times and talk about all sorts of pornographic, filthy stuff about strippers and what have you? Do you think we still have any of that lying around? Maybe it’s worth taking a look!”

Returning to one of my favorite old sayings… pull the other one. It’s got bells on it.

Second. Timing is everything and the gun went off in Act I

There seems to be universal agreement among cable news spokesmodels that this is the beginning of the end. The video was The Worst Thing Ever and is surely the death of the campaign, but There Is More To Come. It’s all downhill from here.

But is it? I’ve no doubt there’s plenty more waiting to be sprung from the vaults by Hillary Clinton’s supporters. Access Hollywood and other sources are likely sitting on miles of tape, waiting to drop bombs at what they deem auspicious times to keep the conversation away from Hillary Clinton’s many debacles and Wikileaks revelations. But how much worse can the rest of them be?

Unless they’ve actually got The Donald on camera confessing to a triple homicide it’s tough to imagine the rest of the treasure trove being anything other than more variations of what we’ve just seen. Take for example this release from Andrew Kaczynski at CNN. It contains one audio clip after another, mostly from the Howard Stern Show. Plenty of it is bawdy and offensive. Some is downright gross. And it probably would have been considered shocking if we hadn’t just sat through 36 hours of hearing the p***y grabbing story over and over and over again. At this point the quips from Stern’s show about his own daughter “having a nice rack” are just more of the same, if not almost tame by comparison. If the people who have been plotting this scheme all along had been thinking clearly they would have started the car in first gear and worked their way up to drag racing speed before the final debate. They should have started with a clip of Trump saying it was okay to call his daughter “a piece of a**.” Then jump to just the admission of trying to have sex with a married woman. Finally you move to the p***y grabbing material in the home stretch.

As it stand now you’ve already shocked the world. Any additional garrulous speeches on women as sexual objects for men’s gratification is just more of the same at this point.

NARRATOR: Trump said Scandalous, Sexist, Repulsive Thing Number 1!
AUDIENCE: Oh My God! That’s terrible! How could he have been nominated!
NARRATOR: Trump said Scandalous, Sexist, Repulsive Thing Number 2!
AUDIENCE: Oh dear! That’s pretty bad too.
NARRATOR: Trump said Scandalous, Sexist, Repulsive Thing Number 3!
AUDIENCE: Yes. We know. We get it. Wasn’t there something on The Weather Channel about a hurricane?

You get the idea. On to the final point:

Third. You’ve set up Trump for the debate to the point where he’d almost have to try to fail to meet expectations

At this point, how much worse can it get? There is no doubt a “town hall participant” queued up to ask about the tape, assuming the format doesn’t allow for Anderson Cooper or his partner to do the deed themselves. Everyone knows the question already so there’s no gotcha factor. The only mystery is how he’ll answer. Will he go after Bill? That’s the expectation. If he does, he’s deemed to be taking cheap shots, but that’s what was predicted. But what if he doesn’t? What if, rather than going after Bill’s sexual escapades, he just says that it was a different time, that’s not how he sees women and he’s apologized. From there he launches into the recent email revelations about Hillary.

If he does that the conversation about the Billy Bush tape is pretty much done. If Hillary tries to keep bringing it up she comes off as a bitter scold. If the moderators keep banging away on it after Trump acknowledges it and moves on, they poison their own performance by looking like they’re in the tank for Hillary.If they allow multiple audience members to keep bringing it up the question selection bias is obvious and produces the same result.

Can Trump pull off that sort of play? I honestly don’t know, but I wouldn’t exclude the possibility. A lot of professional politicos have been left looking awfully silly after predicting that The Donald couldn’t navigate the minefield of American politics for the last two years. He may just surprise everyone yet again. And if he does, the page is turned we’re back in a serious dogfight for last four weeks. Anderson Cooper would be left with little choice other than to abandon this shiny plaything and hit some policy topics."

Party chairman Nicholas Sarwark sent the letter out late last night, telling Pence there was no path forward for Donald Trump to become president, but it doesn’t mean Hillary Clinton should get the Oval Office.

You and I may not agree on some other things but I know we can agree that Hillary Clinton also does not have the character appropriate to be the next President of the United States.

At this point, there is no path forward for Donald Trump to win this race. And, as I’m sure you are aware, it is too late to reprint ballots with any other name for the Republican ticket.

As Chairman of the Libertarian Party, I’m asking you to help us block Hillary Clinton from becoming President.

I am asking you to put your country ahead of your party by resigning from the Republican ticket and publicly endorsing Governor Gary Johnson for President.

Governor Gary Johnson is an experienced leader and a man of character. If elected, he will govern fairly and honestly. As you know, he has a track record of working across party lines and would continue this inclusiveness if elected President.

Governor Johnson’s name will be on every ballot in America. He is our best shot at getting a President that is qualified for the office, both in character and experience.

By endorsing Governor Johnson, you would show the country your commitment to character above party. By helping elect a man of integrity to the highest office in the land, you could very truly help save your country.

The stakes could not be higher. Please join me today in ensuring that Hillary Clinton does not become President.
It’s a pretty bold step to take by the Libertarians, and I don’t blame them at all. Yes, Trump and his supporters are “going to the mattresses,” and Odin only knows how bloody tonight’s debate is going to be. If Trump decides to go 100% populist for the last four weeks of the election, he could end up becoming the new George Wallace from 1968: winning a few states in the South and losing everywhere else. Does this mean the rest of the typically Republican states will go for Johnson over Clinton? No one really knows because it depends on early voting totals. Of course, Trump could also end up being the new Walter Mondale and get obliterated all across the country. It just depends on how angry voters are regarding #TrumpTape, and if all those politicians (and voters) publicly denouncing the tape will actually stay true to their word and not vote for Trump (if they weren’t already in the #NeverTrump camp).

This election is honestly starting to remind me a lot of the 2010 Colorado gubernatorial race. You had a kinda weak Democrat in John Hickenlooper being challenged by a businessman (and former cop) in Dan Maes. Once it leaked out Maes had lied about his background as a cop in Kansas, Tom Tancredo jumped into the race on the Constitution Party ticket. The GOP (and Tancredo) tried to get Maes to drop out, but he refused. The result? Hickenlooper won. It isn’t 100% known if a credible GOP candidate would have beaten Hickenlooper, but it’s completely possible. The same could be possible regarding the 2016 presidential election, if all the GOP leaders decide to go, “Vote Gary Johnson.”

Pence is probably staying on the GOP ticket. The Trump campaign has already released his travel schedule for this week, which suggests he’s in it for good. The Wall Street Journal also reports Pence isn’t leaving. It would still be a real kick in the head to see Pence heed the Libertarian Party’s call, drop out, and endorse Johnson. Who knows, it might get Johnson in the last debate. Of course, if tonight’s debate is a real brouhaha and Trump is going “all in” on Bill Clinton’s past deviancy, it’s going to be entertaining in a #headdesk sort of way."

Boom.

…and their minds were blown…

From The Blaze:

Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump said he plans to appoint a special prosecutor to examine Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton’s use of a private email server if he’s elected president during Sunday’s presidential debate. Trump said that he hadn’t planned to say this publicly, “but if I win, I am going to instruct my attorney general to get a special prosecutor to look into your situation.”

He added: “Because there has never been so many lies, so much deception. There has never been anything like it. And we’re going to have a special prosecutor.” …

“So we’re going to get a special prosecutor, and we’re going to look into it,” Trump said. “Because you know what? People have been — their lives have been destroyed for doing one fifth of what you’ve done. And it’s a disgrace. And honestly, you ought to be ashamed of yourself.” The ‘special prosecutor’ line alone should’ve swayed the majority of Independents and undecided voters Trump’s way.

Let’s take a look at what a bunch of polls are saying.

Here’s Variety… Mediaite: Drudge: One more… Not. Even. Close.

This result probably means Trump will gain in the polls over the next couple of days – if not more.

Good news for his campaign, and Trump needed it. "
100460,1008,The Trump Coalition? Ask Rudy Giuliani,http://www.americanthinker.com/articles/2016/10/the_trump_coalition_ask_rudi_giuliani.html,17,"We long-time New Yorkers know well Donald Trump’s brand of conservatism. It is rooted in the working class districts of New York City outside the wealthy avenues of Manhattan. We also know that Trump can’t win unless he heeds the experience of Rudy Giuliani, who turned middle-class anger into Republican election victory in liberal New York City 23 years ago.

Trump’s base is the middle class/working class district of Queens, New York, outside the wealthier Manhattan centers of power. Queens is a bastion of the Democratic, and yet very conservative, families who go to Mass on Sunday and vote Democratic on Tuesday. They are “conservative” in a way we New Yorkers understand conservatism: valuing work, thrift, family, the local priest, and country. Queens loved Mario Procacino, a Democrat machine politician of the 1960s who mocked the East Side of Manhattan calling them “limousine liberals.” Nationally, Queens became famous in 1971 as the home to the sitcom “All in the Family”, featuring Carol O’Connor as a Queens working-class dad with gruff, New York style conservative values.

In this 2016 election, Trump has galvanized his “All in the Family: voters. They are at his rallies, give him a solid 40% in national polls, and have him leading is beaten-up states like Ohio. But these All-in-the-Family voters are alien to the intellectual elite of the Republican Party, the party’s wealthy establishment, and its core suburban homeowning voter. That makes hit hard for Trump to get the remaining voters he needs to win a national election. But there is a way.

Trump has a role model standing right next to him at his rallies: former New York city Mayor Rudy Giuliani. Giuliani crossed the political lines of New York. Personally, he was from an Italian middle-class family -- the same core as Trump and Queens. But professionally, he was a lawyer at Rockefeller law firm Patterson, Belknap & Web that was tightly connected to the New York State Republican establishment. In his first try at New York City politics, Rudy Giuliani lost the mayoralty election to Harlem Clubhouse chief David Dinkins -- but Giuliani carried Queens by almost 50%! This was the part of the “conservative”, if not classically Republican, coalition that Trump already has.

In his next mayoral race, Giuliani pulled together the winning coalition. In his 1993 victory, Giuliani won the wealthy of Manhattan’s East Side, including establishment Republicans long comfortable with Rockefeller and former Mayor John V. Lindsay. And Giuliani won the Staten Island district that is a suburb set within the borders of greater New York City. And finally, Giuliani totally swept middle-class Queens, the home of “All in the Family”, with 63% of the vote there!

So there, in the 1993 Giuliani victory, we can see the coalition Trump needs to assemble nationwide. He already has the conservative middle-class rebellion vote. But he needs now the suburban Republicans and the wealthy business Republicans who voted for Giuliani, but to date have not embraced Trump. And Trump has not embraced them, as Giuliani did.

We New Yorker’s fondly remember the Giuliani of that 1993 election. Rudy was firm, but not angry. His platform, like his administration to come, focused on cleaning the streets of crime and beggars, making New York a safe place to walk and take the subway. He projected a quiet but firm “government do its job” attitude that appealed to the productive part of the city. Rudy didn’t carry the Bronx or Brooklyn, where too much of the population was dependent on government. But he did carry all the classes, and all the districts, of successful New York. So a Conservative Republican became mayor in this liberal city.

It is no wonder that Rudy Giuliani is campaigning so hard and devotedly for Donald Trump. Giuliani knows that he was elected mayor of New York, a Democrat Party town, by the Trumpians of Queens, together with the more traditionally Republican voters from conservative suburban and wealthy upper-class districts. And Giuliani also knows what the national Republican Party is just now finding out: Trump of Queens can put together a conservative coalition, but one that looks different from Kevin Phillips’ “Southern Strategy” coalition that has defined the national Republican Party since 1968.

Trump can do it. But he needs to learn from Giuliani. Trump is right that angry working and middle-class voters bring millions of new voters to the Republican Party. But Giuliani knows that these conservative families are not enough. Trump needs to appeal to the suburbs and traditionally conservative upper class. Trump has not yet done so. We’ll see if he learns from Giuliani in time.

100461,1008,Men without Chests Threaten Civilization,http://www.americanthinker.com/articles/2016/10/men_without_chests_threaten_civilization.html,17,"Mid-twentieth-century C. S. Lewis witnessed and wrote about the increasing moral breakdown and intellectual decay of Western civilization.  He observed how secular and atheistic academics, philosophers, politicians, intellectuals, and cultural elites abandoned reason, denied universal truths, undermined Christian doctrines, and rejected moral principles that formed the foundation of civilized society.  ""Lewis walked our cultural ground,"" explained Chris R. Armstrong.  ""He lived, as we do, in a society that denied objective value; lacked a coherent social ethic; wallowed in instant gratification, sexual license, moral evasion, and blame-shifting; and failed to pass on a moral framework to its children.""

In his book The Abolition of Man, Lewis warned that moral relativism (the denial of universal and objective moral truths and principles), foolish emotionalism, and the rejection of reason would bring about cultural decay and growing depravity.  When societies fail to teach morality and train the hearts of men to embrace and emulate virtuous behavior, they produce ""Men without Chests,"" individuals who are intelligent but behave like animals – men who don't practice the virtues and are controlled by their appetites.  Such men will lose their humanity, prophesied Lewis; they will no longer be human.

Many decades have passed since Lewis wrote his book, and things have gotten much worse.  While mainstream secular society still maintains that honor, ethics, and integrity matter, it has increasingly attacked, silenced, or destroyed those institutions and organizations that used to teach moral principles and universal truths that instilled honor and character into men's hearts and souls.

Not only has our modern educational establishment fully embraced moral relativism, but now other political and cultural institutions, including so-called progressive ""Christian"" churches and organizations, have followed suit.  As Lewis predicted, rampant carnality and decadence have increased exponentially as a result.  We're witnessing an explosion of sinful and immoral behavior of epidemic proportions.  Corruption, violence, mental illness, hypocrisy, wickedness, greed, addiction, promiscuity, sexual depravity, and other vices have become commonplace and affect ever larger segments of our society.

Worse still, a lot of ""Men without Chests"" are now in positions of power, influence, and authority in our society.  They are in charge of many public and private institutions.  Moral relativists and characterless individuals now serve in Congress and other branches of government, control the mainstream media, lead corporations and organizations, are in charge of public schools, run colleges and universities, and dominate most other public institutions.  Some even head religious and non-profit organizations.

Why is Lewis still relevant today?  Because he saw the early stages of the moral collapse, societal chaos, and cultural decay we're all now experiencing full force.  Inevitable destruction awaits all societies that reject universal moral principles, deny the existence of objective reality, and silence and punish those who teach and speak the truth.

Thankfully, Lewis also provided the solution.  Men must return to God, follow His moral principles, seek the truth, and lead virtuous lives.  His wisdom is as useful and applicable today as it was back then.

Hopefully it's not too late for us to learn from Lewis and avoid certain catastrophe.  After all, we are so much more than intelligent animals.  We were created by God with minds that reason and can discern truth, with consciences that judge and souls that search for eternal meaning, desire the divine, and seek the Lord, Creator, and Savior of everything visible and invisible. 

Read below how Lewis explained the dangers and effects of moral relativism to and on man's character and civilization as a whole.  To optimize readability, I've taken the liberty to break up his large paragraphs into smaller ones, make minor cosmetic edits, and provide brief notes and modern synonyms for words that aren't in common use today.  Great care has been taken to preserve the exact wording and original meaning of the author.

It still remains true that no justification of virtue will enable a man to be virtuous.  Without the aid of trained emotions the intellect is powerless against the animal organism.  I  had sooner play cards against a man who was quite skeptical about ethics, but bred to believe that ""a gentleman does not cheat,"" than against an irreproachable [impeccable] moral philosopher who had been brought up among sharpers [card-playing swindlers].

In battle it is not syllogisms [deductive reasoning] that will keep the reluctant nerves and muscles to their post in the third hour of the bombardment.  The crudest sentimentalism … about a flag or a country or a regiment will be of more use.  We were told it all long ago by Plato.  As the king governs by his executive, so Reason in man must rule the mere appetites by means of the ""spirited element.""  The head rules the belly through the chest – the seat, as Alanus tells us, of Magnanimity [generosity of spirit], of emotions organized by trained habit into stable sentiments.

The Chest – Magnanimity – Sentiment – these are the indispensable liaison officers between cerebral man and visceral [animal] man.  It may even be said that it is by this middle element that man is man: for by his intellect he is mere spirit and by his appetite mere animal.

The operation of The Green Book [book that promotes relativism] and its kind is to produce what may be called Men without Chests.  It is an outrage that they should be commonly spoken as Intellectuals.  This gives them the chance to say that he who attacks them attacks Intelligence.  It is not so.

They are not distinguished from other men by any unusual skill in finding truth nor any virginal ardour [passion] to pursue her.  Indeed it would be strange if they were: a persevering devotion to truth, a nice sense of intellectual honour, cannot be long maintained without the aid of a sentiment... It is not excess of thought but defect of fertile and generous emotion that marks them out.  Their heads are no bigger than the ordinary: it is the atrophy of the chest beneath that makes them seem so.

And all the time – such is the tragi-comedy of our situation – we continue to clamour for those very qualities we are rendering impossible.  You can hardly open a periodical without coming across the statement that what our civilization needs is more ""drive,"" or dynamism, or self-sacrifice, or ""creativity.""  In a sort of ghastly simplicity we remove the organ and demand the function.

We make men without chests and expect of them virtue and enterprise.  We laugh at honour and are shocked to find traitors in our midst.  We castrate and bid the geldings [castrated animals] be fruitful.

100462,1008,The Republican White Togas at Work for the Queen of Sleaze,http://www.americanthinker.com/articles/2016/10/the_republican_white_togas_at_work_for_the_queen_of_sleaze.html,17,"Years ago I wrote of my contempt for the white togaed squishes of the right who flee the grounds of the forum when jackals attack their allies in order to keep their garb free of stain. This week in the lead up to the second presidential debate tonight, they’re at it again.

Just as evidence of the Clinton corruption is once again made manifest in the release of more of her emails and a closer look at the late revised Clinton foundation filings, they flee Trump because of a suspiciously timed tape of an eleven-year-old conversation with GHW Bush’s nephew, Billy Bush. If, like a toddler, you are easily distracted by shining objects. you’ll fall for it. If you’re a grownup who realizes the fate of the world and this country depend on your vote you won’t.

1. How Hillary Broke the Law and Destabilized North Africa, creating a Refugee Crisis and a catastrophe in Libya and Syria

General Mike Flynn laid out the catastrophic results of then-Secretary of State Clinton’s actions in Libya, based on false claims that Qaddafi was engaged in widespread attacks on civilians.

While no saint, Qaddafi was key to our counterterrorism efforts in the area. Ignoring the advice of the secretary of defense and lawyers in her own department, Secretary Clinton allowed 18 shipments of arms from Qatar to Libyan jihadis who were on the State Department’s own list of foreign terrorists, in apparent violation of federal law (28 U.S. Code 2339A and 2339B). The arms shipments were funneled through a Qatar cleric “who brokered their release from prison” after Clinton persuaded the President to grant the terrorists full diplomatic recognition,

If that wasn’t bad enough, Flynn underscored the connection to the Clinton Foundation in her otherwise puzzling conduct:

Qatar has donated anywhere from $1 to $5 million to the Clinton Foundation, and emails reveal members of the Qatari royal family were privileged with back channel meetings with Secretary Clinton at the State Department. While whipping up support for the Libya military campaign, Clinton told Arab leaders, “it’s important to me personally,” the Washington Post reported.

Hillary Clinton’s prosecution of foreign policy in Libya crossed several lines: she showed extremely bad judgment by ignoring military and intelligence officials, she let personal interests conflict with U.S. foreign policy and, most importantly, she may have broken the law -- again.

2. Hillary’s speeches to Big Donors Reveal clearly her Deceptive nature and her view of Trump and Sanders supporters

Wikileaks revealed a batch of new hacked emails involving Hillary this week. As people sort through them, some gems from the well-paid speeches she gave to big corporate donors showed up. 

“My dream is a hemispheric common market, with open trade and open borders, some time in the future with energy that is as green and sustainable as we can get it, powering growth and opportunity for every person in the hemisphere.” [05162013 Remarks to Banco Itau.doc, p. 28]”

According to Politico:

Hacked audio of a conversation between Hillary Clinton and donors during a February fundraising event shows the Democrat nominee describing Bernie Sanders supporters as ""children of the Great Recession"" who are ""living in their parents’ basement.""

Speaking at a Virginia fundraiser hosted by former U.S. ambassador Beatrice Welters, Clinton says in a clip released by the Free Beacon that many of her former primary opponent's supporters sought things like “free college, free health care,” saying that she preferred to occupy the space ""from the center-left to the center-right"" on the political spectrum.

During the conversation, also reported in the Intercept, Clinton confesses to feeling ""bewildered"" by those to her far-left and far-right in the election.

""There is a strain of, on the one hand, the kind of populist, nationalist, xenophobic, discriminatory kind of approach that we hear too much of from the Republican candidates,"" she said. ""And on the other side, there’s just a deep desire to believe that we can have free college, free healthcare, that what we’ve done hasn’t gone far enough, and that we just need to, you know, go as far as, you know, Scandinavia, whatever that means, and half the people don’t know what that means, but it’s something that they deeply feel.""

4. Mud Slung and Squishes Run

Just as this hit the wires, NBC released a video of Billy Bush, a cousin of GW Bush and a nephew of GHW Bush, a TV personage, in a taped locker-room type conversation he had eleven years ago with Trump. For some this echoes the usual leftwing last minute charges against George Bush and John McCain falsely accusing them of sexual misconduct.

Trump quickly issued an apology: ""I've never said that I'm a perfect person, nor pretended to be someone that I'm not. I've said and done things I regret and the words released today on this more than a decade old video are one of them. Anyone who knows me knows these words don't reflect who I am. I said it, I was wrong and I apologize,"" Trump said.

Measured against the criminal corruption of Hillary and Bill this would seem to an ordinary observer to be insignificant. For Hillary it was “horrific”. Tom Maguire responds: 

The October Surprises keep piling up. Can'ya believe Trump made lewd comments about women? But Politico delivers the punchline:

“The audio represents an extraordinary level of vulgarity --Democrats quickly condemned Trump for casually joking about sexual assault -- even for a candidate who seized the Republican nomination through his proud embrace of political incorrectness.

‘This is horrific,’ Hillary Clinton said on Twitter. “We cannot allow this man to become president.’ “

A shortage of Twitter-space undoubtedly prevented her from tweeting her real thought, which must have been ""We cannot allow a man like this to become president again"".

As to whose mind might be changed by this, who can tell. The undecideds out there probably have guessed by now that this is Trump being Trump. 

I used to be a Democrat so nothing shocks me, but Paul Ryan, Mitt Romney, and others quickly virtue-signaled, in effect playing for Hillary.

Mitt’s response was the most perfervid. He claimed the taped words “demean our wives and daughters and corrupt America’s face to the world”. I cannot improve upon the responses of my online friends “daddy” and James D” to this nonsense.

James d:

The premier arts center in the nation's capital is named for a man who would have sex with anything that had breasts and a pulse, including a mobster's daughter and an East German spy, whose brother probably had Marilyn Monroe murdered, and whose other brother got an employee drunk, drove her into a river and left her to drown.

The former ""conscience of the Senate"" was a former klansman, and pretty much every public building in his state is named for him.

The husband of the current Democrat candidate for President (and a former President himself) settled a lawsuit for sexual harassment against a former employee, sodomized an intern in the Oval Office, and had about a million other sordid affairs, while his wife the current candidate used her taxpayer-paid staff to shred the reputations of her husband's victims.

All of those things happened while the criminals in question actually held high office.

How about you criticize THAT before going on about something Trump said during a private conversation a decade ago while he was a private citizen, you sanctimonious loser jackass. 

Daddy could not contain himself on Romney’s claim that this corrupted “America’s face to the world”.

Correct. It must make Putin and his mistress awful upset, and France's Hollande and his current mistress awful upset, and Italy's Berlusconi and all his former babes terribly upset, and Prince Charlie’s (“I want to be your tampon Camilla"") awful upset, and Mexico's president and his second Soap Opera Babe awful upset, and Canada's Trudeau (first or second doesn't matter even if she's banging Mick Jagger) and their babes on the side awful upset, and the head of the UN Climate Council, Pachori, who had to resign for banging underage whatevers awful upset, and whoever Hu in China was banging before he started banging his current TV show squeeze awful upset, and all the Middle Eastern potentates with multiple wives and dozens of concubines awful upset, and ISIS and their Yazidi Christian women sex slaves awful upset, and Kim Jung crazy Norkorea who puts his used chicks naked into cages to be devoured by ravenous dogs, it must make him awful upset too.

Yep. Trump saying ""Grab her by the pussy"" 11 years ago must make them all awful upset. Hopefully they'll give us some ice to put on it. 

In any event, GW Bush admitted he and his dad used the same sort of talk in private, and Vernon Jordan said when they were golfing he and Bill Clinton did, too.

5. Meantime, following Obama’s disengagement of America in the world and his destruction of U.S. military power, the world is getting more and more dangerous

Obama purges the officer corps, cuts our nuclear arsenal, and directs the military to focus on diversity appointments and transgender training. He strips veterans benefits and overlooks the shockingly bad care provided in VA hospitals while providing funds for transgender surgery for the troops, and generous benefits to illegal aliens and unvetted Syrian immigrants. In the meantime, Russia flexes its muscles in Syria, the Far East and Eastern Europe.

John Schindler reports: 

Today’s biggest news, however, comes from Estonian reports that the Russian military is sending Iskander-M missiles to Kaliningrad on a civilian freighter. It’s expected to dock in Kaliningrad today with its alarming cargo.

The Iskander-M system, called SS-26 by NATO… has a range of 300 miles and can carry either a conventional or a nuclear warhead. An Iskander-M based in Kaliningrad can strike targets deep in Poland and across the whole Baltic region. Make no mistake, this is primarily an offensive weapons system.

There’s a reason that the Kremlin promised to not ship this missile system to Kaliningrad back in 2009, in exchange for President Obama’s scuppering of missile defense in Poland and the Czech Republic. Activating an Iskander-M unit in Kaliningrad, west of the Baltic republics, is rightly seen as destabilizing by NATO’s whole eastern flank which, despite security promises by the White House, remains vulnerable to Russian attack. For Warsaw and several other NATO capitals, this move resembles a Baltic version of the Cuban Missile Crisis.

This constitutes a direct challenge to Washington by Moscow -- and by Vladimir Putin to Barack Obama, personally. The KGB officer in the Kremlin is seeking to get in one last, grand strategic humiliation for our president before he leaves office. And why not? Such reckless antics have worked well for the Russians so far, given Obama’s preference to avert eyes and hope for the best whenever Moscow misbehaves.

Unlike many, I believe that Trump will do fine in tonight’s debate, and I agree with Milton Rosenberg, who argues that ‘evaluation apprehension” keeps polls from accurately reflecting the margin of Trump’s support over Hillary's.

I doubt that Americans are so addlepated as to pick an incompetent, thoroughly corrupt globalist over an often-vulgar man who loves his country and has accomplished a great deal. I think this leak came so early in the month because Clinton and her allies fear this is true.

100463,1009,WHAT NOW FOR TRUMP?,http://www.powerlineblog.com/archives/2016/10/what-now-for-trump.php,17,"I’ve finally stopped smacking my head against my desk, and it does feel good to end the pounding. But the Trump Train Wreck is still happening. A few thoughts:

I got a lot of Twitter traffic today (@stevenfhayward if you don’t already follow)—maybe the most ever—for recounting Ronald Reagan’s reaction to the news of Gary Hart’s sexual peccadillos in 1987: “Boys will be boys—but boys will not be president.” While Hart was doomed, five years later we got more than a randy boy in the White House: we got full on sexual predator Bill Clinton, whose enabler wife is now on the ballot. A lot of respondents noted this fact, as though it should mean Trump should be held to the same standard, if not thought of more favorably, since Trump merely talked about grabbing women’s genitals while Bill Clinton actually did it.

But if conservatives stand for anything, it is to hold their own to a higher standard than liberals. It is a huge concession to what Pat Moynihan called “defining deviancy down” if we appeal to the Bill Clinton standard and the tendentious arguments liberals used in the 1990s to excuse his despicable behavior.

Beyond this, I’m wondering whether I can watch the debate this evening, or more to the point, let my kids watch it. The Clintons richly deserve to have their mendacity exploded in front of a huge audience. On the other hand, I can think of some rather effective Hillary retorts, and I imagine she’s got several in the can. Trump has already proven that he’s not very facile in a head-to-head debate with Hillary. Moreover, I’ve seen some press reports that there are polling and focus group results suggesting that a majority of Americans really don’t want to have Bill Clinton’s bad behavior from 20 years ago brought up. It’s not right; it’s not fair. But it is the world we live in.

I’m thinking the Clinton campaign is behind the release of this recording, and have run every angle on how it plays out. Everything seems in suspended animation right now. The next 24 to 48 hours may be the most extraordinary of any presidential campaign in our history."
100464,1009,TRUMP WINS,http://www.powerlineblog.com/archives/2016/10/trump-wins-2.php,17,"Some of the rats might want to consider returning to the ship. Donald Trump came through pretty well tonight, mainly because the focus was on the issues. As long as issues are being discussed, Trump wins.

The moderators came out of the box with questions about Trump’s 2005 video, which many people expected to be the centerpiece of tonight’s debate. The effort flopped, I thought. Bill and Hillary Clinton took appropriate shots. After ten or fifteen minutes the conversation moved on to the issues.

Thereafter, the moderators tried to help Hillary, and Trump appropriately complained a couple of times. But he got his licks in. As always, he was sometimes incoherent, but more often than not, he made more sense than Hillary, who was in full Nurse Ratched mode.

Happily, immigration figured prominently. Shockingly, in the first debate the moderator never mentioned the topic. Tonight, it was discussed extensively. That is a big plus for Trump. The exchanges on foreign policy were inconclusive, of course, but in general I think Trump did better. And there was even talk about Obamacare, which is great for Trump and Republicans.

In general, I don’t like town hall formats, but the virtue of the format tonight is that there were lots of questions about issues as opposed to the usual political stuff. Issues are good for Trump.

Trump was Trump tonight–he had some great moments, and also some incoherent ones. But he swung for the fences, for example, going after Hillary on her criminal conduct with regard to handling of national secrets. Hillary was Hillary. She yaks away in a manner that most people find obnoxious, and leaves herself open to the observation that she is all talk and no action.

The last few minutes were good for Trump. The question was, what do you admire about your opponent? Trump’s tribute to Hillary as a persistent fighter was well done.

In short, Trump won. In my opinion, he won big. We will see whether it matters."
100465,1009,"TRUMP BOUNCES BACK, BUT BACK TO WHERE?",http://www.powerlineblog.com/archives/2016/10/trump-bounces-back-but-back-to-where.php,17,"My view is that Donald Trump won tonight’s debate. He dominated the stage and landed shot after shot on Hillary Clinton. Hillary, meanwhile, struggled to say much that will connect with voters except perhaps Muslim-Americans.

This was the performance Trump’s supporters wanted to see in the first debate. If the Access Hollywood tape had not surfaced, Trump might be well on his way to pulling back to even, or close to even, with Clinton.

But the tape did surface and it dominated the first part of the debate, during which Trump, naturally, was at his least effective. I don’t think he did badly on the tape. Initially, he did what I thought was required of him — express remorse over his comments (though he could have done so more effectively) and move on to the issues.

The moderators, though, were determined not to let him off that easily. When pressed, he unloaded on Bill Clinton for his predatory conduct and, in a good move, against Hillary — not for being married to Bill but for getting the rapist of a 12 year-old girl off and then laughing about it on tape (the victim was in the audience tonight).

Trump then turned to Hillary’s emails. He attacked her on them much more effectively than during the first debate. However, he overplayed his hand, I think, when he said that in a Trump administration, Hillary will be in jail.

Threatening to imprison your female political opponent doesn’t seem like the path to winning the support of voters, especially females, who are concerned about your temperament and the way you treat women. It’s possible that in this moment Trump did his candidacy serious damage.

Regardless of how one scores this portion of the slugfest, it was as riveting as anything I’ve seen on television, not just in a debate but in any non-sports program. There was Trump, stalking around the stage like an animal fighting for survival. There was Clinton, hoping to land the blows that would finish Trump off, but being thrown off balance by the ferocity of his punches, and trying to figure out whether Trump was destroying his candidacy or substantially reviving it.

At various stages, Trump came close to doing both. In the end, I think he did neither. And after fighting as ferociously as he did tonight, it should be clear to even those most prone to wishful thinking that Trump isn’t stepping down.

I’m not going to predict just where the polls will stand after this debate and whatever “afters” take place (last time the “afters” regarding Miss Universe seemed to hurt Trump at least as much as the debate itself). However, I will speculate that any boost Trump receives from his strong performance tonight may, at best, only offset the damage from the Access Hollywood tape.

Unfortunately for Trump, he was already significantly, though not hopelessly, behind when the tape emerged. And it may not be the last one we see."
100466,1010,A list of faith leaders calling out the Religious Right for failing to abandon Trump,https://thinkprogress.org/a-list-of-faith-leaders-calling-out-the-religious-right-for-failing-to-abandon-trump-7a2ee8fb26e6#.daigrgjiy,17,"Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump has been grappling with scandal since Friday evening, when the Washington Post released a controversial video that showed him bragging about sexually assaulting women several years ago. The tape, along with similar audio recordings unveiled by CNN soon thereafter, have prompted many in the GOP to un-endorse or even decline to vote for the business mogul, saying his remarks are simply too much.
Yet many members of the Religious Right have refused to rescind their support for Trump by excusing away his remarks, condemning them but reiterating their support for his candidacy, or simply remaining silent.
Their steadfast support for Trump has not gone over well with many of their fellow faithful. Progressive and conservative Christians alike have begun expressing outrage at religious leaders who still back Trump, taking them to task on social media and in the press.
Here are a few examples. (Note: this list will be updated)
Beth Moore, prominent evangelical author and founder of Living Proof Ministries
Beth Moore had zero tolerance for evangelical leaders who refused to denounce Trump’s remarks, citing her own experience. Russell Moore, head of the Southern Baptist Convention’s political arm
Moore has been a vocal opponent of Trump’s, insisting that the candidate represents the opposite of “everything [evangelical Christians] believe.”
But in the wake of the video release, he apparently couldn’t abide members of his religious circle who continued to support the businessman. Al Mohler, president of the Southern Baptist Theological Seminary
Mohler was quick to express frustration with his fellow evangelicals immediately after the news broke. Mohler then published an Op-Ed in the Washington Post on Sunday, blasting his fellow right-wing Christians for sticking by Trump.
“They are wrong, I believe, to serve as apologists for Donald Trump,” he writes. “The release of the sexually-explicit tape revealed Trump in a light that must be the worst nightmare for the candidate’s campaign. It revealed a sexual predator, not merely a playboy.”
Eric Teetsel, former faith advisor to Marco Rubio
Teetsel has been an ardent opponent of Trump and his evangelical supporters for some time. He expressed none-too-subtle frustration with Christian conservatives who continue to support The Donald. Collin Hansen, editorial director for the Gospel Coalition
Hansen penned a blistering critique of Religious Right leaders who support Trump in the Washington Post.
“To the older evangelicals planning to vote for Trump: You can try to explain the difference in electing a president and hiring a 23-year-old college graduate to evangelize students,” he writes. “You can say we’re electing a commander in chief and not a Sunday school teacher. You can say that God often raises up pagan leaders to deliver his people from their enemies. But no one is fooled by your arguments.”
“They can see you will apparently excuse anything in a Republican nominee so long as the alternative is a manifestly unqualified Clinton. And they will conclude that they don’t really need to listen to you when it comes to ‘traditional, biblical ethics.’”
“The 2016 presidential election will be remembered as the last spasm of energy from the Religious Right before its overdue death,” he added. “Grace abounds for Christians who fall short of the glory of God and call on the name of Jesus for forgiveness and salvation. But woe to the hypocrites who hold the most powerful leader in the world to a lower standard than they do the searching young believer who desires to serve God and neighbor.”
CatholicVote.org, a conservative Catholic advocacy organization
“Newly released comments by Donald Trump…are disgusting and simply indefensible,” the organization wrote in a statement. “Catholic voters rightly will be unnerved by these developments.”
“In our own opinion the viability of Donald Trump’s candidacy is now in question. Furthermore, the good many hoped to achieve, in spite of Trump’s many well-known flaws, is also now in doubt. If Donald Trump is unwilling to step aside, the Republican National Committee must act soon out of basic decency and self-preservation.”
Rachel Held Evans, prominent Christian author, blogger, and speaker
Evans, who has deeply critical of evangelicalism in recent years—the tradition in which she was raised—demanded her spiritual brethren rebuke Trump after the tapes were released. Andy Crouch, editorial director of Christianity Today
Crouch penned an extensive critique of Trump and the evangelicals who support him in Christianity Today. He accused evangelicals who side with Trump for “strategy” reasons of being idolators.
“…There is a point at which strategy becomes its own form of idolatry_—_an attempt to manipulate the levers of history in favor of the causes we support,” he writes. “Strategy becomes idolatry, for ancient Israel and for us today, when we make alliances with those who seem to offer strength_—_the chariots of Egypt, the vassal kings of Rome_—_at the expense of our dependence on God who judges all nations, and in defiance of God’s manifest concern for the stranger, the widow, the orphan, and the oppressed. Strategy becomes idolatry when we betray our deepest values in pursuit of earthly influence. And because such strategy requires capitulating to idols and princes and denying the true God, it ultimately always fails.
“Enthusiasm for a candidate like Trump gives our neighbors ample reason to doubt that we believe Jesus is Lord,” he adds. “They see that some of us are so self-interested, and so self-protective, that we will ally ourselves with someone who violates all that is sacred to us_—_in hope, almost certainly a vain hope given his mendacity and record of betrayal, that his rule will save us.”

Bass’ criticism of the religious right was short and to the point. Ed Stetzer, speaker and theology professor at Wheaton College, an evangelical Christian school
 Noah Toly, professor of politics and international relations at Wheaton College
Toly called out “so called leaders among evangelicals” in a Tumblr post.
“Trump’s departure from Christian teachings at this point is absolute,” he writes. “It’s not a matter of tone, convention, or word choice. When it comes to the ways he treats women, Trump not only falls short of Christian standards, but he falls short of human decency. In these recordings, he admits to_—_and celebrates_—_being a sexual predator. Christians should condemn that behavior for the vile filth that it is. Instead many fantasize that it doesn’t exist or doesn’t matter.”
“Let me make one thing clear: Evangelical Christians shouldn’t vote for Trump,” he added. “Evangelical Christians tempted to vote for Trump should acknowledge that they don’t get to vote for ‘fantasy Trump,’ the decent person with a loud minority of indecent supporters.”
Erick Erickson, prominent conservative blogger and radio host
Erickson when on a lengthy diatribe about Trump’s latest scandal. Erickson also wrote an Op-Ed in the Washington Post entitled “Donald Trump is finally an evangelical bridge too far.”
“While evangelicals probably will not publicly walk away from Trump, I suspect we will see them start to fade into the shadows as defeat draws near,” he writes. “If they are still concerned about saving the Supreme Court, they might want to publicly call on Trump to get out of the race in favor of Indiana Gov. Mike Pence. That is the final option.”
Rev. William Barber II, pastor and head of the North Carolina NAACP
Barber published an Op-Ed in CNN on Monday decrying not just evangelicals who still back Trump, but also those who are rescinding their support, arguing their change of heart is hypocritical.
“As an evangelical Christian, I am deeply disturbed by the hypocrisy of the outrage at Trump’s comments on sexual assault,” he writes. “Yes, it is outrageous for anyone to talk the way he did about another human being. But the violence of the Trump tape isn’t new. What’s new is that the woman he was talking about looks like the wives and daughters of the white men who’ve rallied the religious right behind Donald Trump.”
He then offered the following:
When Trump promised a wall to keep out Mexicans, many who are now “outraged” cheered him on. When he pledged to ban all Muslims from traveling to America, they celebrated his defense of “religious freedom.” When he supported voter suppression laws that sought to abridge the right to vote for African-Americans, Latinos and poor people, they stood with him. When he announced that he would repeal the Affordable Care Act, a move that would devastate the lives of many poor working women and men, they endorsed him. When he said he did not support making the minimum wage a living wage, they lifted him up as what America needed. When he announced an economic plan that would take us back into recession, hurting many working families, they declared him the one for the country. When he unashamedly vowed to block gun laws that would help keep assault weapons off the street, they applauded him. And when Trump mocked women, people with disabilities, and his political opponents, the religious right stood by their man.
But now he has gone too far?

Grudem, who previously supported Trump, published an Op-Ed in Townhall on Sunday condemning Trump and asking him to drop out of the race.
“I previously called Donald Trump a ‘good candidate with flaws’ and a ‘flawed candidate’ but I now regret that I did not more strongly condemn his moral character,” he writes. “I cannot commend Trump’s moral character, and I strongly urge him to withdraw from the election.”

100467,1010,Trump’s defense: He was only a misogynist the first 69 years of his life,https://thinkprogress.org/giuliani-defends-trump-changed-man-98ce9b322c12#.s0tma3s42,17,"Fourteen months on the campaign trail apparently outweighs decades of public life, at least for the dwindling number of Trump loyalists.
Voters needn’t worry about Donald Trump saying he gropes women and gets away with it because he’s famous, Rudy Giuliani repeatedly claimed on Sunday, because the process of campaigning for high office has left Trump a changed man.
“That was then and this is now. He’s gone through 14 months of running for president, and as you know running for president does something to change you,” Giuliani told ABC’s George Stephanopoulos.
“I think that alone has put a heavier weight of responsibility on his shoulders than he ever had when even he was an entertainment star in the star of the apprentice,” the ex-mayor said on CNN. “It’s a different man that emerges when you campaign around the country for a year and a half and hear the concerns and the problems of the American people.”
CNN host Jake Tapper responded by noting that Trump was “59 or 60 years old” when he bragged on a hot mic about being able to sexually assault women because “when you’re a star, they let you do it. You can do anything. Grab them by the pussy.”
Giuliani tried again on NBC, but again flubbed the spin by accusing Hillary Clinton of being two different people in public and in private. Todd pounced.
“Should we assume Donald Trump on that bus is what he’s like in private? That’s what you’re saying,” Todd said.
Giuliani sighed heavily before responding that “this is a situation where neither side should throw stones, because both sides have sinned.”
The line led Giuliani’s spin in each interview, including an appearance on CBS’ Face the Nation. “He’s a different man now than he was then having gone through 14 months of a campaign that having gone through it myself convinces you of a lot of things are important that maybe you don’t realize before,” he told John Dickerson.
“He has his set of flaws, I have mine,” he added. “I guess there are a few perfect people, but in my view there’s only been one and that was Jesus Christ.”
Giuliani was the only Trump surrogate to appear on the Sunday news shows, after others like GOP chairman Reince Priebus and campaign chair Kellyanne Conway either withdrew or were sidelined by the campaign.
He offered the same spin on each show_—_and in the version of it he gave to Fox News’ Chris Wallace, the former New York mayor even invoked his own experience with the September 11 terrorist attacks.
“[Campaigns] literally make you into a different kind of person. I think September 11th and running for president made me a different kind of person,” he said.
It’d be easier to push a ball of molasses up a sand dune than convince people that Trump has abandoned misogynistic thinking since running for office. He has continued to attack women who criticize him over their appearance throughout the race. The week after the first debate, he doubled down on the idea that a former winner of his beauty pageant was horrible because she put on weight after winning.
Trump’s habit of deriding women today and his avowed belief he can take what he wants sexually in the 2005 recordings published Friday lend weight to a long string of allegations about his actual behavior toward women.
Multiple women have accused Trump of violating them in various ways down the years.
Makeup artist Jill Harth says Trump pushed her against a wall in his daughter’s bedroom and tried to reach up her dress in 1993 while her husband was in another room of Trump’s Florida estate. Trump denies the story. A Miss USA contestant in 1997 named Temple Taggart says the first time she ever met Trump he walked up and kissed her square on the lips. CNN anchor Erin Burnett relayed a similar story from an unnamed friend.
An unidentified woman sued Trump earlier this year saying he raped her in 1994. Jane Doe was 13 at the time, according to her lawsuit, which details that he tied her to a bed and hit her when she screamed. Trump again denies the allegations in the suit, which is due for an initial hearing in December.
Trump’s ex-wife Ivana has also said Trump once raped her during their marriage, in 1989. Trump’s attorney responded by claiming that men can’t rape their own wives.
Those are just the most directly physical allegations women have made against Trump, out of dozens more stories about his aggressive private behavior with models, pageant contestants, and others."
100468,1010,Giuliani won’t acknowledge Trump’s ‘pussy’ comments as sexual assault,https://thinkprogress.org/giuliani-wont-acknowledge-trump-s-pussy-comments-as-sexual-assault-8b3f56cb0f2d#.nlu6w48o7,17,"In a round of cable news interviews Sunday, former New York Mayor Rudy Giuliani went on the defensive for Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump’s comments about how his stardom allows him to treat women however he wants in a 2005 recording that surfaced over the weekend.
CNN’s Jake Tapper asked Giuliani what his response was to Trump “essentially voicing a casual attitude toward sexual assault,” to which he responded by saying Trump has apologized for the “horrible” remarks and and then pivoted to economic policy.
“They’re remarks you certainly don’t want to hear from anyone, much less a presidential candidate. Then when you reflect on it, he apologized for them. He said he realized that he was wrong, that doesn’t reflect the way he looks at things today. And I think he made a full and complete apology for it. He probably is going to do it again tonight. So, then we have to factor that into all the other things that are evolved in this election which includes what’s going to happen with our economy, what’s going to happen with us nationally.”
Tapper struck back in saying, “First of all, let me say that I don’t know that a lot of people who saw the tape who saw the apology thought it was a sincere apology. I’ve heard Trump supporters describe it as not seeming sincere...Normally a full and contrite apology is just an acceptance that one did something wrong.”
Giuliani later said “Gosh almighty, he who hasn’t sin throw the first stone here.” To which Tapper replied, “I’m happy to throw a stone. I don’t know any man, I’ve been in locker rooms, I’ve been a member of a fraternity, I have never heard any man ever brag about being able to maul women because they get away with it, never.”
Giuliani fought Round 2 on ABC with George Stephonopoulos telling the host that Trump is a changed man now that he’s a running for president.
Stephonopoulos retorted saying that Trump, then 60, described sexual assault on the tape: “The problem isn’t just the words. As both Sen. McCain and Vice President Biden pointed out, what Trump is describing in that tape is sexual assault.”
Giuliani insisted that the GOP candidate was being braggadocious despite having a history of being accused of harassment and assault. “That’s what he’s talking about. Whether it happened or not, I don’t know. How much exaggeration was involved in that, I don’t know. I do know there’s a tendency on the part of some men at different times to exaggerate things like this.”
“He said some very bad things 10 or 12 years ago. He’s apologized for it. It seems to me we should move on,” the former mayor said.
Giuliani’s defense of Trump’s remarks is indicative of how casually sexual assault is viewed in society. In his ABC interview he continued saying that he didn’t condone Trump’s behavior but said it was tantamount to a sin that could be absolved.
“I’m not trying to excuse or condone it. There is no excuse or answer for it other than [saying] ‘I’m very sorry and I wish I hadn’t done it and I’m not like that anymore.’ It sorta goes back to my faith I guess_—_you confess your sins and you make a firm resolution not to commit that sin again, and then the priest gives you absolution, and then hopefully you’re a changed person.”
CBS’ John Dickerson asked Giuliani again about how Trump was “speaking jocularly about sexual assault” to which the former mayor referenced religion and redemption.
Giuliani responded, “I hate to get terribly theological about it but have you ever read the confessions of St. Augustine? I mean the reality is men can change, people can change. Sometimes going through things like this makes you into a much better person.”
That may be true but that doesn’t mean Trump’s words aren’t telling.
Giuliani’s repeated deflections coupled with Trump’s stiff apology statement echoes the flippant nature of other powerful men’s initial reactions to high-profile sexual assault or harassment scandals. People like Bill Cosby and Fox News’ Roger Ailes enjoyed the benefit of such doubt for years. The common theme: powerful men accused of lewd behavior that are initially dismissed.
The father of former Stanford University student athlete Brock Turner who was convicted of sexual assault, famously said that his son shouldn’t be punished harshly for “20 minutes of fun.” NBA star Derrick Rose is on trial for assaulting a young woman with whom he had a relationship. In his deposition, Rose admitted that he didn’t know what “consent” was and asked it to be explained to him. And later the judge presiding over the case told Rose and his attorneys to stop slut-shaming the victim."
100469,1001,"Trump threatens to put Clinton jail, taking the entire Republican Party down with him",http://www.dailykos.com/stories/2016/10/10/1580353/-Trump-threatens-to-put-Clinton-jail-taking-down-the-entire-Republican-Party-with-him,18,"Another debate full of … crazy. But Donald Trump declaring that Hillary Clinton “would be in jail” if he won made this a perfect night for Democrats up and down the ballot—from Clinton on down. 

That segment alone ensured that the Republican base—already unconcerned about Trump’s “pussy” remarks—would be particularly amped up. To them, Trump’s validation of their “lock her up” chants signaled a debate victory so huge, you have never seen such a victory before in the history of the world!

Never mind that Trump’s real challenge was to expand  his base of support, given that he’s already losing big. But he didn’t care about that. He spoke directly to his base, and to them, this was everything they could’ve hoped for and more. They are madly in love. 

But back in the real world, downballot Republicans are panicking, with many having already fled that sinking ship. But not only is their newfound independence too little, too late, but Trump’s successful rallying of his base last night made it harder for more Republicans to follow suit—something virtually all of them want to.

Last night, Trump had just a single elected American official in the spin room, Sen. Jeff Sessions. Apparently Chris Christie was too tired of fetching McDonalds for the Donnster to attend the debate. Rudy Giuliani had to perform the job of 10 surrogates in the Sunday morning talk shows, since no one else appeared interested. 

And it’s no secret why elected officials have made themselves so scarce: Trump is tanking them all. He was already killing them before the “pussy” tape was released:

Mr. Trump has already slipped perceptibly in public polls, trailing widely this week in Pennsylvania and by smaller margins in Florida and North Carolina — three states he cannot afford to lose. But private polling by both parties shows an even more precipitous drop, especially among independent voters, moderate Republicans and women, according to a dozen strategists from both parties
And the situation has certainly worsened post-”locker room banter that wasn’t in a locker room at all” tape:

Former Representative Thomas M. Reynolds of New York, a former chairman of the National Republican Congressional Committee, said party polling had found voters tilting toward Democrats in congressional elections, even before the latest revelations about Mr. Trump. His setbacks threatened to push voters further away from Republicans, Mr. Reynolds said.
Also: Marco Rubio was pulling away in Florida, but new info (like the tweet above) suggests it’s back in play. It would be fitting if Donald Trump was the reason Rubio went down in flames, wouldn’t it? The Pennsylvania, North Carolina, and New Hampshire Senate races have been tossups for months. Putting them away would allow us to focus on expanding the map, like grabbing that Missouri Senate seat. 

And if numbers are cratering in those states, Arizona can’t be immune, not with Sen. John McCain having tied himself so tightly to Trump. Nevada has to be looking stronger as a hold. Evan Bayh’s deteriorating lead in Indiana has to be stabilizing. And dare we hope that Iowa could swing back into contention? 

But note, even the five Senate races in that tweet, plus our sure-fire pickups in Illinois and Wisconsin, would get us to a 53-47 Democratic Senate. 55-45 doesn’t look unreasonable, which would be huge given our difficult 2018 Senate map. 

And the House? The House is in play. 

Geoffrey Skelley, of the University of Virginia’s Center for Politics, argues that a Clinton victory of 6-points or more might be enough to put the House back in play.
Our own math here at Daily Kos shows that a six-point generic congressional ballot lead would give Democrats a 50-50 chance to take back the House. 

Currently, Clinton’s lead in the polling aggregate is 6.3 points, while in the generic congressional ballot it’s 4.2 points. So we’re on the cusp of a big House changeover, but not quite there. But this is pre-”the GOP nominee is into sexually assaulting women” polling, and also doesn’t account for depressed conservative turnout. And, let’s not forget, Republicans are admitting that their own private polling is even more pessimistic than the public numbers. 

For their part, Democrats are rushing into the field with a new round of polling to get a new lay of the land:

The Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee planned to do rapid polling early this week to measure the impact of Mr. Trump on the House battlefield.
If we see numbers released by the end of the week, we know they look extra good, and that the House is, indeed, in play. 

So … what do those numbers have to do with Trump’s performance last night?  This: Republicans are caught in a no-win scenario: if they stick with Trump, they go down with the ship. But if they part ways, they have to deal with the wrath of Trump and his supporters.  Trump turned in a great performance last night. He wasn’t trying to win new votes. He was sending notice to the GOP—stay in line, or else. It certainly didn’t get him any closer to winning the election, but he made extra sure that few others in his party would win, either.  

We won’t win the House by sitting on the sidelines. Give a few bucks to our endorsed slate of House candidates!"
100470,1001,How ya gonna keep 'em voting Trump (after they've seen Paree)?,http://www.dailykos.com/stories/2016/10/10/1578968/-How-ya-gonna-keep-em-voting-Trump-after-they-ve-seen-Paree,18,"A poll released on Thursday from the Public Religion Research Institute showed Hillary Clinton leading Donald Trump 47-41 in the presidential race; by itself, that’s not that interesting, since that’s right where polling averages have the race. But one particular finding from their poll got a lot of attention in the media, simply because it’s a question no one has really thought to ask before, but the answer makes a lot of intuitive sense.

White voters who still live in the community in which they were raised are supporting Trump over Clinton by 26 percentage points (57% vs. 31%, respectively). Trump also has an advantage over Clinton among white voters who live within a 2-hour drive from their hometown (50% vs. 41%, respectively). However, among white voters who live farther away from their hometown, Clinton leads Trump (46% vs. 40%, respectively).
(PRRI, like Pew Research, specializes in asking deeper questions than the more mundane media pollsters, who tend to just ask about who people are voting for and their demographic data. For example, their study from November 2015, “Anxiety, Nostalgia, and Mistrust,” introduced a lot of subtlety into the debate over whether the Trump phenomenon was more about “economic anxiety” or racism, revealing that it’s about both, but bound together with a sentimental longing for something that doesn’t exist any more (and may never have existed in the first place).)

Their new finding about mobility … and the correlation between Trump support among people who are rooted in place vs. Clinton support among people who get up and move … goes a long way toward explaining the new map that we’re seeing in 2016 (which isn’t that new, really, but it’s a further evolution of trends we’ve been seeing since the 1990s). The Republicans are increasingly becoming the party of rural and exurban voters, and, relatedly, people who tend to be aggrieved about getting the short end of the stick in an increasingly globalized, knowledge-based economy. The Democrats are increasingly the party of urban and suburban voters, in other words, people who are likelier to be prospering in an economy that’s increasingly spiky and where the upward spikes are likelier to be in major metropolitan areas.

The question of mobility isn’t a clear-cut one, in terms of seeing causality or even correlation. As PRRI points out, mobility is strongly related to education. They found that 35 percent of Americans live in the town where they were born, 27 percent live within a two-hour drive of their hometown, and 37 percent live more than two hours away. But among those who live in their hometown, 53 percent have a high school education or less, while only 29 percent of those living two hours away or more have only a high school education or less.

So, it’s a chicken-and-egg question: does education make it likelier that you’ll move away? (In other words, to get a job that utilizes the college education that you received, you're probably going to need to move to a major metro area, instead of staying somewhere where the economy is dominated by manufacturing, agriculture, or just the service industry.) Or are the restless, curious people who are likelier to move away also the ones who are likelier to get educated? (And you have to consider that moving somewhere else to go to college is that important first step in getting out of town and severing old ties.)

But there’s an even deeper undercurrent in the election, that Josh Barro tried to get at last month, but is especially relevant in the wake of this PRRI data: a lot of what’s going on is simply about optimism vs. pessimism (and how those abstract qualities can get geographically concentrated), as well as openness vs. intolerance.

Donald Trump is underperforming the typical Republican candidate in states that are magnets for migration — places like North Carolina, Colorado, Georgia, and Texas.

He's doing unusually well in states where net migration is low or even negative, such as Iowa, Maine, and Michigan.
Barro pointed out that you can see this in particular if you zoom in on neighboring states where there’s a lot of migration in one vs. little migration in the other (New Hampshire and Maine, in this year’s case), or at different demographics within a state (such as North Carolina, where there’s been a lot of migration to the Charlotte and Raleigh/Durham areas, and the recent NYT/Siena poll showed a big polling gap between voters born in the state vs. those born out of the state).

If you delve a little deeper into Census data, you can see that relationship. The Census doesn’t ask whether you live more than two hours from home, but it does ask whether you live in the same state you were born in. Here are the percentages of people born in a different state than where they now live, for selected swing states:

Nevada 53.1

New Hampshire 50.8

Arizona 45.9

Colorado 45.9

Florida 40.3

Virginia 36.5

Georgia 33.8

North Carolina 33.8

Maine 31.6

Missouri 29.1

Iowa 23.6

Wisconsin 23.0

Ohio 19.6

Pennsylvania 18.9 

Michigan 16.1
Hopefully you’re seeing the pattern … the states where Clinton is overperforming (Colorado, Virginia) are among the ones with a higher level of movers. The ones where she’s underperforming relative to usual Democrat performance (Iowa, Ohio) are some of the ones with the most people staying in place. The two real deviations seem to be Nevada (where she isn’t faring as well, thanks to low levels of college-educated whites) and Pennsylvania (where she is doing well, probably because there’s enough diversity and education in the Philadelphia area to overcome the high levels of aging-in-place you see throughout the rest of the state).

As Barro’s article discusses, though, there’s more to this than just education or other easily described demographic categories. There are potentially different mindsets at work between those who move and those who don’t: he argues that moving is a sign of openness to change, and also agency over one’s own life, actively seeking out new opportunities and experiences, instead of just sitting in place and brooding over who else to blame for one’s lot in life.

And you can see that in the whole frameworks that the two presidential campaigns operate in, not just in terms of policy but also rhetoric (or “branding,” if you prefer). One is about inclusion and looking forward; the other is a dark, dour campaign about fear of the outsiders showing up and resentment about having gotten left behind as the broader culture changes."
100471,1001,It's Trump 2005 vs. Trump 2016 in new Clinton campaign ad,http://www.dailykos.com/stories/2016/10/10/1580444/-It-s-Trump-2005-vs-Trump-2016-in-new-Clinton-campaign-ad,18,"Donald Trump’s blatant, shameless debate-night lying about what he said in 2005 was perfect fodder for an ad, and the Clinton campaign moved on that right away. All they had to do was cut together the debate footage with the 2005 hot mic footage:

Cooper: You described kissing women without consent.

Trump 2016: No, I didn’t say that at all. I don’t think you understood what was said.

Trump 2005: You know I’m automatically attracted to beautiful—I just start kissing them. It’s like a magnet. Just kiss. I don’t even wait.

Trump 2016: This was locker room talk. 

Cooper: Grabbing their genitals.

Trump 2005: Grab them by the [censored]. You can do anything.

Trump 2016: … locker room talk.

Trump 2005: And when you’re a star, they let you do it. You can do anything.

Trump 2016: No, I didn’t say that at all. I don’t think you understood what was said. This was locker room talk.
The ad ends with, “If he believes this is locker room talk, how can we believe he’s sorry?” There are so many layers of noxiousness here. Trump thinks he has apologized. Doubtless he feels aggrieved at having been forced to do so. But he didn’t just lie—though he certainly lied. He also showed that he doesn’t understand or acknowledge what was wrong about the actions he bragged about so gleefully in 2005. 

Really, the question is not just “How can we believe he’s sorry?” The key question is: do we believe he doesn’t still think the exact same way? Watch the ad below.

100472,1002,The Art of the Comeback: Donald Trump’s Debate Win Propels Him Toward White House,http://www.breitbart.com/big-government/2016/10/10/art-comeback-donald-trumps-debate-win-propels-him-white-house/,18,"ST. LOUIS, Missouri — It wouldn’t be Trumpian if there weren’t any fireworks.
Donald Trump, the 2016 GOP presidential nominee, crushed his Democratic opponent Hillary Rodham Clinton in Sunday evening’s debate at Washington University in St. Louis—propelling him closer to the White House and past, perhaps, the roughest stretch of his campaign yet.

“It was an absolute home run for Mr. Trump,” Jason Miller, Trump’s senior communications adviser, told Breitbart News in the spin room after the debate. “This was a game-changing victory. You know what? The underdog is back.”

Several key exchanges in the debate proved Trump to be the better candidate on Sunday night, the most important of which was when Trump forced out on his own with no help from moderators CNN’s Anderson Cooper and ABC News’ Martha Raddatz: when Trump said he would appoint a special and independent prosecutor to investigate the Clinton email scandal.

Trump held his own through six straight questions with which Raddatz and others peppered him, opening the debate about the recently surfaced video of him using lewd language with former President George H.W. Bush’s nephew Billy Bus; then when Hillary Clinton brought up the birther questions again—trying to force that into the conversation—Trump trapped her.

“He [Trump] owes the president an apology, he owes our country an apology, and he needs to take responsibility for his actions and his words,” Clinton said, regarding the birther issue.

After detailing how it is actually Hillary Clinton who owes President Obama an apology because she started the birther narrative—it’s been proven that Clinton ally Sidney Blumenthal pushed the story back in the 2008 campaign, as did at least two people on Clinton’s campaign—Trump shifted the conversation to questions about her emails.

“But when you talk about apology, I think the one that you should really be apologizing for and the thing that you should be apologizing for are the 33,000 e-mails that you deleted, and that you acid washed, and then the two boxes of e-mails and other things last week that were taken from an office and are now missing,” Trump said, before dropping the mega-bomb: a special prosecutor to independently investigate Clinton.

“And I’ll tell you what. I didn’t think I’d say this, but I’m going to say it, and I hate to say it. But if I win, I am going to instruct my attorney general to get a special prosecutor to look into your situation because there has never been so many lies, so much deception. There has never been anything like it, and we’re going to have a special prosecutor,” Trump said, adding:

When I speak, I go out and speak, the people of this country are furious. In my opinion, the people that have been long-term workers at the FBI are furious. There has never been anything like this, where emails — and you get a subpoena, you get a subpoena, and after getting the subpoena, you delete 33,000 emails, and then you acid wash them or bleach them, as you would say, very expensive process. So we’re going to get a special prosecutor, and we’re going to look into it because you know what? People have been — their lives have been — destroyed for doing one-fifth of what you’ve done. And it’s a disgrace. And honestly, you ought to be ashamed of yourself.

After Clinton accused Trump of “lies” without detailing any, and as Raddatz attempted to intervene to save her, she begged the so-called “fact checkers” for help.

“It’s just awfully good that someone with the temperament of Donald Trump is not in charge of the law in our country,” she added.

In response, Trump fired back his most aggressive and bold comeback all year: “Because you’d be in jail.”

Another key moment came when Raddatz tried to press Trump on his plan to temporarily halt Islamic migration into America from nations with terrorism problems. Hillary Clinton, in her previous answer—in a response to an Islamophobia question from an audience member—had attacked Trump over the Khan Gold Star family controversy again. Trump, in his reply to Raddatz’s question, flipped the whole thing back on Clinton—who, unlike Trump, supported the war in Iraq.

“First of all, Captain Khan is an American hero, and if I were president at that time, he would be alive today because, unlike her, who voted for the war without knowing what she was doing, I would not have had our people in Iraq. Iraq was a disaster,” Trump said. “So he would have been alive today.”

“The Muslim ban is something that in some form has morphed into an extreme vetting from certain areas of the world,” Trump continued. “Hillary Clinton wants to allow hundreds of thousands…”

Raddatz then interrupted him.

“Excuse me. Excuse me,” Trump talked over her.

“And why did it morph into that? No, did you — no, answer the question. Do you still believe…” Raddatz asked over Trump’s talking.

“Why don’t you interrupt her? You interrupt me all the time,” Trump asked Raddatz, speaking directly at the moderator.

“I do,” Raddatz said.

“Why don’t you interrupt her?” Trump followed up.

The moderators interrupted Trump 26 times—and Clinton only 12 times—a clear and implicit bias by the legacy media anchors.

“Would you please explain whether or not the Muslim ban still stands?” Raddatz interjected again.

“It’s called extreme vetting,” Trump said. He continued:

We are going to areas like Syria where they’re coming in by the tens of thousands because of Barack Obama. And Hillary Clinton wants to allow a 550 percent increase over Obama. People are coming into our country like we have no idea who they are, where they are from, what their feelings about our country is, and she wants 550 percent more. This is going to be the great Trojan horse of all time. We have enough problems in this country. I believe in building safe zones. I believe in having other people pay for them, as an example, the Gulf states, who are not carrying their weight, but they have nothing but money, and take care of people. But I don’t want to have, with all the problems this country has and all of the problems that you see going on, hundreds of thousands of people coming in from Syria when we know nothing about them. We know nothing about their values, and we know nothing about their love for our country.

There were many other moments throughout the debate—from exchanges on Obamacare to more about refugees to dealing with Russia and Syria and even campaign finance—and Trump defeated Clinton on all of them. After the moderators could not stump Trump in the opening, and he steamrolled ahead in the early momentum, she could not catch a break all night.

Trump’s debate victory—which comes after a rough first debate with Clinton back on September 26, an eternity ago in this race, and Indiana Gov. Mike Pence’s win last Tuesday in Virginia in the vice presidential debate against Sen. Tim Kaine (D-VA)—puts perhaps the roughest stretch of his campaign behind him. A videotape of him making lewd remarks about women surfaced on Friday, and jittery establishment Republicans showed initial signs of a full-scale collapse of support for him. That was followed by an apology video late Friday night from Trump, a WikiLeaks document dump of Clinton campaign chairman John Podesta’s personal emails, a rough-and-tumble, but effective, showing from several women who have accused Bill Clinton of allegedly raping or sexually assaulting them, and now this debate performance. With each of those developments and more, Trump seems to have put that stage of the campaign behind him and returned to the offensive position—riding high into political battle—moving into the final month of the campaign.

The videotape threatened to derail Trump’s campaign, as it prompted several senior Republicans to call on him to withdraw and hand the nomination away to his running mate or someone else. Trump has doubled down and refuses to quit on his supporters—and, sure enough, the tape found its way to center stage at the debate’s opening. Trump was pressed on it a whopping six times before he finally—as he hinted he would before the debate when tweeting out video interviews that Bill Clinton’s accusers did with Breitbart News, then appearing with them at an event here in Missouri—lit into Hillary Clinton for enabling Bill Clinton’s behavior.

But not only did Trump survive; he thrived. In the chaotic environment—as he described it as “one on three,” with the moderators working to help Clinton far more than to help him—Trump found his groove again and soared to a much-needed debate victory. The win not only stops the bleeding from a rough patch of the campaign, but propels him forward into the week like a cannonball onto the homestretch, with one final debate to go in Las Vegas a week from Wednesday.

Miller, Trump’s senior communications adviser, noted that Trump does his best with his back against the wall.

“I think Donald Trump loves being the underdog, and this was fantastic,” Miller told Breitbart News. “I think what we saw tonight is a presidential leader in Donald Trump, who stepped up, is ready to lead, and that he’s not going to back down to anybody. Hillary Clinton was rattled—completely rattled—the entire evening. She couldn’t answer on crazy Obamacare. She couldn’t answer on taxes. She couldn’t answer on the emails. You could see everything, from her face was rattled to her inability to give clear answers to the voters who were there. I think if you’re at home and you’re watching, and you think about that person who is out there and what it would look like if she were across the table from a foreign leader, I’d be nervous that she wouldn’t be able to stand up and defend this country. I think one candidate came across as very presidential tonight and that was Donald Trump.”"

Mike Pence courted close to 300 enthusiastic North Carolina voters on Monday in his first campaign event since his running mate, presidential candidate Donald Trump, took on Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton in their second debate of the election season.
Pence offered encouragement to those recovering from Hurricane Matthew, saying, “Our nation is remembering North Carolina, your good Governor Pat McCrory.”

“It’s been an interesting few days,” Pence continued. “I joined the campaign in a heartbeart.”

Pence referred to Sunday night’s debate, calling Trump a fighter and a winner, and declaring, as he has many times before, “He will make America great again.”

“He literally embodies the spirit of America,” Pence said of Trump. “He is willing to fight every day for what he believes in and what makes this nation great.”

Addressing the eleven-year-old video that has been circulating national television and social media, the video for which Trump issued a video apology, Pence said, “It takes a big man to know when he’s wrong and to admit it. … Donald Trump showed last night that he’s a big man.” Pence spoke of his own Christian faith and of those who asked him about it in recent days. He spoke of the high standards to which those who call themselves Christians are called. Pence then added, “We all fall short of the glory of God, and there is no one righteous, other than the One.”

“The other part of my faith is, I believe in grace. I believe in forgiveness,” continued Pence. “We have been forgiven.”

In Pence’s prior acknowledgement of Trump’s apology, he expressed hope that America would see Trump’s heart during the debate. Pence had also said that he was “grateful that he has expressed remorse and apologized to the American people.” He then said he was praying for the Trump family.

On Monday afternoon in Charlotte, Pence told the crowd that during the debate, Trump indeed “showed heart, humility; then he fought back.”

Pence moved on to speak of what the Trump-Pence administration would bring. “This election, it’s not just a choice between two people; it’s a choice between two futures. … I choose a stronger America at home and abroad. … I choose an America that stands up for the constitutional principles.”

He spoke of an all-of-the-above energy strategy that will lead to a more prosperous future. “We’re gonna take the advice of Hillary’s husband,” said Pence, referencing former President Bill Clinton’s statements at a rally, where he called Obamacare crazy. “We’re going to renegotiate NAFTA so it works for the American economy,” said Pence.

Pence went on to say that government wants to be involved in every aspect of our lives.

He pivoted, then, to the Supreme Court, stating that the next president will likely decide the Supreme Court for the next 40 years.

Pence said the U.S. “must decide here and now that the person we elect as the next President of the United States is Donald Trump.” This is essential,” he said, “for sake of the rule of law, the Constitution, life, Second Amendment, right to keep and bear arms.”

“I was awfully proud of my running mate last night,” Pence said, returning to the subject of Sunday night’s debate. He told the crowd that the media continues to ignore the avalanche of corruptions that come out of the Clintons.”

“Donald Trump went out on that stage last night and put the truth before the American people,” Pence said. He then revisited the issues that Clinton’s private foundation took millions from foreign donors as she headed up the State Department, that she destroyed emails from a private server, and her use of high technology to erase emails.

Clinton’s private speeches to foreign financial groups came up, as well. Pence referenced the WikiLeaks release of the emails of John Podesta, a close adviser to President Obama. Podesta was also chief of staff to former President Bill Clinton and current Chairman of Hillary for America. He spoke of the hemispheric market with “Open trade and open borders,” documented in the emails, the accuracy of which the Clinton campaign has not refuted.

Pence spoke of when he first got to know the Trumps during the summer. “To know the Trumps is to know a family,” said Pence.

Pence told the crowd that in Donald Trump and Mike Pence they have two people who will fight every day for the American Dream for everyone in this nation.

“I truly do believe that now is the time to do all that we can,” said Pence, who suggested that those who are inclined could bend a knee and pray for the country.

Clinton and Trump have jockeyed for the advantage, often within the statistical margin of error, in North Carolina polls in the past several months. A Real Clear Politics average of five recent polls gives Clinton the current advantage over Trump by 2.6 percent, in part due to a late September poll that gave her a six-point advantage. The most recent poll included in that average, High Point, showed Clinton up just one point. That poll was taken from October 1-6.

From the Charlotte event, Pence will continue on to hold an evening event in Fletcher, just outside of Asheville. His wife and daughter have joined him along the campaign trail on Monday in North Carolina. "
100474,1002,Exclusive — Excerpt from Ed Klein’s ‘Guilty as Sin’ on Hillary Clinton’s ‘Fatal Flaw’,http://www.breitbart.com/2016-presidential-race/2016/10/10/exclusive-excerpt-ed-kleins-guilty-sin-hillary-clintons-fatal-flaw/,18,"The following excerpt from bestselling author Edward Klein’s new book, Guilty as Sin: Uncovering New Evidence of Corruption and How Hillary Clinton and the Democrats Derailed the FBI Investigation, is from a Chapter titled “Her Fatal Flaw.”
***

Some literary minded observers compare Hillary to Lady Macbeth, whose vaulting ambition led to her downfall.

In Hillary’s case, her fatal flaw is dishonesty. She lies even when she doesn’t have to.

For instance, while campaigning in Iowa, she told a group of supporters that her grandparents were immigrants to the United States.

“All of my grandparents, you know, came over here,” she said. “So I sit here and I think, well you’re talking about the second, third generation. That’s me, that’s you.”

The story was untrue. One of her grandparents was an immigrant; three were not.

Another time Hillary said, “I actually started criticizing the war in Iraq before [Obama] did”—a statement that earned her a Pinocchio for lying from “The Fact Checker” in the Washington Post.

Hillary lied when she said that she “did not mail any classified material to anyone on my email. There is no classified material.” It turned out that there were more than two thousand such documents on her email server—twenty-two of which were marked “special access program,” a level of classification higher than top secret.

She lied when she said that she employed her private email “as a convenience” so that she could use a single phone for both work and personal communications. It turned out that she owned several electronic devices and that, in any case, Huma Abedin carried them for her.

She lied when she said she had voluntarily turned over all her work emails to the State Department. It turned out that she relinquished those emails only when forced to under subpoena, and that she withheld dozens of Benghazi-related emails she had exchanged with her back-channel fixer Sidney Blumenthal.

“Clinton has repeated numerous times that the [email] arrangement was ‘allowed,’ though no one in the administration has ever said they approved her server,” wrote The Hill’s A. B. Stoddard. “So Democrats—like Republicans—assume she is making a misleading statement about her own unorthodox decision to do something no Cabinet secretary had ever done before.”

She lied when, according to the New York Times, she told the FBI that former Secretary of State Colin Powell had advised her to conduct unclassified state business using a private email account. Powell, one of the most respected elder statesmen in the country, quickly denied the report. “Her people have been trying to pin it on me,” he said. “The truth is, she was using [the private email server] for a year before I sent her a memo telling her what I did.”

Hillary lied when she said that as secretary of state she did not grant special favors to foreigners who donated money to the Clinton Foundation. As I documented with eyewitness accounts in Unlikeable: The Problem with Hillary, wealthy foreign donors who gave millions to the foundation received special treatment. One such donor was a Canadian businessman who was granted permission to sell control of 20 percent of America’s uranium production capacity to Vladimir Putin’s Russia. After the deal went through, Bill Clinton was invited to Moscow to give a speech. He was paid $500,000.

“The Clinton Foundation was ostensibly set up to solve the world’s most pressing problems,” writes David Harsanyi, senior editor at The Federalist. “Although it has done some fine work, it’s most fruitful program has been leveraging [Hillary] Clinton’s position in the State Department to enrich her family, friends and cronies. The foundation was a center of influence peddling. Rock stars. Soccer players. Conglomerates. Crown princes. All of them paid in. All of them expected access to the U.S. government.” And most of them got it.

Indeed, more than half of the private citizens who were granted access to Hillary while she was at Foggy Bottom—85 out of the 154 who got face time or spoke to her—donated to the foundation, for a total of $156 million.

The membrane that should have prevented seepage between the State Department and the foundation turned out to be totally permeable. “Laura Graham, a senior executive at the foundation,” reported the New York Post, left almost 150 telephone messages over two years for Cheryl Mills, Hillary’s chief of staff.” And when Mills wasn’t taking telephone calls from Graham and doing favors for foundation donors, she was traveling to New York City to interview job candidates for a top job at the foundation.

The impact of Hillary’s menagerie of lies was reflected in public opinion polls. Sixty percent of Americans considered her “untrustworthy.” And when Gallup asked Americans what word came to mind when they heard the name “Hillary Clinton,” a majority replied “dishonest/liar/don’t trust her/poor character.”

To deal with this problem, her friends and campaign staffers set about trying to make Hillary more likeable.

“She needs to try to humanize herself, because in some ways she’s kind of become a cardboard cutout figure,” said liberal historian Douglas Brinkley.

But rehabilitating Hillary at this stage in her life (she turns sixty-nine on October 26) was more easily said than done.

“Hillary still obsesses about money, a narrative thread that has existed since she was thwarted in her desire to build a pool at the governor’s mansion in poor Arkansas and left the White House with a doggie bag full of sofas, rugs, lamps, TVs and china, some of which the Clintons later had to pay for or return,” writes New York Times columnist Maureen Dowd. “Even Chelsea was cashing in, getting a ridiculous, $600,000-a-year scion salary from NBC, far greater than that of many of the network’s correspondents. As a Clinton White House aide once explained to me, ‘Hillary, though a Methodist, thinks of herself like an Episcopal bishop who deserves to live at the level of her wealthy parishioners, in return for devoting herself to God and good works.’”

And the social critic Camille Paglia puts it this way: “So much must be overlooked or discounted—from Hillary’s compulsive money-lust and her brazen indifference to normal rules to her conspiratorial use of shadowy surrogates and her sociopathic shape-shifting in policy positions for momentary expedience.”"
100475,1003,2016 Electoral Math — Clinton Continues Her Rise,http://www.huffingtonpost.com/chris-weigant/2016-electoral-math----cl_b_12435864.html?utm_hp_ref=politics,18,"I have to begin today with a rather large caveat: nothing in this article deals with what has happened since Friday. Polling always lags reality, meaning that the effect of the Billy Bush/Donald Trump tape and the second debate are not reflected in today’s data one tiny bit. That’ll all show up in the next week, so you’ll just have to check back next Monday to see how all of it turns out. For now, we’re dealing with what happened before that tape hit the airwaves last Friday afternoon — which largely consisted of the public’s reaction to Donald Trump’s tax returns being leaked (showing an almost $1 billion loss in a single year). So just to be crystal clear: nothing in this article will reflect the reaction to the Bush/Trump tape, or last night’s debate.

Even with that big caveat, Hillary Clinton had another good week in the polls. In fact, almost all the news was good news for Clinton and bad news for Donald Trump. Clinton continued to ride the wave from the first debate, and this week shows the public’s reaction to Trump’s tax returns being leaked, showing an almost-billion-dollar loss in a single year (so much for the “I’m a great businessman” thing...). Trump is defiant about not paying any federal income taxes for almost two decades, which certainly didn’t help him any with public opinion.

Let’s take a look at our first chart, which shows how the candidates would do in overall Electoral Votes (EV), if the election were held today and the polls were all correct. Hillary (blue) starts from the bottom, and Trump (red) starts from the top. The white gaps are states which are perfectly tied. Whichever candidate crosses the middle line has enough Electoral College votes to win. Hillary Clinton has almost completely regained the lead she held in mid-August. Percentage-wise, Clinton now holds 65 percent of the Electoral College, to Trump’s 35 percent. This is up from last week’s 60/40 split, and is very close to a whopping 2-to-1 advantage for Clinton in the Electoral College.

For the second week in a row, Clinton held onto every state she had last week, and flipped two more states into her column: Arizona and Ohio. The momentum she saw last week continued, to put it another way. I should mention that Ohio moved around quite a bit this week (more on this in a moment), but in terms of this particular chart, Ohio spent a single day being tied, which is why there’s that small patch of white between the candidates.

Things look even better for Clinton when you dive down into each candidate’s relative strength in the states they currently hold, as well. Let’s take a look at Trump’s chart first, to see this movement. As always, the categories used are from the same Electoral-Vote.com site I use to get all my raw data. Donald Trump actually began this period with a little good news, but this didn’t last long. By the end of the week, he was starting to see states flip over to Hillary Clinton.

Ohio is running polls almost constantly, at this point. Trump got one good poll early in the week which moved Ohio from Barely Trump to Weak Trump, which was a shot in the arm for him. But a few days later, Ohio fell back to Barely Trump and then over the weekend moved all the way to Barely Clinton. Since Ohio has 18 EV, this was very noticeable in the graph. Trump also lost Arizona to Clinton, which is the other step down his overall numbers took (Arizona only has 11 EV, so this wasn’t as pronounced as the Ohio shift). To recap: the only good news Trump got this week turned into bad news for him in the end.

Overall, Trump did stay remarkably stable in both his Strong and Weak categories. Strong Trump started at 87 EV and didn’t budge an inch all week long. Weak Trump started at 78 EV, briefly rose to 96 EV with the addition of Ohio, but then fell back to the same 78 EV it started with. So the silver lining (flimsy though it may be) for Trump was that he halted the slide in his base states. He didn’t improve here, mind you, but he didn’t lose any ground either.

The Barely Trump category saw a lot more movement. Trump started with 50 EV in Barely, which fell to 32 EV and then returned to 50 EV when Ohio briefly firmed up for him. But then Trump lost Arizona and Ohio entirely, leaving him with only 21 EV at the end. That’s a loss of 29 EV, which Trump can’t really afford to lose at this point in the race.

Overall, Trump started the week with a total of 215 EV, which fell to only 186 EV. That’s the lowest he’s been since August 22, to put this in perspective. Trump is now only 22 EV above his lowest point ever, to put it in even more perspective. And that’s all before last Friday’s revelations, I remind everyone.

Of course, the number I keep the closest track of is “Strong Plus Weak” because this shows the states a candidate can truly count on when people vote — states where they’re up by five points or better in the polls. Trump’s Strong Plus Weak number started at 165 EV, rose briefly with the addition of Ohio to 183 EV, but then fell back to the same 165 EV he started the week with. So the week didn’t hurt Trump with his base, but he also failed to expand this base at all.

OK, enough of Trump — let’s take a look at Hillary Clinton’s chart, which is much more positive this week. Hillary Clinton has now almost completely recovered from the polling dip she experienced at the end of September. Clinton saw nine states shift around this week, and of these only two weren’t good news. Both New Hampshire and Wisconsin tightened up with new polls, and fell back from Weak Clinton to only Barely Clinton. But the good news from the other seven states more than made up for this.

Three states made the opposite shift, firming up from Barely Clinton to Weak Clinton. Colorado, New Mexico, and Pennsylvania all made this shift, and while Colorado and New Mexico are good news, the best news for Clinton fans is seeing Pennsylvania moving to the point where few are even calling it a battleground state anymore. This is important, because Trump’s supposed path to victory was supposed to start by flipping Pennsylvania. This now looks increasingly unlikely to happen.

Within the states Clinton already had, she got even better news from two other states. Washington state moved from Weak Clinton back to Strong Clinton (where it should have been, all along), but the biggest news was Rhode Island moving all the way from Barely Clinton to Strong Clinton. Both of these are states that have (historically) consistently voted Democratic, so neither was any big surprise, but it is nice to see stronger polling numbers in both of them.

But the best news for Clinton was flipping both Arizona and Ohio from Barely Trump to Barely Clinton. To be sure, neither one is exactly a lock for Clinton at this point, and either or both could flip back just as easily with another round of polling. While Ohio is the perennial battleground state, it is indeed remarkable that Arizona is even in play for Democrats. Of the last six presidential elections, Arizona has only voted Democratic once (for Bill Clinton in 1996), so it would be nothing short of astonishing to see Clinton win the state.

Overall, Clinton had a great week, rising from a total of 323 EV to hit an impressive 352 EV by the end of the week. This puts her right back in the territory she occupied in mid-August, and only 16 EV shy of her best-ever showing.

Breaking things down by category, Clinton improved her Strong numbers with the addition of Rhode Island and Washington state, moving from 152 EV up to 168 EV. This number still has a long way to go before it regains the strength Clinton showed in August, however, but at least it is now moving in the right direction — up 36 EV from her low point a few weeks ago.

In the Weak category, Clinton began by rising from 79 EV up to 113 EV, with the addition of Colorado and New Mexico. This fell back by week’s end to only 87 EV, with some of the losses moving up to Strong and some down to Barely.

By the numbers, Clinton’s Barely didn’t change much, but there was a lot of reshuffling. Clinton started with 92 EV in the Barely category, slipped back to 58 EV but then rose at the end (with Ohio’s 18 EV) to finish at 97 EV — five more than she started with.

The really good news for Clinton came in the Strong Plus Weak category, though. Clinton added four states to her total here (Colorado, New Mexico, Pennsylvania, Rhode Island) and only lost two (New Hampshire and Wisconsin). This meant adding 38 EV while subtracting 14 EV, for an overall gain of 24 EV. Clinton started the period with 231 EV in Strong Plus Weak, rose to 265 EV, but then fell back at the very end (with the loss of Wisconsin to Barely), to 255 EV. This puts her only 15 EV away from victory, in Strong Plus Weak alone. That is rather impressive, although still off from August’s highs (she hit 320 EV for almost a week here, in late August).

Let’s put this into historical perspective with our occasional chart which tracks how Hillary Clinton is doing in Strong Plus Weak measured against how Barack Obama did in 2008 and 2012. As you can easily see, the positions are comparable.  Clinton’s Strong Plus Weak ratings have bounced around more than Obama saw in either of his campaigns, and Clinton’s highest point has already topped Obama’s high in 2008. Clinton’s low also never sank to where Obama dipped to in 2008 as well. What’s interesting is that Obama’s 2008 recovery is so far close to matching Clinton’s recovery this year. A few days ago, they were almost a perfect match. Clinton was at 265 EV (until today), while Obama was at 264 EV in 2008, and 257 EV in 2012. The reason I decided to run this chart again is that this was the point where Obama’s trendlines diverged, rising in 2008 to an easy win, but falling in 2012 to a much closer victory over Mitt Romney. Will Clinton follow one of these paths, or one somewhere in between? Well, considering what happened Friday, the safer bet would probably be that Clinton follows Obama’s 2008 rise for the next week or so.

 

My Picks

Moving right along, let’s get away from pure polling analysis and add in gut feelings, for how I now see the race. Here is my new map of how I’m rating all the states, broken down into Safe, Probable, and Lean for both candidates, as well as Too Close To Call for those where I have no firm idea which way the wind is currently blowing. So here’s my map for this week, courtesy (as always) of the folks at 270toWin, where you can make a map of your own picks, if you feel so inclined. Likely States — Clinton

Safe Clinton (15 states, 192 EV)

Clinton added one state to her Safe category this week, as Rhode Island moves up from Probable Clinton. Rhode Island is one of those states that isn’t polled all that much, meaning one outlier poll can throw things off much more than, say, Ohio or Florida. There was one poll showing Rhode Island much closer than it likely actually is, a few weeks ago, but recent polling has put Hillary back with a comfortable lead.

Probable Clinton (7 states, 76 EV)

There was a goodly amount of activity in the Probable Clinton category, but most of it was good news for Clinton. Rhode Island moved up to Safe Clinton, and (the only bad news) New Hampshire moved down to just Leans Clinton. These two states were replaced by both Colorado and Pennsylvania moving up to Probable from Leans Clinton. In both Colorado and Pennsylvania, Hillary’s poll numbers are getting noticeably better, and her lead is widening, so they have to be seen as stronger than just Leans at this point.

 

Likely States — Trump

Safe Trump (16 states, 93 EV)

Trump lost one state here this week, as I had to move Indiana down to just Probable Trump. This was largely a gut-feelings move, since the polling hasn’t really shifted at all. But Trump has never held an insurmountable lead in the Hoosier State, and what with all the turmoil it could conceivably come into play in the next few weeks. So, for now, Indiana moves down.

Probable Trump (5 states, 78 EV)

Other than Indiana moving down here, the rest of the Probable Trump category stayed the same this week. So far (and remember, this is before last Friday’s bombshell and before the debate), Trump seems to be doing a fairly good job of holding onto his core states. The problem for him is, they don’t add up to anywhere near what he needs to win.

 

Tossup States

Leans Clinton (2 states, 22 EV)

As happened last week, this category completely changed, as both states previously in Leans Clinton moved up to Probable Clinton, to be replaced by one state moving down from Probable Clinton (New Hampshire), and one state moving up from Too Close To Call (Ohio). Both of these moves are debatable, of course. New Hampshire saw one weak poll for Clinton — she’s still leading, but not by much. If it’s an outlier and a future poll shows a bigger lead for her, then it could move right back up to Probable Clinton, but for now it has to be considered only a Leans Clinton state. Ohio is even more debatable, since it has been very close for quite some time now, and Trump had been leading in the polls up until very recently. Call this one a gut-feelings move if you will, but I feel that the momentum in Ohio has shifted in Hillary’s favor. I could be wrong and it could move right back down to Too Close To Call, but for now I’m considering it a Leans Clinton state.

Leans Trump (2 states plus one district, 16 EV)

Trump had a more stable time of it in the Leans Trump category, losing one state but seeing the others stay put. Arizona moved down to Too Close To Call, as a recent poll showed Clinton taking the lead there. Iowa and South Carolina stayed Leans Trump, as did the Maine district (with a single EV) where Trump still probably has an edge.

Too Close To Call (4 states, 61 EV)

We’ve got four states in Too Close To Call, but they’re not the same four as last week. Ohio moved up to Leans Clinton, and Arizona moved down from Leans Trump to replace it. The other three states (Florida, Nevada, North Carolina) remained complete tossups, though. Florida may be stuck here for weeks, because accurate polling may take some time to happen as the state’s east coast recovers from the hurricane (making accurate polling difficult if not impossible, since many people have other things to do right now than answer pollsters’ calls). Nevada and North Carolina both might be considered Leans Clinton, as she’s been leading for a while, but her lead is still razor-thin in both places, so I’ve decided to keep them here for now.

 

Final Tally

Hillary Clinton continued to improve in the aftermath of the first debate, adding one state to her total Likely Clinton states (Safe and Probable combined), putting 22 states in her pocket for Election Day. While adding one state isn’t that impressive, her rise in the Electoral College count was more so, as she moved up from 243 EV here last week to 268 EV this week — a gain of 25 EV in a single week. This puts her only 2 EV short of winning, without even counting any of her Leans Clinton states or the true tossups. Clinton only has to add one state (any state) to her Likely Clinton totals to put her over the top, and put this election out of reach for Donald Trump. That’s a pretty good place to be, one month out from the voting.

Donald Trump didn’t lose any states from his Likely column, which is about the best news he could have hoped for, at this point. He still has the same 21 states here, with the same total of 171 EV between them. Once again, this leaves him a whopping 99 EV shy of victory.

The gap between the two candidates grew larger this week in the EV count. Last week, Clinton was ahead by 72 EV in the Likely states category, but this week, she’s jumped ahead to a 97 EV lead over Trump.

Only eight states can be considered tossups this week, down one state from last week. Clinton has two states in her Leans column, for a total of 22 EV. Even if she just wins New Hampshire’s 4 EV (and all her Likely states), she will be over the 270 EV mark, and she will be our next president. If she wins both her Leans states, she’ll be at 290 EV without any of the Too Close To Call states at all. This is a much better place for her to be than last week, when she would have needed both her Leans states to win.

Trump has only two states leaning in his direction this week (plus that single district in Maine). This only adds up to 16 EV, down from 27 EV here last week. Adding together Trump’s Likely states and his leaners only gives him 187 EV, down 11 EV from last week. This means not only would he have to win all the Too Close To Call states, he would also have to wrest both New Hampshire and Ohio from Clinton to win. That’s a pretty steep hill to climb, to put it mildly.

Four states are too close to accurately make any predictions at all. Clinton is actually polling ahead in all four states (Arizona, Florida, Nevada, and North Carolina) right now, but by very small margins. Any of these states could flip back to Trump at any moment, in other words. Due to the double-digit nature of three of these states, they add up to a substantial 61 EV between them.

I would remind everyone once again that this is a snapshot in time taken before last Friday’s news hit and also before the second debate. Call it a benchmark to measure next week’s polls against. But even before the fallout hits from the Billy Bush bombshell videotape, Hillary Clinton is getting very close to clinching the entire race. All she needs from the eight states that are still close is a paltry 2 EV to win. She’s got many paths to get there (eight, in fact).

With one month to go, Hillary Clinton is on the brink of putting the race away. This is not unprecedented — Barack Obama managed the same feat this far out from the election in 2008. Trump would have to mount the biggest comeback in political history to even have a shot at winning, at this point. And that’s before the polls start reflecting that leaked video. Next week is certainly going to be fun for poll-watchers everywhere, that is absolutely certain.

100476,1003,Trump - The Horror Movie,http://www.huffingtonpost.com/sherman-yellen/trump-the-horror-movie_b_12432144.html?utm_hp_ref=politics,18,"I don’t know about you, but I found that so-called town hall debate the most difficult one to watch. I knew that there was no such thing as a knockout blow that would remove Trump from his place as GOP nominee. It is one reason I don’t go to horror movies - for although I do know as an adult that “its only a movie” they reduce me to a frightened child again - afraid of the monster who always gets that last chance to strike a mortal blow at the innocent who is bound to appear and place him/herself in harm’s way. Trump is the ultimate slasher movie.

Trump is structured like the last act of every horror movie - just when you think your are safe, the monster rises from the grave and comes at you with his blood-spattered axe (or if you prefer ax) or his untrimmed fingernails made of steel. His lumbering gait, his slits that serve as hoods for his scavanger eyes, his malign mouth that looks like it will not be satisfied until it eats the baby. He is the fully equipped B-movie monster - our very own Trumpenstein.

I knew that Trump would use all of Bill’s real and alleged sexual escapades to justify his own so-called locker room talk, despite the fact that this was HRC not Bill Clinton who was opposing him. Clearly, if Trump had murdered a group of innocents he would look astonished when caught - “But hell, officer, the Manson family did it, and Ted Bundy and...” as he tried to smear Soros and Warren Buffet for their taxes - the loopholes they used - possibly true, but like everything he said on stage - he did not have a shred of evidence. What evidence did he produce that would justify his threat to imprison Hillary? Ah, those emails which were bleached to remove the bloodstains on them. Alas, he needed his Nuremberg rally of supporters to follow up with their “Lock her up!” to get the full effect - but just saying it in this debate - threatening to imprison his opponent - showed us that there is an enemies list being prepared - the fascist must have his revenge.

Did it work? All the accusations and threats? Hillary fended off the blows and did a good, if measured, job of repelling his attacks. I am sure it did Trump good among the true Trump supporters - who - having committed themselves to him - can justify his hatred and objectification of women as boy talk, locker room banter, and hunger for the red meat of the latest verbal kill. All it lacked was the snapping towel and the smelly sneakers. It just added another layer of disgust for me - for this man who is incapable of being responsible for any of his own acts yet wants to be put in charge of the welfare of our families and our world.

I would like to believe that Hillary “won” the night - but there is no winning or losing with Trump. Like the movie monster a sequel is already being prepared. “Bride of Trumpenstein” - or “Trumpenstein meets Abbot and Costello” - if you rather “Jaws 12” - just when you thought it was safe to watch a debate again he rises from the waters and...” With the holiday almost upon us we might even call it “Halloween at Mar-a-lago.” We now know that even his loss in the election will not silence him. As he sits in the wreckage of his Trump empire - that stage set that allowed him to perform for millions - he will be plotting new conspiracies - spewing out more hatred for HRC and for anyone who opposed him. It will all become so familiar that people will cease to listen when this sore loser becomes the bore loser of all time. Be brave, Little Sherman, the horror movie is nearly over. But oh, what a price this country is paying for the ticket to see it."
100477,1003,Is This America?,http://www.huffingtonpost.com/stephanie-mitchell-hughes/is-this-america_b_12424568.html?utm_hp_ref=politics,18,"“I question America. Is this America, the land of the free and the home of the brave, where we have to sleep with out (sic) telephones off the hooks because our lives be threatened daily, because we want to live as decent human beings, in America?” Fannie Lou Hamer, Mississippi Civil Rights Activist at the 1964 Democratic National Convention

The 2016 election cycle in the United States has been protracted, hostile, and ranged from merely discordant to bizarre. The level of xenophobia, misogyny, and racial hatred so openly expressed without conscience is utterly breathtaking. It is all reminiscent of the paralyzing terror that African Americans endured for a century following the abrupt end of the Reconstruction Era in the late 1800s. While not remotely as harsh, there are parallels between the experiences of African Americans over the century following the Reconstruction Era and that of disenfranchised communities during the 2016 election. Against this backdrop, I believe that the 2016 Presidential Election is probably more important than the historic 2008 and 2012 elections of President Obama.

As an African American mother parenting alone without support, I am more concerned about the 2016 election than any since I cast my first vote in November 1980. While I strongly disagreed with the policies of Presidents Reagan, George H.W. Bush, and George W. Bush, I was confident that they all respected and understood the gravity of the office. In this presidential election, one candidate’s daily meltdowns and out of control machinations have caused me to fear for my and my children’s personal safety and security. As a United States citizen in 2016, I should not have to fear for my family’s personal safety.

While less now than in earlier generations, single mothers, particularly those of color, are still stigmatized. Despite our increased numbers, it is rare for politicians at any level to craft a policy agenda focused on the “kitchen table” issues that affect the lives of single mothers and their children. These kitchen table issues include equal pay, reasonable leave policies, access to excellent child care, affordable housing, safe neighborhoods, well resourced schools and educational opportunities, and comprehensive health care.

That said, there are three kitchen table issues that are of paramount importance to me as a single mother in this election season. The first issue concerns the overuse of deadly force by police against African Americans. Quite frankly, I no longer have the mental capacity to absorb the gut wrenching pain that occurs each time an African American man, woman, or child is killed by police. It should be noted that I have condemned the senseless murders of police officers like those in Dallas who were simply trying to protect and serve. That said, I have a young adult son and teenage daughter. They have never been arrested or in trouble with the police. Both are honors students and my son will graduate from college in December. He defies every stereotype and statistic associated with African American males. I am exhausted with worry that my brilliant children will have an unfortunate encounter with police and never come home again. All of this saddens me because I represented police for several years. I know first hand that policing is an incredibly difficult job. I gained tremendous respect for the police officers who I represented because they conducted themselves as professionals. However, I believe that law enforcement must first “police” itself and prune the bad apples weighing down its departmental tree. These bad apples are not necessarily bad people. They just may not possess the temperament needed to be a good police officer. Implicit bias and racism are cancerous metastatic tumors that have destroyed the relationships between police departments and the communities of color they serve. Policing practices must be dramatically reformed. Business as usual over policing and unchecked deadly force is destroying our country. I do not want my own children to be innocent casualties of a practice that they did not start.

I am a single mother living with depression. As such, my second kitchen table issue is the need for comprehensive mental health care that includes a plan to address the scarcity of psychiatrists and advanced nurse practitioners. The nationwide shortage of psychiatrists and advanced nurse practitioners to manage medications has reached critical mass. It has been nearly impossible to find a psychiatrist or advanced nurse practitioner to regularly evaluate my medications to ensure that they still effectively treat my depression. I am not alone. There are literally thousands of individuals living with a mental illness across the United States facing this same dilemma. As a solo mom parenting without support, my children need me to be both mentally and physically healthy. Comprehensive mental health care will allow my children to have and see the very best of me.

My final kitchen table issue, the right to vote, is my personal holy grail. The right to vote is sacrosanct. It gives me a voice at the table and makes my other kitchen table issues possible. As such I am passionate about protecting the voting rights of African Americans. The full frontal attack on the voting rights of African Americans only accelerated after President Obama’s first election in 2008. In June 2013, the United States Supreme Court issued its landmark decision in Shelby County, Alabama v. Holder, Attorney General et al 570 U.S. _ (2013) hereinafter Shelby. Prior to the Shelby decision, specifically identified states and cities with a history of racial discrimination were required to submit all proposed changes in voting laws to the federal government for “preclearance” meaning review and approval before the law could be implemented. The Shelby decision eliminated the preclearance requirement which allowed states with a history of discrimination to immediately enact or implement voting laws without federal oversight. For example, in the wake of Shelby, states like North Carolina and Texas immediately moved to implement strict photo identification requirements, reduced the amount of time allowed or precincts available for early voting, and made it more difficult to register to vote. The virtual patchwork quilt of laws that have been enacted across the United States have the potential to generate so much confusion that certain groups will not bother to vote this November. Such an untenable result is antithetical in a nation founded on the principles of liberty, justice, and freedom for all people. So, it now falls to me and others who “hold these truths to be self-evident” to educate and equip single mothers, African Americans, and other disenfranchised groups to bring their collective voices to the table by exercising the right to vote.

Though daunting and at times discouraging, this critical work continues. In the words of my Spelman Sister, Dr. Bernice Johnson Reagon “We who believe in freedom cannot rest.”"
100478,1004,Trump Warns He'll Keep Going After Clintons Over '90s Sex Scandals,http://talkingpointsmemo.com/livewire/donald-trump-attacks-hillary-clinton-bill-indiscretions-pennsylvania-rally,18,"Donald Trump renewed his attacks on Hillary Clinton for her husband’s extramarital affairs on Monday, saying she allowed him to “take advantage” of women.

“For decades Hillary Clinton has been deeply familiar with her husband's predatory behavior and instead of trying to stop it, she made it possible for him to take advantage of even more women,” Trump told supporters at a rally in Ambridge, Pennsylvania, saying Clinton put women “in harm’s way.”

“She is a total hypocrite,” he went on. “The hypocrisy of the media and our politicians is hard to believe.”

Trump’s campaign paid to have three women who have accused Bill Clinton of sexual misconduct sit in the audience at Sunday’s debate, where the Republican nominee expounded on his claim that his Democratic opponent was an enabler of her husband while standing on the stage beside her.

Trump signaled on Monday that he would continue to employ this strategy if the Clinton campaign continued to bring up a newly leaked 2005 tape in which Trump himself once made predatory comments bragging about grabbing women “by the pussy.”

""I was getting beaten up for 72 hours on all the networks for inappropriate words 12 years ago, locker room talk, whatever you want to call it,"" Trump told the audience. ""But I said to myself, wait a minute—I just said very inappropriate words—but Bill Clinton sexually assaulted innocent women and Hillary Clinton attacked those women viciously.""

""If they want to release more tapes saying inappropriate things, we will continue to talk about Bill and Hillary Clinton doing inappropriate things,"" Trump warned.

At Sunday’s second presidential debate, Clinton said, “It's clear to anyone who heard it that it represents exactly what he is.”"
100479,1004,Pence Publicly Defends Trump: Debate Performance Showed 'He's A Big Man',http://talkingpointsmemo.com/livewire/mike-pence-defends-big-man-trump-charlotte-rally,18,"Indiana Gov. Mike Pence (R) made his first campaign appearance in defense of his embattled running mate on Monday, taking the stage at a rally in Charlotte, North Carolina, to claim that Donald Trump “literally embodies the spirit of America.”

“It’s been an interesting few days,” Pence said at the start of the event, nodding to the turmoil unleashed by a 2005 video obtained by the Washington Post that showed Trump bragging about groping women without their consent.

“But I’ve got to tell you, I joined this campaign in a heartbeat because you have nominated a man for president who never quits,” Pence went on, according to Yahoo News. “He is a fighter. He is a winner and we will make America great again.”

The Indiana governor initially laid low after the tape was published, calling Trump’s comments indefensible and saying he would “pray” for his running mate’s family. Reports indicated that Pence was waiting to see how Trump did in Sunday’s second presidential debate before deciding how to proceed.

If his speech in Chatlotte was any indication, Pence seemed to think Trump’s performance was a slam dunk.

“You know, it takes a big man to know when he’s wrong, and to admit it, and have the humility to apologize, and be transparent and be vulnerable,” Pence said, according to Yahoo. “And Donald Trump last night showed that he’s a big man.”

Pence’s praise comes as House Speaker Paul Ryan (R-WI) reportedly told his own party members to focus on their own races ahead of Election Day, while reassuring them he would not rescind his endorsement of Trump. The real estate mogul fired back on Twitter, telling Ryan to stop “fighting the Republican nominee.”

Pence did not comment on the backlash from fellow Republicans, instead pointing to his evangelical faith as the reason he personally felt able to forgive Trump’s remarks.

“We all fall short of the glory of God,” he said, according to Yahoo. “There’s no one righteous other than the one. As I said last weekend, I don’t condone what was said and I spoke out against it, but the other part of my faith is, I believe in grace.”"
100480,1004,Ryan Tells House GOP He Will Not Revoke His Trump Endorsement,http://talkingpointsmemo.com/livewire/ryan-tells-gop-he-s-sticking-with-trump-for-now,18,"House Speaker Paul Ryan (R-WI) told his rank and file members on a conference call Monday that he is going to continue to support Donald Trump for president, but that he will not campaign with him.

Ryan told fellow Republicans about his decision in a conference call that was scheduled after a 2005 tape surfaced that included Trump crudely discussing how he grabbed women by the genitals.

According to a member who spoke with TPM on the condition of background, NRCC Chairman Greg Walden (R-OR) warned members that things were not moving in their direction at the moment. Ryan said it had been a turbulent month and that members should feel free to do what they thought was best to save their seats.

Ryan received criticism from members who accused him of wrongly ceding the election to Hillary Clinton, the member said. Rep. Dana Rohrabacher (R-CA) expressed a strong rebuke of Ryan,"" the member told TPM. Rohrabacher said he was dissapointed with the speaker for not doubling down on Trump. In all, the member said seven or eight Republicans spoke on the call to say they wanted the party to embrace Trump despite the tape.

Ryan reportedly had to get back on the call to reiterate his position that he was not actually unendorsing Trump.

After the tape came out, Ryan disinvited Trump from attending a rally in Wisconsin, which was supposed to be their first joint appearance together. Ryan reportedly told members that for the next month, he is going to be spending his time ensuring that his members win their re-elections and that each member should decide how best they can do that in their districts. Just a few hours later, Trump took a swipe at Ryan. "
100481,1005,Mike Pence Insists He and Trump Totally Agree on Syria,http://www.motherjones.com/politics/2016/10/trump-pence-woolsey-syria-aleppo,18,"On Sunday night, Donald Trump made headlines by saying he disagreed with Mike Pence on Syria. By Monday morning, the Trump campaign was desperately insisting there was no disagreement at all.

At last week's vice presidential debate, Pence stunned viewers by saying that Russia is helping the Syrian government kill civilians in Aleppo—and that the United States should be ready to use force against the Syrian regime. It was a sharp turn away from Trump's previous comments, in which the real estate mogul has praised Syria and Russia for allegedly attacking ISIS.

""He and I haven't spoken, and I disagree. I disagree.""
At Sunday's presidential debate, it was Trump's turn to contradict Pence. ""He and I haven't spoken, and I disagree. I disagree,"" Trump replied icily when asked about Pence's comments. ""I think you have to knock out ISIS.""

The contrast was obvious, but now Pence and Trump are pretending it never happened.

Pence appeared on all the major cable news networks Monday morning and claimed that ABC's Martha Raddatz, who co-moderated Sunday's debate, had ""mischaracterized"" his position on Syria. Pence said last week that ""if Russia chooses to be involved…in this barbaric attack on civilians in Aleppo, the United States of America should be prepared to use military force to strike military targets of the Assad regime to prevent them from this humanitarian crisis that is taking place in Aleppo."" On Monday, he claimed his statement had been narrowly focused on Aleppo and that Raddatz had wrongly implied he wanted take on Syria and Russia in general. ""The way Martha presented that question last night was to suggest that Russian provocation broadly and that of the Assad regime should be met with military force,"" he said on MSNBC. In fact, during Sunday's debate, Raddatz asked both Clinton and Trump specifically about the crisis in Aleppo. ""If you were president, what would you do about Syria and the humanitarian crisis in Aleppo?"" Raddatz asked Trump. Immediately after saying that, Raddatz described Pence's comments nearly verbatim: ""And I want to remind you what your running mate said. He said provocations by Russia need to be met with American strength and that if Russia continues to be involved in airstrikes along with the Syrian government forces of Assad, the United States of America should be prepared to use military force to strike the military targets of the Assad regime.""

Trump then said twice that he and Pence disagreed. Trump went on to falsely suggest that Aleppo ""basically has fallen."" He also praised the Syrian government's alleged actions against ISIS. ""Right now, Syria is fighting ISIS,"" he said. That claim is also false: The Syrian government and its allies, including Russia, have overwhelmingly attacked rebel groups and civilians rather than ISIS. In fact, the Syrian regime abetted the rise of ISIS and has even struck oil deals with the terrorist group.

Pence isn't the only member of the Trump campaign struggling to answer questions about the GOP candidate's disagreement on Aleppo. Former CIA Director James Woolsey, a national security adviser to the Trump campaign, was asked on CNN Monday what the campaign's policy on Syria actually is. Woolsey refused to even answer the question.

""But, wait, Mr. Director,"" said Kate Bolduan, a CNN anchor who was visibly baffled by Woolsey's attempts to dodge the issue. ""You're the former CIA director. You're a national security adviser to the Donald Trump campaign. When it comes to a key policy position that you would assume would be a unified position of the campaign, I would also assume you would know what it is and be able to voice it.""

""I'm not telling you one way or the other,"" Woolsey replied. ""The candidates are the ones who are going to communicate the policy decisions to the public, not me."" "
100482,1005,Top Republican Spokesman Thinks Pussy Grabbing Might Not Be Assault,http://www.motherjones.com/politics/2016/10/gop-spokesman-doesnt-know-if-grabbing-genitals-sexual-assault,18,"Sean Spicer, a top Republican National Committee official, on Sunday night refused to acknowledge that the conduct Donald Trump claimed to have engaged in during a 2005 Access Hollywood taping constitutes sexual assault. In that video, which has roiled the GOP since its release Friday afternoon by the Washington Post, Trump discussed forcibly kissing women and grabbing their genitals. ""Grab them by the pussy,"" Trump said. ""You can do anything."" In the days since, the press has referred to what Trump described as sexual assault. Trump's shocking comments caused women around the country to come forward with their own stories of being assaulted in this way on social media and in the press—describing it repeatedly as a violent form of sexual assault that still haunts them.

But Spicer, the RNC's communications director, refused to acknowledge that grabbing someone's genitals is sexual assault when asked about this by The Weekly Standard after Sunday's debate. ""I don't know,"" he said. ""I'm not a lawyer.""

The answer sounds a lot like Republican Sen. Marco Rubio when he once dodged a question about how old the planet is by saying, ""I'm not a scientist, man."" Except Spicer is talking about sexual assault—and trying to minimize the definition and experiences of the people subjected to it. Perhaps Politico reporter Edward-Isaac Dovere said it best: Spicer isn't the only Trump supporter trying to claim that what Trump described is not sexual assault. Sen. Jeff Sessions (R-Ala.) also denied that groping someone's genitals is sexual assault. Here is Sessions' exchange with The Weekly Standard:

SESSIONS: This was very improper language, and he's acknowledged that.

TWS: But beyond the language, would you characterize the behavior described in that [video] as sexual assault if that behavior actually took place?

SESSIONS: I don't characterize that as sexual assault. I think that's a stretch. I don't know what he meant—

TWS: So if you grab a woman by the genitals, that's not sexual assault?

SESSIONS: I don't know. It's not clear that he—how that would occur.

Unlike Spicer, Sessions is a lawyer—one who's nomination to a federal judgeship three decades ago capsized after critics accused him of racism. "
100483,1005,Paul Ryan Won't Defend Donald Trump—But Is Still Endorsing Him,http://www.motherjones.com/politics/2016/10/paul-ryan-donald-trump,18,"Over the weekend dozens of Republicans condemned and abandoned Donald Trump, but Paul Ryan still seems to be hedging his bets. The House Speaker convened a conference call with Republicans in his caucus Monday morning to discuss the state of the GOP amidst the turmoil caused by leaked audio of Donald Trump describing how his celebrity status allows him to get away with sexually assaulting women. Per news reports, Ryan is now trying to distance himself from his party's presidential nominee but is still standing by his plan to vote for Trump. According to CNN, Ryan gave his blessing to House Republicans to either ditch Trump or to stay behind the GOP candidate, saying ""you all need to do what's best for you and your district."" It sounds as if Ryan has essentially given up hope that Republicans can defeat Hillary Clinton and win back the White House. Ryan has expressed general discomfort with Trump throughout the campaign. After Trump went off against an Indiana judge, saying the judge's Mexican heritage made him unfit to oversee a case against Trump University, Ryan called Trump's statement the ""textbook definition of a racist comment."" Yet Trump was Ryan's racist, and the House Speaker campaigned for the GOP nominee. At the Republican National Convention this summer, Ryan said, ""Only with Donald Trump and Mike Pence do we have a chance of a better way."" Even though he disinvited Trump to campaign with him in Wisconsin this weekend, saying he was ""sickened"" by the leaked video, Ryan is still planning to vote for the candidate he says he won't  campaign for or defend.

100484,1006,Here’s why ratings for the “new low in American debates” look to be down 20%,http://hotair.com/archives/2016/10/10/heres-ratings-new-low-american-debates-look-20/,18,"Last night’s debate is being hailed (or trashed) in the media as one of the biggest and most outrageous of such events in modern political history, but a look at the early numbers coming in show that not nearly as many people witnessed it firsthand as we expected. It will still take a while to crunch all the numbers but Reuters is reporting that the total viewership could have dropped by more than 16 million when compared to the September 26th event.

The Hollywood Reporter, CNN and Variety said on Monday that very early overnight ratings from Nielsen showed the TV audience was about 19 percent to 20 percent down from the Sept. 26 debate, which attracted a record 84 million viewers.

Final figures for all network and cable channels that carried the debate will be released by Nielsen later on Monday.
Variety has the specific early figures which will be tightened up by this evening.

In Nielsen’s overnight metered markets, Sunday’s 9-10:40 p.m. ET debate averaged a 37.2 household rating and 53 share. That’s down 19% from the 46.2/63 overnight rating for their first debate. That contest wound up setting a record for presidential debate viewership with 84 million viewers.

Nielsen’s 56 overnight metered markets reach about 70% of TV households in the U.S.
This will lead to a lot of head scratching among the chattering class. As recently as yesterday afternoon the experts were already predicting that this one could shatter all records and possibly produce Super Bowl level numbers. Obviously we didn’t come anywhere near that, but even a 20% drop would still amount to more than 67 million viewers. That’s a lot of people… roughly half the number who are expected to vote in the election. I suppose we shouldn’t complain too much in that regard, and it’s a significant trouncing of the premier of Dancing With the Stars this season which only drew a comparatively paltry 12.2 million viewers. Perhaps there’s hope for society after all.

But why would people who aren’t political junkies be less inclined to check out this critical moment in deciding the next president? I wonder if the media isn’t shooting itself in the foot by assigning such dismal descriptions to the event, along with pretty much everything else to do with Donald Trump. The Hill quickly moved to characterize the debate as, “both nasty and personal, especially in its early stages, potentially turning off more voters from both candidates than it won over for either.”

Over at NBC News, Chuck Todd and his associates described the spectacle as, “a new low in this 2016 presidential campaign.”

As Buzzfeed writes, Trump went “Full Breitbart” last night. And it all produced a new low in this 2016 presidential campaign.

And it sets up a looming disaster for the GOP

Trump going “Full Breitbart” has definitely fired up his base (last night was what Trump operatives Steve Bannon and David Bossie had always dreamed about). And that creates a looming disaster for Republicans who need to win over non-Breitbart voters: How do you distance yourself from Trump — especially after those 2005 lewd comments — but avoid the wrath coming your way from the base?
Here’s something that I don’t think Chuck Todd and the rest of the gang are really grasping… Trump isn’t in this to help the GOP. And in large numbers, prominent figures in the party haven’t seemed particularly interested in helping him. Also, he’s turned out to be the sort of street fighter who isn’t going to play by the rules and will start swinging for the fences (or his opponent’s jaw, figuratively speaking) as soon as he deems it appropriate. But if you choose to characterize that sort of approach as low or nasty or any other combination of adjectives designed to make Trump seem unappealing, might you not be reducing the appeal of the encounter for the prospective audience?

And let’s not kid ourselves here. Those reviews I just linked were already baked into the cake before the event took place. This debate was sold in advance as a Not Safe for Work encounter. CNN ran an article on the morning of the big show asking, Will you let your kids watch the next presidential debate? If that’s the expectation you are building you probably shouldn’t cry into your beer too much if your ratings go down. One might think that parents who have been warned that the show may be too disgusting for their kids might not care to tune in themselves. And what purpose did the warnings serve? As a political analyst you might be put off by Trump calling Clinton “a liar” or saying he’d like to see her locked up, but nobody was dropping F-bombs on the stage. There was no nudity or physical violence.

No, in the end it was a perfectly safe show for all age groups unless you’re a special snowflake at college who must be protected from dissenting opinions. But if the media sold the debate as a show that was going to be a horrible spectacle, let’s not wring our hands over the advertising dollars you may have lost when potential viewers took you at your word."

Instead, she’s seemingly all aboard the Trump-train strategy of burning down the party around them even as she’s telling Chris Matthews that America can’t take the risk of having Democrats packing the Supreme Court. We must defeat Hillary, or else we must also … wreck the Republican Congress? What?

Ben Shapiro can’t believe it:

If Kellyanne Conway has names to name, by all means, do it. Why is she shielding Republicans from charges of sexual harassment or assault? By not naming names, she slanders all Republicans who won’t back her man as sexual criminals. That’s morally disgusting.

And it’s absolutely destructive to both conservatives and the GOP…

Trump’s campaign doesn’t seek victory. It seeks a glorious end, a Wagnerian ring cycle Gotterdammerung. Everyone must go up in flames with Trump – and if they try to escape, he will seize them and drag them into the fire. Trump fans said they wanted everything to burn. Now they’ll get their wish. And they may get a Hillary-dominated White House, Congress, and Supreme Court because of it.
The rumor yesterday, fueled by her unusual silence on Twitter on Friday evening and all day Saturday, was that Conway’s support for Trump was wavering after the tape and that she might finally cut bait. Per NBC:

“We’re watching the end of the Trump campaign,” one Republican state director told NBC News. “There is clearly no control over him inside the operation.”…

A source within the campaign also strongly implied to NBC News that Conway was considering leaving the campaign in the midst of the latest turmoil.

“Kellyanne is a good practicing Catholic,” the source said. “She’s thinking ‘I have kids. Is this what I want?’ She’s never shied away from the role her faith plays in her life.”
If there’s any truth to that, though, Conway’s doing a heck of a good job hiding it. She posted a “unity” photo with Trump yesterday en route to the debate, and she sounds every inch the diehard Trump supporter in the clips below. (Although the “unless” in the second clip is provocative.) There’s also a widely shared assumption that Conway was a key force internally in getting Trump to be a more disciplined candidate in September, a strategy that’s basically out the window now since he underprepared for the first debate and then took Clinton’s bait about Alicia Machado afterward. She could, in other words, conclude that he’s rejected her approach to the race and bow out on those grounds. But she hasn’t. Maybe she’s calculating that quitting the campaign now, even with a disaster looming, will do more damage to her career than staying to the bitter end will. If she quits, she’ll be seen as fickle and disloyal by future candidates who might otherwise want to work with her; if she stays put and goes down with the ship, she’ll bear little blame for it. “No one could have won with a candidate as erratic as Trump,” people will say. If anything, as the lone respected pro in Trump’s inner circle, she’ll be seen in her field as a sympathetic figure who played a terrible hand as best she could. Unless, of course, she really does abet Trump in his burn-it-all-down war on the rest of the party this month, which she seems ready to do here. Very strange. Surely she’s not so invested in Trump’s fading candidacy that she’d side with him over saving the Republican House majority, is she?"
100486,1006,Paul Ryan: Won’t campaign with or defend Trump any longer — but still endorsing him,http://hotair.com/archives/2016/10/10/paul-ryan-wont-campaign-defend-trump-longer-still-endorsing/,18,"Paul Ryan has seen enough of the presidential campaign, and wants to get out. The Speaker of the House told his caucus that he will no longer campaign with Donald Trump nor defend him publicly. Ryan apparently made that decision on Friday in canceling his joint appearance with Trump over the weekend after the release of the “grab her by the p****” video, but made it official today. Ryan also stressed that House members seeking re-election needed to prioritize their own campaigns over that of the Republican presidential nominee:

House Speaker Paul Ryan told fellow Republicans Monday he will no longer defend GOP nominee Donald Trump and will instead use the next 29 days to focus on preserving his party’s hold on Congress. …

In a conference call with members Monday morning, Ryan told members “you all need to do what’s best for you and your district,” according to someone who listened to the meeting.
At the same time, Ryan told his fellow House Republicans that his endorsement of Trump still stands:

Speaker Paul Ryan (R-Wis.) told rank-and-file Republicans he will not rescind his endorsement of Donald Trump for now but that he will not defend the embattled GOP presidential nominee, according to sources on a Monday conference call.
In other words, Ryan has decided to adjust his own priorities. As Speaker, his first priority should be to ensure that the GOP retains control of the lower chamber anyway. As a party leader, he owes some effort to the presidential effort too, but he’s basically saying he’ll do the minimum in continuing his formal endorsement, and that’s it — and letting his troops know that’s an acceptable decision for them too, on a case-by-case basis. Ryan’s looking at the long-term prospects for the GOP in that sense.

However, that has some long-term risks, too. The sudden abandonment of Trump by other party leaders generated a lot of anger, some of which Ryan himself fielded at the Saturday event from which he’d disinvited Trump. It’s a little late in the day for GOP figures to be shocked, shocked to find that Donald Trump is a vulgarian who oozes self-entitlement from every pore. That was his schtick not just for eleven seasons of The Apprentice, but also for the decades that he’s been in the public eye. Howard Stern had a field day with Trump in playing that up — and so did Trump himself, for that matter. Even if Trump himself admitted that his remarks went beyond the pale and had to apologize for them, that’s a matter of degree, not character.

Until now, the message from the GOP has been twofold: He may be a vulgarian but he’s our vulgarian, and The other option is worse. Er … what’s changed? The intellectual basis for Point Two is that we have to control Supreme Court nominations and that Hillary Clinton is too corrupt to hold office. Have those leaders changed their minds on that? If so, then let’s hear the arguments for their new position that the tape negates both of those underpinnings. Absent that, it looks like a panicked run for the exits for Trump’s endorsers.

And that has big implications for the long run. If the party stands behind Trump, at least formally, and he loses, then the lesson will be that Republican primary voters chose very very poorly and didn’t understand what it takes to win a general election. If the party abandons Trump 30 days before the election and he loses — especially if the impact of the tape turns out to be rather small (about which later) — then the narrative becomes “a stab in the back.” It will be difficult to argue for party unity after that, and it may end up destroying what’s left of the GOP’s credibility with its own voters.

It’s a lose-lose scenario either way, but right now, it looks like the GOP is acting in a completely reactionary manner than almost guarantees that they will maximize the damage from this cycle.

Update (AP): Precisely because of what Ed says about the risk of Ryan alienating pro-Trump Republican voters, the internal polling conducted by the GOP over the weekend must have been downright apocalyptic to convince him that cutting Trump loose this way nonetheless remains House Republicans’ best option. And apparently it was:

Many of these same operatives also said [before the debate] they did not think Trump’s horrible, no good past few days had put the GOP’s House majority — a 60-seat edge — in danger. “We aren’t in that zone yet,” said Mike Shields, president of the Congressional Leadership Fund, a super-PAC aligned with Ryan that is spending $20 million to help the GOP keep its House majority.

But a few minutes after midnight, a House leadership aide texted me: “House in play.” I asked if this was based on any actual data. Yes, the aide said, but more will need to come in over the next few days to be certain.
Hillary knows it’s in play too. Until now, she’s made a point of saying that Trump doesn’t represent other Republicans, which is her way of trying to tempt anti-Trump GOPers into supporting her. But now she’s going for the kill: The last NBC/WSJ poll gave Democrats a 48/45 advantage on the congressional generic ballot. Their lead in the new one that dropped this morning is … 49/42. If Trump’s polling doesn’t rebound, Democrats could control all of government next year with nothing stopping Clinton’s agenda except Chuck Schumer’s willingness to protect the Republican minority’s ability to filibuster in the Senate. The party could see a bloodbath from both sides in November in which Trumpers stay home out of disgust for Ryan et al. abandoning Trump while swing voters, disgusted by Trump, turn against the GOP anyway."
100487,1007,Glenn Beck: If Not Voting For Trump Means Hillary Wins So Be It “At Least It Is A Moral Ethical Choice”,http://www.youngcons.com/glenn-beck-if-not-voting-for-trump-means-hillary-wins-so-be-it-at-least-it-is-a-moral-ethical-choice/,18,"Glenn Beck posted something on Facebook this past Saturday that’s getting a lot of attention.

Everyone knows that he’s no fan of Donald Trump.

Some of his arguments make perfect sense.  Some don’t.

But his post on Saturday definitely made him sound like someone who is ready to support Hillary or at least justify her winning the race.  The difference between actually voting for her and actively encouraging millions of people not to try and stop her is microscopic.

From Breitbart:

The Blaze founder Glenn Beck took to his Facebook page last Saturday to urge his followers to abandon support of Republican nominee Donald Trump, declaring that if such an action results in the election of Hillary Clinton, “so be it” because “[a]t least it is a moral, ethical choice.”


“If the consequence of standing against Trump and for principles is indeed the election of Hillary Clinton, so be it. At least it is a moral, ethical choice,” Beck wrote.

Here is the Facebook post.  Read it for yourself. I’m not one of those guys who hates Glenn Beck and he really knows his stuff when it comes to history.  He seems like a good guy who only wants what is best for the country.  I’ve got his books and listen to his show so by no means am I a “Beck hater”.

But how condescending does this sound? This translates, at least to me, that not voting for Trump is the moral thing to do.

So many people have tried to make this similar argument that somehow morality says Hillary is the answer or that Trump isn’t.   We hear this all the time that “true Christians” can’t support Trump or that morality says that you can’t vote for Trump.

When in reality, it says the exact opposite.

Morality would not let you vote for someone who violated the public’s trust and earned millions from being a public servant thanks to an insanely diabolical pay for play operation disguised as a foundation. Then she lied to our face about it for a year.

Morality wouldn’t let you vote for someone who lied under oath during her Benghazi testimony.  It wouldn’t let you vote for someone who intimidated alleged victims of sexual assault.  It wouldn’t let you vote for someone who ignored hundreds of requests for more security at Benghazi and failed to send help for 13 hours resulting in the loss of four American lives.  It also wouldn’t let you vote for someone who supported an organization like Planned Parenthood that commits barbaric and immoral acts on a daily basis.  That’s just the tip of the iceberg.

Morality would also at least suggest that it isn’t “moral” to sit back and not try to stop someone who did that. Even if it made you uncomfortable on some issues.  Morality is not only nuanced but it is different for a lot of people.  Voters prioritize different issues.

So to sit back and pretend that Trump making rude comments about women somehow excludes any moral person from voting for him just doesn’t hold any water.  Beck didn’t say that word for word of course but the obvious implication is that not voting for either is the moral thing to do.  I would argue that stopping the kind of immorality we see from Hillary on a weekly basis, or at least trying, is the right thing to do.

And yes, it’s a bummer, but by not supporting one of the two candidates you are very much supporting whoever wins. Maybe not in Southern California where I am but certainly in a place like Pennsylvania or Florida.

That’s how our system works.

You can bet that a lot of conservatives won’t be happy with Glenn.  He knows that. So I respect him for coming out and just saying what he feels regardless but I’m pretty tired of the implication that a vote for Trump is a vote against morality or a vote against the Church or something like that.  How is that different than Hillary’s comment about Trump supporters being deplorable?

At the very least, let’s knock it off with criticizing the moral compass of fellow conservatives.

You ever notice how the left doesn’t do stuff like that?  That’s why they win elections.  Wouldn’t that be nice for once?

That’s my take. What’s yours?

At the conclusion of the second presidential debate, the network held a focus group to determine who won, Donald Trump or Hillary Clinton.

Right at the beginning of this clip, you can hear a CNN “reporter” or “journalist” actually coaching the undecided voters about what they should be saying about Hillary.

She wanted the group to, get this, support grandma.

Yes, journalism is dead.

No, CNN has never been “down the middle” compared to Fox News and MSNBC. From Federalist Papers:

During one moment, Hillary Clinton said “America is already great, but we are great because we are good.” It’s a complete throw-away line – something any politician might utter because they simply have nothing better to say.

So when the camera turned to the room of “undecided voters,” the mic captured the CNN moderator whispering an “appropriate” answer to the audience before they ask the question. One woman in particular looked at the moderator and nodded approvingly. She got it. She knew what to say. Shame, shame.

Many physicians believes she may also suffer from Parkinson’s disease.

Her medical condition alone makes her unfit to hold the office of the president, never mind her malfeasance.

Problem is, we don’t know exactly what she suffers from – and we may never know. We do know about the brain blood clots and the concussions, but that’s about it.

Here’s some information that is highly relevant.

A reporter admitted live on air that the Secret Service banned cameras from the second presidential debate due to Hillary’s seizure disorder. From Gateway Pundit:

REPORTER: “This is why it was banned apparently because the Secret Service did not trust people to disable the flashes on their cameras and they were afraid it would inspire Hillary’s seizure disorder.” Quite telling, no?

How come the major networks aren’t reporting this?

100490,1008,Trump's Taxes Aren't the Problem,http://www.americanthinker.com/articles/2016/10/trumps_taxes_arent_the_problem.html,18,"Why, exactly, are Donald Trump's federal income tax returns important to anyone beyond the fact that he has broken no laws?

It's unlikely we'll ever find that Donald Trump has done something illegal with his taxes.  Hillary knows that.  What is being suggested is that he has done something not legally wrong, but morally wrong by exploiting ""loopholes"" in order to pay less to the government than he could have, or than he supposedly should have.  The revelation has been that he has paid high-priced CPAs and attorneys, who helped him reduce his taxable liability to the very least he is legally required to pay.

If you happen to find such a thing offensive, please review your own tax returns.  Do you write anything off when you file your taxes each year?  The interest on your home?  The cost of childcare?  Home office expenses?  Mileage on your vehicle?  All of those things?  Even more to the quick, do you arrange your tax return in such a way that your tax liability is even the slightest bit reduced for any reason whatsoever?  Could you have paid more to the government than you were legally required to pay, and if so, are you to be criticized for not having done so?

Of course you could have paid more than you did.  And of course you've nothing wrong by not doing so.  Only in the unique ideological prism of the leftist political elite and the envious grumblers they carry in tow could it be assumed that you have done something wrong.  What you've done is legal and, dare I say, smart.

Trump's taxes aren't the problem, and neither are yours.  The real problem is the misguided, bloated, and incompetent government that collects them.

You see, this whole issue boils down to a fundamental difference in how progressives and conservatives see the world and, more peculiarly, the purpose of federal taxation.

If you are a progressive, you largely view the government as a charity with boundless charge, and you see taxation as the ever more necessary coerced ""contributions"" to that charity. 

If you are a conservative, you likely see taxation as an unfortunate necessity for the functioning of government.  And you likely see the federal government, in particular, as having very few distinct (yet important) responsibilities, each of which is clearly delineated by that document called the United States Constitution. 

And as a conservative, you likely see the scope of taxation through a lens of proportion.  Dr. Ben Carson spoke of the fairness of the conservative viewpoint at the National Prayer Breakfast in 2013, as Barack Obama (who thoroughly disagrees with this concept of fairness) squirmed in his seat.

""God has given us a system,"" Dr. Carson declared, speaking of tithing.  He continued:

There must be something inherently fair in proportionality.  If you make ten billion dollars, you put in one billion.  If you make ten dollars, you put in one. Of course, you gotta get rid of the loopholes. [Laughter] But, now, some people say, ""Well, that's not fair, because it doesn't hurt the guy who made ten million dollars as much as the guy who made ten.""  Where does it say you have to hurt the guy?  He just put a billion dollars in the pot!

If you are progressive, that likely doesn't make sense to you, and that is because progressivism is a faith that supplants religious faith and even clouds the simple secular logic that supports Dr. Carson's statement.  After all, Trump would have paid a lot of taxes in such a system as Carson describes.  But what would be the point of a system of taxation that doesn't hurt the guy who makes more and benefit the guy who makes less, thereby striving toward some mystical balance of fortunes for all people, everywhere?

In case you haven't noticed, the left makes a serious issue of the ""fair share"" that high income earners owe the government but fail to pay (despite financing the greatest part of the government's endeavors).  Hillary mentioned this several times in the debate with Donald Trump, prefacing her later attack on him with the suggestion that he hasn't released his tax returns and that this fact alone should be clear evidence that he, being the rich guy he is, doesn't pay his ""fair share.""

The conservative argument is, again, rooted in true ""fairness"" – that everyone should pay an equal percentage of his income to the coffers.  The progressive argument, by contrast, is predicated upon the notion that the reality that regulates economic activity is so fundamentally unfair that rich elitists in Washington must disproportionately seize more wealth from those with higher incomes and subsequently provide that seized wealth to those who earn less, thereby making the disproportionate seizure of wealth somehow ""fair.""

It's not a new notion by any stretch of the imagination.  A ""progressive, graduated income tax"" is one of the Ten Planks of Communism, as described by Karl Marx in his Communist Manifesto.  The left repackages this concept each election cycle, each time presenting it as if it's some new idea to save the world, rather than an idea which has led to over 100 million deaths at the hands of socialist tyrants in our immediate 20th-century rearview.

It is with such twisted ideological standards as ballast that Clinton is now pitching government as a charity for the lesser among us and taxation of the rich as the path to redistributionist Nirvana.

This is not the purpose of our government at all, and it never has been.  But what's most bothersome about all of it is not that Hillary and her ilk believe that their role in governance is charity.  What's most bothersome is that they actually believe that government is, or even could be, good at it.

Government is wasteful.  If it were measured as a charity, a business, or any other institution, it would undeniably be deemed an inefficient mess. 

The government's balance sheet is wildly out of whack, with nearly $20 trillion in debt, with almost half of that accrued in Obama's tenure alone.  Social Security is in peril, and Medicare is in even worse shape, and (surprise, surprise!) the only suggestions to make them more viable involve demanding that rich people pay more to the government to keep these Titanics afloat amid the demographic icebergs of reality.  Obamacare has proven to be an absolute disaster; not only didn't it allow Americans to keep their doctor, but prices and health care premiums are rising at unprecedented levels.  People, and particularly people in poverty, whom this redistributionist government is meant to serve, are more unhappy, anxious, and angry than ever. 

There is nothing good that can come of us giving more money to the Wizards of D.C., allowing them to take more of our money behind the curtain and funnel it through distribution channels to special interests in the guise of the ""greater good"" of public redistribution.  This practice has been tried and has proven to be ineffective, expensive, and not least of all, an anathema to the very concept of liberty.

Don't believe me?  Barack Obama has, for the last few years, taken in more revenue in tax receipts than at any time in American history that came before.  Why, if lack of ample taxation and government revenue is the problem, has government debt continued to climb these past years?  Why is the debt needle not moving the other direction?  Why is Hillary Clinton back at the pulpit telling the country that we need more revenue from rich people, who need to pay their ""fair share,"" and that, somehow, more tax revenue is the answer to all our problems?

Donald Trump said in the debate that he is proposing ""the biggest tax cut since Ronald Reagan.""  The beauty of Reagan's tax cuts, and the prosperity they fostered, is that they put wealth, and the decisions of what to do with it, in the hands of people who have a vested interest in being wise and efficient with their money – namely, businesses and individuals. 

Business and individuals just like you. 

Is your money not better serving your families and communities in your hands, rather than the government's?  If it is not, why do you write off you mortgage interest every year rather than sending it to the federal coffers?

Trump did likewise, and he has kept more money in his own hands.  He explained why he did it over a year ago.  ""I fight like hell to pay as little as possible for two reasons,"" he said:

Number one, I'm a businessman.  And that's the way you're supposed to do it, and you put the money back into your company and your employees, and all of that.  But the other reason is I hate the way the government spends our taxes.  I hate the way they waste our money.  Trillions and trillions of dollars of waste, and I hate it.

That's the message.  It is better that money be in our hands than the government's, plain and simple.  And Trump shouldn't stray from it when it comes to his taxes.

100491,1008,"Unworthiness, Shame, and Fear: BLM and the Slavery Comparison",http://www.americanthinker.com/articles/2016/10/unworthiness_shame_and_fear_blm_and_the_slavery_comparison.html,18,"The release of Birth of a Nation, a new film about the Nat Turner slave rebellion, has spurred more than a few references to the Black Lives Matter (BLM) movement in the liberal press.  Though the movie is obviously being marketed with modern controversies in mind, the comparisons are spurious, as the BLM movement, based as it is on a contrived and false narrative, bears little or no relation to the Turner uprising.  What the left-leaning mainstream media will not acknowledge is that the movement that reflects the spirit if not the exact dynamics of a slave uprising is the one pushing Donald Trump's election.  And that is also why the media and Washington elites are so desperate to kill Trump's bid.

Reviewers less than blown away by the film, like at the Washington Post (2_ stars), still feel compelled to mention BLM.  The New Yorker, in an even less enthused review, nonetheless notes the ""stubborn recurrence of killings of black men at the hands of police,"" though not explicitly mentioning BLM.  Others certainly do, and the BLM movement itself has tried to tie itself to the themes of the movie.   

Turner's uprising was a terrible moment in American history for multiple reasons, from the brutal and oppressive system of  slavery that provoked it to the merciless and bloody revolt itself to the equally ruthless and violent retribution visited on slaves afterward, whether involved in the revolt or not. 

Unlike Turner's revolt against real oppression, the BLM movement protests the predictable and indeed inevitable consequences of law enforcement in a country of with a population of over 320 million, approximately 40 million of whom are non-Hispanic black people, half of whom are male (about 15.5 million adults).  This population is unfortunately disproportionately involved in criminal activity, at a rate roughly three times what it should be based on demographics.  Out of this rather large population of men, a statistically excessive minority of whom are involved in criminal activity, a very small number are occasionally shot by police in violent encounters.

The BLM movement is a ready-made liberal faux cause precisely because it predicates itself on inevitable social and demographic facts (that among a large population in a very big country, some will inevitably be killed by police).  It attaches to that a provocative and false cause, endemic white racism, even when the most clearly objective of facts demonstrate otherwise, as when black men are killed by black police officers.  In this the BLM movement is not at all different from such other liberal ""causes"" as climate change, poverty, and sex.  What they all share is naturally occurring physical and/or social phenomena to which the left attaches nefarious causes, and proposes disruptive and/or oppressive solutions that benefit liberal elites.

Slavery, the peculiar institution that Turner revolted against, was neither a naturally occurring phenomenon nor a matter of social inevitability or necessity.  To be sure, slavery had long been a part of the human condition, but never necessarily so, and by the 19th century, most Western nations had cast it aside.  Likewise, other slave revolts through history could hardly be gainsaid or morally condemned simply because slavery had long been accepted in many human societies.  To compare the condition of enslaved blacks with modern American blacks is absurd and bizarre.

On the other hand, the revolt against elites represented by Trump's candidacy bears a much closer relationship to Turner's uprising or other historical revolts against real oppression.  The proof is in the reaction of elites to the two movements.

By their very nature, slave revolts incite the most profound reactions among elites in the societies against which they are waged.  The historian Plutarch wrote of the ""unworthiness and shame"" plus ""fear"" that the Spartacus rebellion provoked in the Roman Senate.  The Haitian slave revolt that predated Turner's by only a few years elicited similar responses among its French victims (and Europeans in general), from written accounts to horrific propagandistic prints.  Turner's uprising prompted similar reactions.

By contrast, the BLM movement has been positively adopted by the Democratic Party, its chief candidate for president, and by most of the elite mainstream press in this country.  Its leaders are not derided, but feted.  Hillary Clinton's increasingly likely election will cement the BLM movement as a permanent tool of Democrat politics and social manipulation, something that probably would have horrified Nat Turner.

Now consider how Trump and his followers are described by American elites, particularly but not exclusively on the Democrat side.  Unworthiness, shame, and fear accurately encapsulate the view of elites in politics and the press toward Trump and his followers.  Hillary Clinton's description of Trump's followers as ""deplorables"" mirrors almost exactly that of slaveholding elites toward the rebellion of their human chattel.  Take just this piece from the Huffington Post in which Trump is described as a ""serial liar, racist, narcissist, buffoon, "" inducing in normal people ""vomiting,"" and likening him and his ""blind"" followers to a rolling ""dirty snowball"" and a ""fungus[.]""  Just the kind of invective embodying unworthiness, shame, and fear that has always marked the palpable dread among elites to the revolt of their unwashed inferiors. 

And while Trump's followers are hardly slaves, they do legitimately see themselves as oppressed, with no less than Hillary's husband recently confirming the same, in describing the imposition of Obamacare on the ordinary working population.  It is an economic and not merely metaphorical yoke upon their own health and livelihoods, along with myriad other artifacts of progressivism. 

Trump's latest troubles, which may cost him the presidency, are partly a consequence of his own oafish personality, but also the double standards attached by the media and elites to the escapades of the would-be leader the revolt that they so fear.  Isn't uneasiness over the wolfishness of men like Trump and Bill Clinton a matter of unsophisticated middle-class moralism, according to Democrats?  Another Roman historian, Tacitus, described the barbaric morality of the Germans, who actually honored their wives and marriages, something sophisticated Romans sneered at.  Of course, the answer for the sophisticated liberal elite is that a wolfish Bill Clinton is charming, while Trump is a misogynist scumbag – like his supporters. 

Slave revolts throughout history were relatively rare, successful ones extremely so.  Overcoming the power and disdain of elites, particularly once fully motivated by their shame and fear, is no easy thing.  It won't be this time, either, and it just got harder.

100492,1008,Only One Way for the FBI to Regain Its Lost Reputation,http://www.americanthinker.com/articles/2016/10/only_one_way_for_the_fbi_to_regain_its_lost_reputation.html,18,"James Comey, the crooked political operative running the FBI for the left, has clearly lied to Congress, lied to the American people, and fixed the criminal investigative process to protect Hillary Clinton and her creepy aides from justice.  Conservatives have gotten used to the Department of Justice under Obama as simply another organ of leftist activism.  Eric Holder and Loretta Lynch have both been abominable heads of the Department of Justice, and several federal judges have indicated as much.

Using federal agencies as tools of political oppression or leftist activism is the best case yet simply abolishing the Department of Justice completely and devolving the enforcement of all federal laws to the fifty state attorney general offices. 

In the same vein, one might think we should leave the FBI only for the purpose of supporting state law enforcement efforts with technical support, but that was before the incredible stream of new revelations, never volunteered by Comey and discovered only by insistent probing, that show intimate collusion between the Clinton campaign and the FBI, with sleazy actions so blatantly bad that no serious person can doubt the wrongness of it all.

Physical evidence is destroyed before anyone can see it, though subpoenaed by Congress and possibly containing classified information.  Computer systems with classified documents scrubbed clean by private vendors before federal officers know what has been scrubbed.  Suspects sit in on the questioning of other suspects, and suspects are given immunity, it appears, for no good reasons at all.

If this presidential election is fixed by an utterly politicized FBI, then the reputation of that agency will never recover.  No serious American, in that case, should ever believe anything the FBI tells us about anything at all.  If we cannot trust the FBI when powerful politicians are being investigated, then when can we trust it?  If the FBI can be influenced by politicians, then it can be influenced by drug lords or crime bosses or crooked billionaires.  

There is only one thing, at this point, that can rehabilitate the reputation of a once honorable organization now up to its neck in the muck of influenced investigations and tampered justice.  A number of current FBI agents must publicly condemn Director Comey and deplore the deeply disturbing, very unusual actions taken by the FBI in these investigations.  This may cost the agents involved their careers, but agents who care about the agency more than their careers will take that risk.  These agents ought to explain exactly how this investigation was utterly wrong and how it deviated from normal practices. 

Director Comey compelled twenty-five agents to sign nondisclosure agreements, but these agreements cannot prevent these agents from publicly criticizing how politicized the investigation appeared to them.  In fact, this might even be more telling: ""We have been ordered by Director Comey to sign nondisclosure agreements, so until he releases us from those agreements, we cannot provide details, but we can say this:  the whole thing stinks from top to bottom.  Everything about this investigation fails the smell test.  If Director Comey will release us from the nondisclosure agreements, we will be happy to say more."" 

If FBI agents need a model, they might look to the National Border Control Council, which, frustrated by politically correct border enforcement, took the Obama administration to task.  These border control agents cared more about America than their careers and used their private association as a vehicle.

There is an FBI Agents Association that represents 12,000 current and retired agents and advocates criminal justice issues to Congress.  Members of this private association have 55 different field office representatives in as many cities of the nation.  Nothing prevents these field office representatives from signing a letter on behalf of the members in their region condemning the whole structure of this putrid conspiracy against honorable and serious investigation.

Indeed, if this association ever expects Congress or the American people to listen to it, then it is vitally important that it act before the election.  The FBI Agents Association, of course, should not endorse any candidate or party, but if it urges funding increases to Congress or changes in criminal laws, it must have credibility.  And if it ignores the swollen carbuncle of this scandal within the agency, no one ought to listen to it anymore.

There is this one chance for the FBI to redeem the damage done by Comey.  There will be no second chance if Hillary wins because of the cowardice of the Bureau's agents.

100493,1009,OBAMA VOTER FRAUD IN COLORADO,http://www.powerlineblog.com/archives/2016/10/obama-voter-fraud-in-colorado.php,18,"I have been working my way through the John Podesta emails that were released by Wikileaks. They provide an interesting look behind the scenes of the Hillary Clinton campaign, but generally don’t seem to contain a lot of blockbusters. This one was spotted by Breitbart. Podesta reports on a meeting with two friends of the Clintons from Colorado, at least one of whom is a lawyer.

In his email, Podesta recounts what these two Coloradans told him about their experience with the Colorado caucuses in 2008: “They are reliving the 08 caucuses where they believe the Obama forces flooded the caucuses with ineligible voters.”

Voter fraud: when Republicans complain about it, the Democrats’ party line is that it practically never happens. But when they are talking among themselves, they acknowledge that the Obama campaign “flooded the caucuses with ineligible voters.”

Voter fraud has been, and continues to be, a major problem."
100494,1009,DOES THIS ELECTION PRESENT A BINARY CHOICE?,http://www.powerlineblog.com/archives/2016/10/is-this-election-a-binary-choice.php,18,"On Friday, Ammo Girl (hereinafter Susan) wrote a characteristically excellent post arguing that conservatives, and in particular elite pundits, should rally behind Donald Trump. Basically, she argued (1) that Trump is clearly preferable to Hillary Clinton and (2) that the election presents us with a “binary choice” between the two major candidates.

Susan wrote her article before the Access Hollywood video was made public. But for me, this development does not detract from her argument. The video revealed nothing about Trump that I didn’t already believe.

As for Susan’s argument, I agree with her first point. Trump is clearly preferable to Clinton, in my view. I won’t make that case here except to say that I prefer a terrible person who will deliver a partly liberal and partly conservative administration to a terrible person who will deliver a mostly left-liberal one.

I question Susan’s second point, though. She is right, of course, to say that at times we must choose between two, and only two, unattractive options. In the example she cites, she and her siblings must decide whether their elderly father will stay in Minnesota, where he is lonely, or move to Arizona, where he will be in unfamiliar surroundings. These apparently are the only real options and the family must pick one.

A presidential election is different. An individual voter doesn’t pick the president. One of the two candidates will become president whether I vote for Trump, vote for Clinton, or vote for neither.

Individual voters don’t have the power over the presidential decision that Susan has over the decision about where her father shall live. In reality, the individual has no effective power to pick the president.

All the individual voter really has the power to do is make a statement. For someone who sees the election as I do, that statement can be “Trump would make a better president than Clinton.” But it can also be “neither candidate is remotely fit to be president.” Both statements are true, in my opinion. If I face a “binary decision,” it is to select which of these two statements to make.

The presumption is in favor of making the first statement. If citizens routinely cited the futility of their individual vote as a reason for not voting, the system wouldn’t work. Democracy in a mass society depends on citizens pretending that their vote is influential.

Nonetheless, our democracy also permits citizens not to participate in selecting the president. Thus, the choice in this presidential election, as in all others, is not binary. It includes the option of voting for neither candidate — an option that shirks no obligation and will not cause the greater of two evils to prevail.

My inclination is to vote for Trump as long as the race is competitive. However, if by Election Day he’s toast, my inclination will be to vote for neither candidate.

In a scenario where Trump’s prospects are only marginally better than, say, Gary Johnson’s, it won’t make much sense to behave as if the choice this election presents is “binary.” And the statement I will want to make with my vote in this scenario is one of disgust with Trump and protest against the Republican Party."
100495,1009,SUCKING THE LIFE OUT OF CHILDHOOD,http://www.powerlineblog.com/archives/2016/10/sucking-the-life-out-of-childhood.php,18,"When I was a kid, I spent my summers swimming in a lake, building rafts, manning a rowboat and zipping around in a speed boat, blowing stuff up with Zebras and cherry bombs, playing with animals of various sorts, and engaging (with zero skill) in sports and games, unsupervised by adults.

Youngsters nowadays are not so fortunate. Most of them are subjected to the soul-crushing conformity of nanny-state political correctness. How bad has it gotten? My wife was shopping in our neighborhood grocery store today, and noticed a display of games. Or, more specifically, flash cards. Click to enlarge pretty massively: What we have here are “Good Citizenship” and “Respect the Earth” flash cards. They are meant to teach moral lessons, like Pilgrim’s Progress or the 19th Century McGuffey’s Readers. Only, if you actually look at the McGuffey’s, the children in them lived lives of rather wild adventure, by today’s standards. Whereas the lessons on offer here are the thinnest possible gruel.

This is what constitutes good citizenship: “Give a thirsty dog some water.” “NEVER call someone names or use disrespectful language.” “Know the rules and follow them!” (It sounds better in the original German.) “Recycle!” and “Help by setting the table.” And the subtitle: “With every opportunity, be part of your community!”

Then we have the “Respect the Earth” flash cards. (“Don’t take your planet for granted!”) These include “Unplug chargers when not charging!” “Turn off the lights.” “Shop at farmer’s markets.” “Set the computer to power-saver mode.” “Don’t leave plastic on the beach!” and “Recycle bottles and paper.” So recycling is a twofer.

It is not clear that these are actually flash cards, in the traditional sense, or how one would play with them. But that is a moot point, since even the most craven six-year-old would turn up his nose at such boring stuff. At best, he would dump out the box and look for the choking hazard. Even the “eco-finger paint” or the “eco-crayons,” also visible in the photo, would offer more entertainment.

If there is a silver lining to this suppression of normal childhood, it is that the nanny-staters must be raising a generation of rebels. Any self-respecting kid would react vigorously, in the opposite direction, to such inept efforts at indoctrination. So maybe America is filling up with budding, six-year-old conservatives. I certainly hope so."
100496,1010,U.S. senator doesn’t know what sexual assault is,https://thinkprogress.org/trump-surrogates-sexual-assault-rape-culture-658254e30904#.6x5yc72yk,18,"Sen. Jeff Sessions (R-AL) does not think the nonconsensual groping and fondling that Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump bragged about on a newly-released tape from 2005 constitutes sexual assault_—_a claim that runs contrary to the Department of Justice’s definition of sexual assault.
In a video published by the Washington Post on Friday, Trump bragged about how he would use his status as a celebrity to try to grope and kiss women, telling NBC’s Billy Bush that he would “just start kissing them.”
“I don’t even wait,” Trump added. “And when you’re a star, they let you do it,” Trump says. “You can do anything.”
The U.S. Department of Justice defines sexual assault as “any type of sexual contact or behavior that occurs without the explicit consent of the recipient,” including actions like fondling. Clearly, grabbing a woman by the genitals without her explicit consent fits this definition.
But Trump’s surrogates have been quick to deny that.
“I don’t characterize that as sexual assault. I think that’s a stretch. I don’t know what he meant,” Sessions told the Weekly Standard in an interview Sunday night. The interviewer followed up by asking Sessions to clarify whether he thought grabbing a woman by the genitals_—_something Trump also described doing in the video_—_was sexual assault.
“I don’t know. It’s not clear that he_—_how that would occur,” Sessions said.
Sessions is far from the only Trump surrogate to attempt to downplay the harm caused by Trump’s comments. In a video recorded by journalist Christa Dubill, a survivor of sexual abuse is shown in tears after having her concerns about Trump’s comments dismissed by Trump surrogate Omarosa. Since the tape surfaced Friday, the Trump campaign has attempted to pivot away from the comments, calling them “locker room banter” and telling voters to focus on Trump’s actions, not his words. But Trump’s actions also reveal a history of abuse towards women. Earlier this year, a Miss USA contestant in 1997 told the New York Times that Trump had once kissed her without her consent. And that’s far from the only complaint women have levied against Trump_—_in 1997, Jill Harth filed a complaint against Trump in for repeatedly trying to touch her genitals without her consent, and once trying to rape her at his Florida estate in Mar-a-Lago.
Trump himself has denied that the actions described on the tape constitute sexual assault, telling Anderson Cooper during the second presidential debate that “this was locker room talk.”
“We need to get on to much more important and bigger things,” he said. “Nobody has more respect for women than I do.”
Survivors of sexual assault would likely take issue with Trump’s dismissal of sexual assault as an unimportant and small issue, however. After the video of Trump’s comments was released Friday night, thousands shared their stories of sexual assault on Twitter using the hashtag #NotOkay. Sexual assault is extremely pervasive in the United States_—_according to a 2011 government survey, nearly one in five women reported being sexually assaulted. According to statistics from the Rape Abuse Incest National Network, an American is sexually assaulted every two minutes.
Yet only an estimated 16 to 35 percent of sexual assaulted are reported to law enforcement. According to Department of Justice statistics, 13 percent of sexual assault survivors did not report their assault because they believed the police would not do anything to help, and 8 percent believed it was not important enough to report.
The words of Trump surrogates like Sessions and Omarosa only serve to perpetuate the feeling of helplessness that survivors often feel when trying speak about, let alone report to authorities, their sexual assault. To call fondling and groping without consent “a stretch” for constituting sexual assault plays into the fear that survivors of sexual assault will not be believed even if they speak up about their experience. And for a United States senator to not know whether grabbing a woman’s genitals without her consent is sexual assault reinforces the idea that sexual assault is a minor issue that can be glossed over. For the 284,000 Americans that are sexually assaulted each year, it is anything but. "
100497,1010,Trump campaign claims they don’t want to ‘dredge up’ Bill Clinton’s past,https://thinkprogress.org/trump-campaign-dredge-up-clinton-past-e9c121780cf6#.qdeq3y9sm,18,"On CNN Monday morning, GOP vice presidential nominee Mike Pence said he and Donald Trump have no interest in ‘dredging up’ Bill Clinton’s former infidelities after he was asked about audio released on Friday that captured Trump bragging about sexually assaulting women.
So then, naturally, he dredged it up.
“I think the contrast between [Trump’s comments] and what the Clinton’s were involved in 20 years ago, the four women that were present last night was pretty dramatic for most Americans,” Pence told host Alisyn Camerota. “I remember those days. I remember the extraordinary avalanche of scandals that came out of president Bill Clinton’s despicable behavior.” “The American people need to know the deeds of not only president Clinton but the efforts by Hillary Clinton to destroy the reputations of women who made accusations against her husband,” he added. Pence’s comments_—_which come at a crucial time for the GOP presidential candidate’s already shaky relationship with female voters_—_indicate that the vice presidential nominee is in line with the Trump campaign’s efforts to aggressively double-down on Bill Clinton’s past, despite claims to the contrary.
On Friday, the Washington Post released a bombshell video that caught the Republican nominee bragging about sexually assaulting women, leading an unprecedented number of prominent GOP leaders to withdraw their support for the candidate.
In response, the Trump campaign is stirring up controversy over Bill Clinton’s sex scandals, even though Clinton is not running for president himself.
An hour before last night’s debate, Trump held a Facebook live event_—_which he called his “debate preparations”_—_with four women who have accused Clinton of sexual abuse: Juanita Broaddrick, Kathy Shelton, Paula Jones, and Kathleen Willey.
The campaign then attempted to seat the four women in the Trump family’s box at the presidential debate, reportedly hoping they would have a televised confrontation with Bill Clinton. Debate officials intervened and the women ending up sitting with the rest of the audience. Moreover, the presidential hopeful is encouraging his surrogates to change the subject away from his own behavior toward women to harp on Bill Clinton’s marital scandals, according to campaign talking points obtained by CNN. “Hillary Clinton bullied and smeared women like Paula Jones, Gennifer Flowers and Monica Lewinsky,” one reads. “Mr. Trump has never treated women the way Hillary Clinton and her husband did when they actively worked to destroy Bill Clinton’s accusers,” another states.
Pence_—_who is brushing aside rumors that he considered dropping off the presidential ticket as Trump’s campaign became mired in controversy this weekend_—_was less definitive about the allegations on his side of the aisle, however.
“If there was evidence this was more than just locker room talk, then would you drop off the ticket?” Camerota asked.
“Alisyn, he said very clearly last night that was just talk and no action,” Pence replied. "
100498,1010,"Did Trump win this debate? Yes, if you ignore everything he said",https://thinkprogress.org/did-trump-win-this-debate-yes-if-you-ignore-everything-he-said-4be5c2a664d3#.mvpndzgv5,18,"As soon as the presidential debate ended everyone wanted to know: Who won?
For some the answer was, clearly: Donald Trump. A panel on CNN, immediately after the debate, declared the debate a “draw.” Others, including Chris Cillizza at the Washington Post, declared Hillary Clinton the winner.
But at the very least, there was a heated debate about the outcome.
The debate about the debate belies what took place over 90 minutes. Donald Trump’s performance was far outside the norms of American politics. The fact that people are even talking about whether he won shows how severely Trump has distorted American political discourse.
There were at least three moments during the debate that would be virtually unthinkable in any other year.
Trump threatened to jail Hillary Clinton if he wins.
In democracies, political opponents compete for votes until election day. Once a winner is declared, the losers concede, and the campaign is over.
In dictatorships, however, things can work differently. Political opponents are routinely jailed as the winner seeks to consolidate power.
Tonight, in front of tens of millions of people, Donald Trump pledged to jail Hillary Clinton if he becomes president. It was a stunning moment that effectively rejects hundreds years of American democratic tradition.
Trump admitted he has paid no federal income taxes
Earlier this month, the New York Times reported that Trump’s 1995 tax return revealed he filed nearly a $1 billion loss in a single year. The New York Times noted that Trump could have avoided taxes for nearly two decades using this loss.
Tonight, Trump admitted that he did, in fact, use that loss to avoid paying taxes.
COOPER: You claimed a $916 million loss which means you could have avoided paying personal income taxes for years.
You said you pay property taxes, real estate taxes. You have not answered a simple question. Did you use the loss to avoid paying personal federal income taxes?
TRUMP: Of course I do.
He also talked about how he accumulated such a huge loss. One possibility was that Trump suffered an actual $1 billion loss. The other possibility is that Trump created a “paper loss” just to avoid paying taxes. Trump said it was the latter.
COOPER: Have you paid personal federal tax?
TRUMP: A lot of my write-off was depreciation and that Hillary as a senator allowed. The people that give her all this money want it. I understand it the tax code better than anybody that’s run for president.
Counting “depreciation” as a loss is a loophole that real estate investors can use to avoid paying taxes even though these losses may be invented. As ThinkProgress’ Bryce Covert has previously explained:
Developers are allowed to assume that the buildings they own lose value over time, or depreciate, and deduct that potential reduction against their income, no matter whether their buildings may be rising in value or not. They can also borrow money to buy more real estate properties and then deduct the interest they have to pay on that debt.
These tactics are not available to ordinary homeowners.
Confronted with a video of him bragging about sexual assault, Trump told a blatant lie.
The major controversy entering the debate was a video of Trump from 2005 bragging about sexual assault.
Anderson Cooper was very direct in his description of the video: “ You called what you said locker room banter_—_kissing women without consent, grabbing their genitals. That is sexual assault. You bragged that you have sexually assaulted women.”
“Do you understand that?” Anderson asked Trump.
“No, I didn’t say that at all,” Trump replied. But that’s exactly what he said.
Many Republicans have withdrawn their support for Trump over the video. Others who haven’t yet done so nevertheless called on him to apologize and show contrition.
Trump did the opposite. He refused to even acknowledge what he said or why people are upset. "
100499,1001,Marco Rubio is sticking with Trump despite 'impossible to justify' sexual assault comments,http://www.dailykos.com/stories/2016/10/11/1580984/-Marco-Rubio-is-sticking-with-Trump-despite-impossible-to-justify-sexual-assault-comments,19,"Marco Rubio is fast making a name for himself as one of the most craven Republicans running for re-election in 2016. After campaigning hard against Donald Trump in the presidential primary, then putting on his earnest face and looking to get credit for a principled stand against Trump, Rubio became a confirmed Trump voter. And he’s stayed a confirmed Trump voter—even after hearing tape of Trump bragging about sexually assaulting women.

Rubio released a statement Tuesday saying:

I ran against Donald Trump. And while I respect that voters chose him as the GOP nominee, I have never hesitated to oppose his policies I disagree with. And I have consistently rejected his offensive rhetoric and behavior. I disagree with him on many things, but I disagree with his opponent on virtually everything. I wish we had better choices for President. But I do not want Hillary Clinton to be our next President. And therefore my position has not changed.
Rubio previously called Trump’s “grab them by the pussy” remarks “impossible to justify.” During the primaries, he sharply criticized Trump for “refus[ing] to condemn white supremacists and the Ku Klux Klan” and called Trump “dangerous.” But he wants Florida voters to believe that his vote for Trump is possible to justify. Rubio clearly knows what he’s doing is wrong. He just cares more about his own future in the Republican party than he does about the country."
100500,1001,Donald Trump calls on his goons to stop 'other communities' from stealing the election,http://www.dailykos.com/stories/2016/10/11/1580944/-Donald-Trump-calls-on-his-goons-to-stop-other-communities-from-stealing-the-election,19,"Donald Trump is going to lose this election, and he's going to lose ugly. And if he has his way, violently. He was back in Pennsylvania Monday, more unhinged than ever, if there's such a thing. But what he was very, very clear about was the whistle dogs, cats, birds, fish and racist humans could all here. Those ""other communities"" are going to try to steal the election.

""So important that you get out and vote. So important that you watch other communities, because we don't want this election stolen from us,"" Trump said in Ambridge, Pa., northwest of Pittsburgh. ""We don't want this election stolen from us. We do not want this election stolen."" […]
Later, he spoke from Wilkes-Barre. […]

""And we have to make sure we're protected. We have to make sure the people of Philadelphia are protected that the vote counts are 100 percent. Everybody wants that, but I hear these horror shows. I hear these horror shows and we have to make sure that this election is not stolen from us and is not taken away from us. And everybody knows what I'm talking about.""
Those ""other communities"" are basically Philadelphia, and communities that are predominantly black. Because, you see, Ambridge and Wilkes-Barre are predominantly—about 75 percent—white. And the Trump rally attendance is about 99 percent white. So when he says ""other,"" he's being very, very clear. By the way, ""Republican inspector of elections in Philadelphia debunked Sean Hannity on the subject of voter fraud in the city when the Fox News personality raised it earlier this year."" But nothing is ever debunked with Trump, and he wants his forces to go to Philadelphia and keep those people out of the polls. Which our own Adam Bonin points out is illegal in the state of Pennsylvania.

It's a continuation of Trump's incendiary rhetoric about how the election is rigged, how ""they're letting people pour into the country so they can go and vote."" He's been recruiting what he calls ""poll watchers"" for weeks, people he's getting riled up to get out and stop ""those"" ""other"" voters. Most of his calls for voter suppression have been in Pennsylvania, but his supporters across the country hear that, and are likely to act.

This comes with the first presidential election in five decades without the protections of the Voting Rights Act. That means it comes without the protection of hundreds of poll observers and monitors trained and authorized to monitor polling places by the federal government. 

The air might come entirely out of Trump's balloon even with the most rabid of his current crowd, and this might come to nothing. Or it could be even more ugly and violent than Trump's rallies. We have to be prepared.

100501,1001,How bad is it for Donald Trump? Let's do the math,http://www.dailykos.com/stories/2016/10/11/1580911/-How-bad-is-it-for-Donald-Trump-Let-s-do-the-math,19,"Even before news broke this weekend about Donald Trump’s 2005 Access Hollywood tapes, he had been receiving some extremely bleak polling numbers. As of today, Trump trails Hillary Clinton by 9 points in Virginia, by 8 points in Pennsylvania, by 6 points in Colorado, by 4 points in Florida, and by 3 points in North Carolina.

When we run all of these polls though our presidential forecasting model, it predicts that Trump has less than a 10 percent chance of winning the presidency.

Those are long odds. But they follow from the data. Here’s why our model is able to make such a strong prediction—and why we’re not the only forecasters to see the race this way.

Our model starts by forecasting the outcome of the presidential election in all 50 states and Washington, D.C., and then aggregates those results up to a national forecast. As expected, the polls show that there are a range of states that are “safe” for either Clinton or Trump—that is, where one candidate has at least a 99 percent chance of winning. But given our uncertainty about what could happen between now and Election Day, there also are states like Nevada, Ohio, and Iowa that could go either way. The full set of probabilities that Clinton or Trump will win each state are in the left sidebar on our presidential election overview page.

The next step is to convert all of these state probabilities into an overall chance that Clinton or Trump will win the election. For the sake of illustration, the simplest way to do this is to randomly simulate each state’s election outcome a large number of times and record the winner. From our current estimates, Clinton would win Nevada in 63 percent of simulations, Ohio in 46 percent of simulations, and so on. Again for ease, assume that the state outcomes are independent, so that whether Clinton wins Nevada has no bearing on whether she also wins Ohio. This isn’t completely realistic—and in fact, it’s not how our model works—but it’s a sufficient approximation. In each simulation, the candidate who wins each state receives all of that state’s electoral votes, which we add across all 50 states and D.C.

If we follow this procedure with our current set of state probabilities, Clinton comes out ahead in 99 percent of simulations. That is, in only 1 out of every 100 simulated elections does Donald Trump receive 270 or more electoral votes, and win the election. Clinton’s lead is so substantial that if we count up the electoral votes in the states she’s most likely to win, she gets to 273 by winning Colorado—an outcome that our model estimates is 94 percent likely.

On the other hand, finding a permutation of states that is consistent with the polling data and that gets Trump to 270 electoral votes is extremely difficult. In his most favorable scenario, Trump would have to win Colorado, where he only has a 6 percent chance, and Florida, where has has a 20 percent chance, and North Carolina, where he has a 35 percent chance, and Nevada, where he has a 37 percent chance, and every other state where his level of support is higher. If Trump loses any single one of these states, Clinton wins the election.

The other major forecasting models aren’t any more favorable to Trump’s chances. If we take the probabilities of winning each state currently being forecasted by The Upshot, FiveThirtyEight, The Huffington Post, PredictWise, and the Princeton Election Consortium, and run them through the same simulation, the result is nearly identical: Clinton’s implied chances of winning the national election are close to 100 percent:

FiveThirtyEight: 98 percent
The Upshot: 97 percent
The Huffington Post: 99 percent
Princeton Election Consortium: 98 percent
PredictWise: 99 percent
The distributions of simulated electoral votes for Hillary Clinton under each model—again, by simply taking the state forecasts at face value—reinforce the challenge Trump faces. In every one of the models’ electoral vote histograms, there are almost no outcomes to the left of the blue line at 269 electoral votes, which is what Trump would need to win. These histograms—and the chances of Clinton winning—are different from what each model is actually reporting as their national-level forecast because, like us, none of the other forecasters assume that state election outcomes are independent. If the polls are wrong, or if there’s a national swing in voter preferences toward Trump, then his odds should increase in many states at once: Nevada, Ohio, Florida, and so forth.

This adds extra uncertainty to the forecast, which widens the plausible range of electoral vote outcomes, and lowers Clinton’s chances of winning. The additional assumptions of The Upshot model, for example, bring Clinton’s overall chances down to 87 percent. In the FiveThirtyEight model, Clinton’s chances drop to 84 percent; and their histogram in particular looks very different than what I plotted above. (The Upshot recently published a pair of articles that explored these modeling choices more thoroughly.)

What this demonstrates, though, is that at this point in the campaign, the disagreements between the presidential models’ forecasts are primarily due to differences in the way uncertainty is carried through from the state forecasts to the national forecast. It is not that any of the forecasting models have a fundamentally more pro-Trump interpretation of the data. The models are essentially in agreement. Donald Trump is extremely unlikely to win the presidential election. "
100502,1002,James Pinkerton – The October Surprises: Donald Trump and Mike Pence Remind Us that This Is a Change Election,http://www.breitbart.com/big-government/2016/10/11/the-october-surprises-donald-trump-and-mike-pence-remind-us-that-this-is-a-change-election/,19,"1. The October Surprise

Remember the “October Surprise”? I sure do. Back in the 1980 presidential campaign, the October Surprise was the rumor that the incumbent president, Jimmy Carter, vexed as he was by the Iranian hostage crisis, would pull off some shocking ploy—such as gaining the sudden release of the hostages—as a way of winning that year’s November election. That October Surprise never happened, of course, and maybe we’ll never really know if it was ever anything more than a figment of someone’s imagination.

And yet as we all do know, in that year, 1980, it was Ronald Reagan, not Carter, who triumphed. In fact, Reagan won in a landslide. Still, the notion of some big game-changer happening in October has reverberated in every presidential election since.

This year, 2016, October has only just begun, and so we don’t yet know what shockeroo might be in store for us. Yet it’s a cinch that something surprising will happen, because, well, that’s the way the world works. Indeed, just on Monday morning, we got an ominous indicator of what could be in the offing; the Iranians fired two missiles at a U.S. ship off the coast of Yemen in the Middle East. (The missiles missed, and there were no American casualties).

Of course, we already know that on October 4, to the surprise of the pundits Mike Pence clearly won his vice presidential debate against Tim Kaine. Yes, as we all saw, Pence was calm and cool, while Kaine was overcaffeinated and overheated.  And we also know that in the second presidential debate on October 10, Donald Trump put the hammer down on Hillary Clinton—“You should be ashamed of yourself; you should be in jail.” It’s fair to say that the political class didn’t see either of those events coming; those two victories in the debates were, yes, October surprises. Looking ahead a month to Election Day, November 8, one hesitates to make any sort of prediction; after all, the news cycle—in reality, a continuous news stream—is so fast and furious now that who can say what impressions the voters will have in their heads as they go to the polls. So instead, one must settle for piecing together clues and portents. And I will say this: The  parallels between 1980 and 2016 are strong. 

Indeed, I have particularly sharp recollections of the 1980 presidential election, because I was there: I was a twenty-something peon in the policy operation at the Reagan headquarters, first known as Reagan for President in Los Angeles, and later, in Arlington, VA, as the Reagan-Bush campaign.

To be sure, my duties were humble; mostly, I answered letters and helped fill out questionnaires, along with making frequent runs to the library—because that’s what you had to do back then to check facts in the pre-Internet era. (One of my missions was a trip to the Library of Congress to gather material on the legal power of the president to unilaterally impose wage-and-price controls: Yes, the theory that Carter would suddenly announce a drastic governmental response to the double-digit inflation of that era was yet another rumored “October Surprise.”)

2. “Change” vs. “More of the Same.”

We might consider: In that long-ago national contest, the two main choices were Democrat Jimmy Carter and Republican Ronald Reagan. And as in all elections, the big question was whether the voters wanted “change,” or “more of the same.”

In elections, as we know, sometimes “change” wins, sometimes “more of the same” wins—that’s up to the voters. In that long-ago year, of course, “change” emerged triumphant—although, as we shall see, it was touch-and-go almost right up till Election Day.

Carter, of course, was in the White House, and so he had the advantage of incumbency.  That is, he had the national megaphone, as well as all the trappings of presidential prestige. Yet Carter also had the disadvantage of incumbency. That is, he had a record to defend, and it wasn’t pretty.

Still, at the beginning of the year, 1980, according to Gallup, Reagan was down by as much as 30 points. Indeed, the Gipper didn’t pull ahead until late October—and then he really surged, winning on November 4 by almost ten points, carrying 44 states.

So now to today: Hillary Clinton is the incumbent, and her record also isn’t pretty.  Okay, strictly speaking, she isn’t the incumbent, but she might as well be; she’s an alumna of the Obama administration, and she has all of its top officials actively helping her, including the President, the First Lady, and the Vice President. Indeed, Barack Obama has said that he will consider it to be a personal insult to him if Trump wins.

In addition, of course, Hillary suffers from the accumulated weight of the Clinton presidency; indeed, the 42nd president himself has never left the national stage. And while in the minds of some, Bill Clinton’s presence is an asset, that was before he called Obamacare “the craziest thing in the world,” and before the Trump campaign brought some of his past sexual victims to St. Louis for a pre-debate panel discussion.

To be sure, the MSM did its best to ignore Clinton victims—in keeping with its see-no-evil approach of the last quarter-century. Yet the Trump campaign was able to bypass the MSM filter by “broadcasting” the poignant event, along with interviews, through the new online media.  So we can see: Only now is Bill Clinton getting the payback he has always deserved. And to the extent that Hillary was, and is, his enabler and co-conspirator, she, too, is getting her just desserts.

In the meantime, down below the commanding heights, out there in Flyover Country, everyone knows about the stagnating economy, as well as the foreign policy challenges and debacles that worsened during Clinton’s tenure as Secretary of State. Moreover, there’s the recent spike in terrorism and violence in New York, Charlotte, Dallas, Baton Rouge—and, of course, the steady flow of blood gushing in just about every big city.

So it’s little wonder that a CBS News poll from mid-September found that 55 percent of Americans want “big changes,” while 43 percent want “some changes”; just two percent think things are fine the way they are. We need hardly add the  observation: If 98 percent of the voters are favoring “change,” it will be hard for this not to be a “change” election.

Then the CBS poll asked: Which candidate can be trusted to change Washington? The answer: 47 percent trust Trump to do it, 20 percent trust Clinton to do it.  In other words, Trump owns the “change” issue by a whopping 27-point margin. In a “change” year, that’s the stuff of landslides—as was 1980.

So today, when I see the polls showing Trump behind, I just smile: If the voters mean it when they say that they want change, well, then, they will get change—whether or not the pollsters can see it coming.

Meanwhile, the larger context of the times back then argued strongly for change—drastic change. At home, we were suffering from severe inflation and rising unemployment. At the same time, abroad, the Carter administration suffered the daily indignity of the Iranian hostage crisis.  And elsewhere, Carter haplessly confronted the strategic challenges of the Soviet-aided communist victory in Nicaragua and the Russians’ outright invasion of Afghanistan.

So it was little wonder that, according to a Gallup poll, satisfaction with the condition of the country hit a rock-bottom 12 percent in the summer of 1979, and it stayed down in the teens all through 1980.

Yet for all that dissatisfaction, for almost the whole of 1980, it was no certainty that the voters would choose Reagan over Carter. After all, much like Trump today, Reagan was loathed by the media, and that depressed his numbers—or so we thought.

3. The Media vs. Republicans: The Song Remains the Same

Moreover, back then, there was no alternative media, and so what we now think of as the Main Stream Media was just…the media. You know, as in the broadcast networks, The New York Times, and The Los Angeles Times. These outlets might not seem that important today—it’s perfectly possible to get all the news one wants without ever visiting a legacy site, and the LA Times is one of many newspapers to have gone through bankruptcy—and yet in those days, the longstanding media outlets were seemingly all-powerful.

So on every morning at Reagan campaign HQ, top people had already read a hard-copy version of The New York Times or The Washington Post; a little later, the same people would receive the clips—a thick batch of photocopies of news articles mailed or faxed from around the country. And at 6:30 pm, and again at 7 pm, everything would stop, because we all had to see how the campaign was playing on the nightly newscasts, which in those days were watched by most of the country.

Of course, we usually gritted our teeth as we watched, because the TV reporters, like the print reporters, despised Reagan; almost all of them regarded him as a crazy, maybe even senile, cowboy who would get us not only into a depression, but also into World War Three. (Carter, in their mind, was a well-intentioned failure; that was hardly a ringing endorsement, to be sure, but in the journalistic mind, Carter’s weakness paled compared to Reagan’s menace.)

So with Reagan being savaged every morning and every evening, it wasn’t surprising that our polling was dismal.  A Gallup Poll from early January, for example, showed Carter leading Reagan by a nearly two-to-one margin, 62 percent to 33 percent.

That was the paradox: The American people knew that things were going badly, but the media kept insisting that there was no alternative other than to vote for Carter.

4. Third Parties, and Fourth Parties

Yet then an alternative that the media deemed to be plausible did emerge. That was Rep. John B. Anderson (R-IL). Anderson had run a quixotic campaign in the ’80 GOP primaries as a tax-increasing, arms-controlling liberal. He didn’t win a single Republican primary, and yet the media fell in love with him, loving him all the more when he devoted himself entirely to bashing Reagan and the GOP.

And so, riding that wave of media enthusiasm, Anderson abandoned the Republicans and opted for an independent run for the White House. In fact, mindful of his new political base, he positioned himself to the left of not only Reagan, but also of Carter. And for a while, it was working for him; according to Gallup, he reached 24 percent in June.

Yet once the media realized that Anderson, by now a leftist, was drawing more votes away from Carter than from Reagan, most reporters turned against him. And so then, deprived of his media halo, he slid down to less than seven percent on Election Day.

Looking back at the Anderson boomlet, we can see what was happening in the electorate: Many Republicans, or Republican-leaning independents, were leery of voting for Reagan, and so they “parked” themselves with Anderson as they evaluated the two major-party candidates more closely. And then, in the end, a lot of them did vote for Reagan.

So in a way, the Anderson surge in ’80 was a precursor of what we’re seeing this year.  In 2016, the role of Anderson is being played, in effect, by two other liberal Republicans, former governor Gary Johnson of New Mexico and former governor Bill Weld of Massachusetts. Strictly speaking, Johnson and Weld are the Libertarian Party’s presidential and vice-presidential nominees, but they have scored well—as high as 12 percent in some polls—because they have served as a “safe haven” for many Republicans who dislike Trump and yet can’t bring themselves to support Hillary.

Weld, in particular, cuts a distinctly John Anderson-type profile; that is, he is a Republican deeply opposed to the dominant conservative faction. And as  for Johnson, he himself was mostly a conservative when holding office in the 90s; and yet since then, he has chosen to focus his post-gubernatorial career, as well as his ’16 campaign, on the legalization and mass-marketing of marijuana. Thus in the context of today, both Weld and Johnson are firmly on the John Anderson-type left.

Indeed, as with Anderson in 1980, that’s probably why the Libertarian ticket is suddenly receiving so much criticism; the MSM has figured out that these third-partiers are draining more votes from the Democrat than the Republican. Can’t have that! And since Anderson then, and Johnson today, have been mostly media creations, it’s little surprise that as their media support ebbs, so, too, does their political support.

5. Four More Years?  Really??

Meanwhile, back in 1980, the big issue was the condition of the country. On July 17, in his acceptance speech to the Republican national convention in Detroit, Reagan finally had his opportunity to speak to the bulk of the American electorate, unfiltered by the media. And in the course of making his overall case for change, he deftly jabbed at Carter:

Can anyone look at the record of this administration and say, “Well done?” Can anyone compare the state of our economy when the Carter Administration took office with where we are today and say, “Keep up the good work?” Can anyone look at our reduced standing in the world today and say, “Let’s have four more years of this?”

Thus with the whole country watching, Reagan framed the key issue: Carter equaled “more of the same”; Reagan equaled “change.”

For his part, Carter had no new ideas for the future; he was truly the more-of-the-same candidate.  In addition, he didn’t have much of a record to run on, and he knew that, too.  So his plan, instead, was to demolish Reagan—just as Hillary today is attempting to demolish Trump.  In his August 14, 1980 acceptance speech to the Democratic national convention in New York, Carter ripped into his challenger and all Republicans:

In their fantasy America, all problems have simple solutions—simple and wrong.  It’s a make-believe world, a world of good guys and bad guys, where some politicians shoot first and ask questions later.  No hard choices, no sacrifice, no tough decisions—it sounds too good to be true, and it is.

For a while, this strategy of ripping up Reagan appeared to be working. Gallup records that in early August, Carter was ahead of Reagan by sixteen points, 45:29. For purposes of comparison, we can note that on August 9 of this year, according to the RealClearPolitics polling average, Clinton was ten points ahead of Trump.

Yet back in 1980, for all the reasons noted, the country wanted change. And so by mid-August, Reagan had pulled to within a single point of Carter, and the two candidates stayed neck-and-neck all through September.

So if we might skip ahead 36 years, that’s almost exactly where we are today: According to the RealClearPolitics average, as of October 10, Clinton is 4.5 points ahead of Trump in the four-way race. So we might recall: Clinton is almost exactly where Carter was at this time, 36 years ago.

6.  When Democrats Attack

Meanwhile, back in 1980, Carter chose to intensify his fusillade against Reagan: On October 6, he declared that a Reagan victory would fracture the country; speaking in Michigan, he told the voters,

You’ll determine whether or not this America will be unified, or if I lose this election whether America might be separated—black from white, Jew from Christian, North from South, rural from urban.

Here we might pause to observe that it might seem, well, unseemly for the incumbent to do nothing but attack the challenger. And yet that was what Carter chose to do; he obviously had no confidence in the political viability of his own record. And in fact, for a while, Carter’s attack-attack-attack plan seemed to be working; by mid-October, the Georgian had pulled ahead— according to Gallup, he was now up by five points.

Then, on October 28, came the lone Carter-Reagan debate. To read the transcript, one might think that Carter performed well. Here’s a typical passage, from the well-briefed and highly detail-oriented Carter:

We now are planning to continue the revitalization program with increased commitments of rapid transit, mass transit.  Under the windfall profits tax, we expect to spend about $43 billion in the next 10 years to rebuild the transportation systems of our country. We also are pursuing housing programs.  We’ve had a 73 percent increase in the allotment of Federal funds for improved education.  These are the kinds of efforts worked on a joint basis with community leaders, particularly in the minority areas of the central cities that have been deteriorating so rapidly in the past.

Note not only the farrago of statistics, but also the systematic base-touching:  “mass transit,” “housing programs,” “improved education,” “community leaders, particularly in the minority areas of the central cities.” (Carter didn’t stop to explain why it was that those minority areas were “deteriorating so rapidly” during his presidency—in the same way that Hillary today doesn’t acknowledge the recent worsening of urban conditions under the policies that she not only favors, but wishes to accelerate.)

For his part, in the same debate, Reagan made an entirely different sort of argument. He wasn’t interested in piling up data points; instead, he was interested in changing the country:

I believe the Presidency is what Teddy Roosevelt said it was. It’s a bully pulpit. And I think that something can be done from there, because a goal for all of us should be that one day, things will be done neither because of nor in spite of any of the differences between us—ethnic differences or racial differences, whatever they may be—that we will have total equal opportunity for all people.  And I would do everything I could in my power to bring that about.

Yet Carter had his nuke-Reagan plan all laid out, and he kept at it throughout the debate. The 39th president relentlessly zeroed in on perceived Reagan weaknesses, hoping to catch the Republican in some nitpicky error. And that’s when Reagan responded with his famous retort, “There you go again.” With those four words, combining humor and dismissiveness, Reagan stamped Carter as what he was—a small-minded factoid-monger filling out the remaining days of his failed presidency.

Later that night, Democratic spin doctors—in and out of the media—didn’t want to admit it, but everyone knew that Reagan had won the debate. Yes, Carter had spewed out his almanac of trivia, but even he couldn’t make his record in the White House look good.

In other words, Reagan had gone toe-to-toe with the President of the United States and emerged not only as a plausible commander-in-chief, but also as, definitely, the more likable man. And so that’s when the dynamic of a “change” election really kicked in: The dam broke, as voters who had been reluctant to commit now sluiced into Reagan’s reservoir.

The last Gallup poll of the 1980 campaign showed Reagan up three points, 47:44; although as noted earlier, he ended up winning by ten points. To put that another way, although Gallup called the election correctly, it was still off by seven points—and that’s something to keep in mind as the 2016 election nears.

Meanwhile, according to the current-day reminiscences of Marc Rotterman, a fellow Reagan campaigner that year, “Back in 1980, we had a president who had a complete disconnect from the country.”  Rotterman recently gave this pithy encapsulation of Carter:

He had no understanding of what it would take to move the country forward.  Most Americans thought that their personal situation would get worse with another four years of Carter—and so they voted for our guy.

Then Rotterman, who lives in Raleigh, North Carolina, and has carved out a long career in Republican political consulting, mostly in the Tarheel State, added a direct warning to Democrats about the current rioting in Charlotte, underscoring the importance of the “change” theme: “Law and order is going to be a key component of this election, and that spells trouble for Clinton and the Democrats.” To put that another way: Will the Democrats be the party of “more of the same” when it comes to disorder and terror? If so, that looks like a political loser.

7. The Choice

Indeed, we can all step back and ask: This November, will the country vote to renew its commitment to the sort of laxity that enables foreign terrorists to enter the country, even as others take to the streets to loot and burn? If the voters do reward chaos, it will contradict all historical precedent.

That’s the challenge to Hillary: Like Carter before her, she knows better than to run on overt “four more years” agenda, and so, instead, she figures that she must knock Trump out of the box with negative attacks—and coordinate her barrage, of course, with the MSM.

And in defense of her tactics, we might ask: What else can she do? She is trying, of course, to run on the Obama record—offering her presidency, in effect, as his third term. But does that really seem like a winning message?

However, she can’t run on her record, because, as Trump says to great effect, her 30 years in public life about to “all talk, no action.”

And she can’t run on Bill Clinton’s record for many reasons, starting with the fact the trade deals he championed are now in disrepute, and ending, as we have seen, with the sudden re-emergence of his own past sexual indiscretions—and have we mentioned the Clinton Foundation?

Finally, she can’t run on the Democratic platform published in Philadelphia; that was the most left-wing major-party platform in history—does she really want to get into a discussion of open borders in a time such as this?

No, not a one of those options are attractive for her. Thus she is left with just one last option—attack.

Happily for Hillary’s mindset, the first-strike-on-Trump plan fits with her own personal needs; she seems to have worked up a strong personal hatred for the New Yorker. In fact, as we all know, Hillary has extended her contempt for Trump to contempt for his supporters—all those “deplorables.”

Indeed, her fast-multiplying hatreds seems to have, well, made her a bit crazy, or at least crazed-looking.  On September 21, The Drudge Report linked to a Washington Post story on a Hillary campaign video with the headline, “Manic.”  Yes, manic is a good word to describe her demeanor in that video. And that particular story, by the way, was headlined, “Clinton asks why she isn’t beating Trump by 50 points.”  Yes, she really said it: “Why aren’t I 50 points ahead?” In other words, Hillary is visibly exasperated at the thought of having a close contest with Trump; this hasn’t been the cakewalk that her advisers promised her. (We might also recall that an earlier set of advisers had promised her a cakewalk in 2008.)

Yet we might pause to note that the largest presidential landslide in American history, in 1920, was 26 points, or barely more than half of the victory margin that Hillary has been hoping for.

And so we’re left to contemplate, with mind-boggled awe, Hillary’s soaring sense of entitlement. It’s one thing that she would think that she deserves to win by 50 points; it’s quite another to say it out loud in an official campaign video. Thus we all can gain a clue about the nature of the cocoon in which she has been living—it’s a cocoon with thick walls. And we can surmise: No wonder she didn’t think that U.S. government rules about e-mail, or foundation ethics, or Benghazi truth-telling, applied to her.

So now our comparison of 1980 and 2016 must end—we have to let the election play out. Quite possibly, just as was the lone Carter-Reagan presidential debate in ‘80, the next Clinton-Trump debate, to be held on October 19, will be decisive. Yes, Trump is behind, but as we have seen, in a “change” year, if the challenger can make himself seem acceptable to undecided voters, then the tide of change will sweep him into the White House.

And we also know this: Since Hillary can’t run on her record, can’t run on her vision for the future, and certainly can’t run on her own personal probity, then, like Carter before her, she has only one choice: Attack. That’s what she did Sunday night in St. Louis, that’s what all her campaign surrogates are doing and will be doing, and, of course, that’s what the MSM is and will be doing.

Yes, it’s a big gamble for Clinton. Despite her best efforts to tear him down—and in spite of some self-inflicted wounds—Trump is still standing. That is, it’s not so clear that her billions of dollars’ worth of anti-Trump messaging is having the desired effect. But then, as we have seen, there’s nothing else she can do.  So it’s double-down time: attack, attack, attack.

So it’s fitting that the October 19 debate will be held in Las Vegas. Hillary may seem like the front runner, but the winds of change are blowing against her, hard. So she will need all the luck she can get, because even if the Clinton campaign has become utterly predictable, the voters are rarely predictable—they can always pull a November Surprise."
100503,1002,Pamela Geller on the Trump Video: Liberals Suddenly Discover Morality,http://www.breitbart.com/2016-presidential-race/2016/10/11/pamela-geller-trump-video-liberals-suddenly-discover-morality/,19,"Donald Trump was caught on video making some naughty remarks, and the political and media elites are in an uproar – an orgy of hypocrisy.
This is much ado about nothing. It’s how guys talk. Nevertheless, the Washington Post crowed: “With less than a month to go, a major party is walking away from its nominee.” No, the people are walking away from the party. If the GOP abandons Donald Trump now — a month before the election — there will be no coming back from that. One month to go and these vicious cowards jump ship?

John McCain, Mark Kirk, Kelly Ayotte, George Pataki – RINOs who never stood up for conservative principles are the Republicans disavowing Trump now. The GOP will not recover from this. We had to swallow their failures — RINO McCain, spineless weak sister Mitt Romney — and we did. We worked hard to elect them, but they were and are failures. The people picked Trump over the objections of the elites. And the elites would rather set our house on fire than back the people’s candidate.

If the elite right went after the opposition the way they’ve gone after Trump, they wouldn’t be limping their way to oblivion.

The uproar over Trump’s remarks is manufactured and opportunistic outrage. For example, I was actually surprised by the decorum in Trump’s conversation. He was respectful of the married woman’s refusal. He was surprised that if you’re famous, you can get all the sex you want. He was unashamedly heterosexual in his desires. He wanted to grab p—y, not force someone’s head “down” a la Bill Clinton. He appreciates “beautiful” and wants to kiss her face, not have her immediately perform oral sex a la Bill Clinton, and he wants to be pleasing to her with Tic Tacs for his breath — very considerate. A pass, a kiss, is not rape. For that, you’d have to ask Juanita Broaddrick.

The gross betrayal is not Trump’s alpha male banter, but these turncoats in the party. Did they ever take such a defiant stand against the treasonous actions of Obama and his running dogs? Trump is an alpha male. Gutless, weak metrosexuals like Barack Obama have almost destroyed America, and now the world is in chaos because of their actions. Trump was quite right – this is all a diversion from the real issues. He said in his statement:

Let’s be honest — we’re living in the real world. This is nothing more than a distraction from the important issues we’re facing today. We are losing our jobs, we’re less safe than we were eight years ago, and Washington is totally broken. Hillary Clinton and her kind have run our country into the ground.

I’ve said some foolish things, but there’s a big difference between the words and actions of other people. Bill Clinton has actually abused women, and Hillary has bullied, attacked, shamed and intimidated his victims.

There is no comparison between Trump and the Clintons. None. Not only has Bill Clinton abused women. Hillary Clinton routinely abuses her secret service detail, once screaming at an agent: “If you want to remain on this detail, get your f***ing ass over here and grab those bags!” When one said to her, “Good morning, ma’am,” she replied: “F**k off! It’s enough that I have to see you ****-kickers every day, Just do your G*damn job and keep your mouth shut.”

The selective outrage is astonishing. The liberals corrupted the culture. No one cares. Trump looks cool. They live by the sword and they will die by the sword. All of a sudden the liberals are prudish? Barack Obama says, “Gotta have them ribs and p—y too,” and crickets don’t even bother to chirp. On the same day that the “shocked” Washington Post released the naughty Trump video, they ran a front-of-the-book news story how cyber-policing hurts prostitutes.

Hollywood, too? Who stood by and did nothing why child actors were raped and trafficked? Hollywood actors and their sexcapades make Donald Trump look like a choirboy.

Then there are the rappers, the darlings of the establishment that are shocked at what Trump said. “Got that super soaker, p*ssy pop like cola coka/Plus it’s tighter than a choka, got ’em smilin’ like the Joka” –Trump just got the Nicki Minaj voters. “Imagine if I did that with your pearly on my tongue / I make that p*ssy talk to me / I could make it jump” — Trump will attract Lil Wayne voters. “She make that assclap dancing like she on d–Bring it back I thru a stack, that’s a lucky bitch” — Trump gets the Juicy J featuring, 2 Chainz and Lil Wayne vote. Kanye West said: “I feel like Taylor Swift still owe me sex / Why? I made that bitch famous.” The Trump video will attract the Kimye vote.

Trump must prevail. Trump has stood against Muslim migration. The consequences for American women if uncontrolled migration continues to take place will be far worse than Trump’s macho talk.

It’s the end of us — the end of freedom – if Hillary Clinton becomes President."
100504,1002,"Rick Manning: Dear Hillary, What Difference Does It Make If Russia Was the Source of WikiLeaks?",http://www.breitbart.com/2016-presidential-race/2016/10/11/rick-manning-dear-hillary-what-difference-does-it-make-if-russia-was-the-source-of-wikileaks/,19,"Apparently, everything is Vladimir Putin’s fault in Hillary’s alternative universe.
It makes one wonder what Hillary meant when she declared a reset in U.S.-Russian relations — something she bragged about in the second presidential debate — way back when she was Secretary of State. Now after her “reset,” she blames Vladimir Putin for every revelation that comes out from WikiLeaks about the inner workings of her campaign machine. Apparently, she has reset the Russians right back to the 1950s and 60’s. She is even going so far as to push our nation to the edge of war with Russia in Syria as she is urging that the U.S. impose a no-fly zone in the region that would bring U.S. airmen into direct combat action against Russian pilots to enforce it. Now, that’s a Back to the Future sequel that I can do without.

But at least the Clinton blame game theme is the same as it ever was, as she creates a tenuous discrediting argument against someone or something, like Putin and Wikileaks, as the source of the information shifting people’s attention, magician-like, away from the leak’s damaging content, and onto the purported leaker.  This way every revelation is tainted under suspicion of its origin rather than being evaluated on its own face value as to the damage it might have done to the country or more importantly to Hillary, to her political career.

It is almost silly in its application, if you want to make Democratic National Committee email leaks showing that the primary was being rigged by Debbie Wasserman Schultz on behalf of Hillary against Bernie Sanders go away? It is easy peasy, the media makes it invisible because of the claim that Putin leaked it and is trying to influence the U.S. presidential election, and suddenly Hillary doesn’t have to answer the question as to whether she legitimately won the nomination.

As the latest WikiLeaks has revealed that Hillary complained in a paid, behind closed doors speech to Wall Street executives that Russia was funding “fake environmental groups” to stop energy development, the purported Russian source of the leak makes any questions about these “fake environmental groups” suddenly off limits.

After all, everyone knows that former spymaster Vladimir Putin would foolishly out his covert operation in an attempt to embarrass Hillary rather than delete those emails before the leak. It seems that in Hillary’s world only one politician is smart enough to delete embarrassing and criminal emails. Once whitewashed by the compliant media, Hillary will be able to avoid the obvious question about which enviro groups she believes are fake, and be asked to name all the environmental groups that have received Russian money to influence American energy policy. Of course it would also be good to know if any of these “Russian” funded groups were actively supporting her presidential campaign, because that would be real intervention by a foreign power into our electoral system. Unfortunately, that question is unlikely to be asked or answered as we will have already been urged to move on.

Hillary’s Benghazi whopper though may take the cake for her blame passing obfuscation game.  According to released emails between Hillary and her daughter, on the night of the attack while Americans were still battling for their lives, the Secretary of State asserted that Al Qaeda was behind that September 11 attack all the while pushing Susan Rice out the door to the media for the next week blaming the deaths of those four Americans on the reaction to a YouTube video that no one had ever seen. The YouTube blame landed the video producer in jail for about a year, and after years of stonewalling every investigation, Hillary famously exclaimed, “at this point, what difference does it make?”

And that in a nutshell is how Hillary deals with the daily swirl of crisis and corruption that surrounds her.  She blames someone or something else, fights tenaciously to keep her lie accepted by a friendly media, finally offers a tepid apology, and then ends by urging everyone to move on, as the issue has been dealt with already.

In fact, the far left advocacy group MoveOn.org was created using this model, as their name refers to the grassroots effort they pushed on Clinton’s behalf urging the nation to stop paying attention to Bill Clinton’s White House intern problem and the trail of abused women he left in his wake and focus on other things. And with the see no evil, hear no evil, speak no evil Clinton media, the simple distraction trick works like a charm.

The irony that Hillary is trying to get the public to dwell on a leaked video from one of her corporate sponsors, NBC, that puts her opponent in a bad light due to more than a decade old crude sexual comment, all the while hoping the public forgets about her past role in viciously attacking her husband’s sexual assault victims will be lost on the humorless left. A group that is so used to chanting “move on” in regards to Clinton corruption that they might get whiplash from this latest change in direction.

The moral of the story is, when Hillary is blaming someone, chances are she is hiding something else.  In the case of the latest Wikileaks disclosures, she is hiding it in plain sight."
100505,1003,The Problem With A ‘Strongman’,http://www.huffingtonpost.com/carlosgonzalez/the-problem-with-a-strongman_b_12436494.html?utm_hp_ref=politics,19,"When I hear the word used as a positive attribute in reference to Donald J. Trump, I shudder. I come from a country that was ruled by a strongman for fourteen years. Democracy was not made for “strongmen”. Democracy in itself is flawed, in that democracy, without the inviolability of a strong constitution, is meaningless. Hugo Chávez, the late president of Venezuela, was elected by a democratic majority but as soon as he took office declared on national television that the constitution was just for reference. And so the assault on the Magna Carta began and it is now unrecognizable, as is the country.

We, in South America, are experts in “strongmen”. Augusto Pinochet, Fidel Castro, Alfredo Stroessner, Hugo Chávez - left or right - the list is long. What is evident about the “strongmen”, is that it’s a cult to their personalities and not their policies. Hugo Chávez was not elected because of his policies, but because of is appeal to a huge swath of the population that felt mis- or under-represented and because he was an “outsider.” But I will stop with the comparisons now, the United States is not Venezuela. But I thought something very similar when Chávez first ran, Venezuela is not Cuba. I can’t say my foresight was very good.

“If I win, I am going to instruct my attorney general to get a special prosecutor to look into your situation because there has never been so many lies, so much deception,” Mr. Trump said in the second debate. He threatened to put Secretary Clinton in jail if elected. As Michael Chertoff, secretary of Homeland Security and head of the Justice Department’s criminal division under George W. Bush, said in the New York Times, “It’s a chilling thought. It smacks of what we read about tin-pot dictators in other parts of the world, where when they win an election their first move is to imprison opponents.”

But what’s unsettling about this situation, is the thundering applause of those he appeals to. Mr. Trump, with the support of his followers, has threatened the constitution and the rule of law in this country, and that should not be taken lightly. He has encouraged violence against demonstrators, he has proposed a ban based on religion, and attacked an American judge, issuing threats and falsely saying he was Mexican. He undermines the American democratic system by saying it’s rigged and setting the stage for the “great fraud” committed upon him that will cost him the election. He is recruiting “election observers” to show up at the polls, reminiscent of Chávez’s red-shirted “motorizados” circling the polls on their motorcycles in a threatening manner on election day.

Mr. Trump’s support does not come from his policies, few and vague at best, but from his personality, his persona, his very troubling persona. Racism, misogyny, lack of general knowledge, all forgiven because he is an “outsider” and is rattling the establishment. This is very ugly, and it’s rattling more than the establishment, it’s rattling the moral and democratic core of this country.

Thankfully, though sometimes detrimental as shown in the last eight years, the American system has enough checks and balances to keep a president from achieving anything. I have issues with the American system, especially with the electorate college that disenfranchises millions every election cycle, where a Republican vote means nothing in California and Democratic vote means nothing in Alabama. But it is very strong when it comes to the branches of government, the checks and balances. Very, very strong.

So, I am not terribly worried about the American democratic system collapsing under the rule of an autocratic, megalomaniac. No, I’m worried about the effects of his emergence on the fabric of the country, pitting Americans against Americans, and dividing us based on race, gender, sexual preference or religion. This is the real danger, a terrible change that could last a generation. Chávez changed Venezuela by dividing its citizenry and it didn’t turn out well. Venezuela went from an imperfect two-party democracy to a disaster, far worse than what we had before. The United States is not Venezuela, and Venezuela is not Cuba, but I’ve said that before..."
100506,1003,Trump: The Worst Of Patriarchy,http://www.huffingtonpost.com/deborah-king/trump-the-worst-of-patria_b_12433442.html?utm_hp_ref=politics,19,"The second Presidential Debate solidified my impression of Donald Trump as a misogynist representing the worst of patriarchy, which has been the dominant social system for the last 5,000 years.

In a patriarchal system, men are in charge, controlling leadership in politics, social privilege, family, and property, including total power over women and children. The literal meaning of patriarchy is “the rule of the father.” We are just starting to climb out of this imbalance of power. Birth control, access to abortions, the right to vote, feminists, and a changing social climate have empowered women to stand up to abusive partners and energized them to run for office so they could help to change the moral and legal ramifications of this ancient system. Hillary has been trying to do that for decades; her record of public service clearly shows her hard work for the rights of women and children, famously saying as First Lady in Beijing that “women’s rights are human rights.”

Trump wants to be the ultimate patriarch, the one holding all the power. Hillary really irritates him. A woman shouldn’t know more than he does about policy, about government, about the world, about anything. In patriarchy, women don’t hold power. They are worth less than men, hence, their lower pay rates. They are more likely to be abused. They should stay home and raise the kids. They should be beautiful and sexy (Trump especially likes beautiful women and denigrates those who are fat or “ugly”). In patriarchy, women’s sexuality is there for the taking. This is the personal world Trump lives in and the world he wants for us. This is, in his opinion, what would make America “great” again.

In the second debate, Donald Trump stood menacingly behind Hillary Clinton, trying to overshadow her physically when he was not lashing out at her verbally. His disrespect for her was obvious, as he habitually referred to Clinton as “her” and “she” rather than addressing her by name. He piles misogyny on top of patriarchy. Misogyny is outright contempt for women. Misogyny grabs a woman’s pussy whether she wants it grabbed or not. Misogyny hates having to deal with female moderators in a debate. Misogyny is the “good old boys” network, the “boys will be boys” excuse for bad behavior, the foul language of the “locker room.” Misogyny intends to throw Hillary in jail, even after she has been exonerated by the FBI and a passel of special prosecutors, and throw away the key.

Nations other than the U.S. have had women presidents or prime ministers as elected or appointed heads of state, including our neighbors to the north and south.

When you look at how far behind other countries the U.S. is in education and health care, you can begin to understand why a woman president will make a difference. While Trump made lewd sexual comments about his own daughter, Hillary worked across the aisle to pass a program that covered 8 million children with health care. As soon as she got into the Senate, she helped write laws to make education better and to protect children’s health. As Secretary of State, Hillary met with women in countries around the world and led the U.N. Security Council resolution to combat sexual violence in conflict zones and to advance the rights of the LGBT community. In the meantime, Trump tried to have sex with a married woman while his most current wife was pregnant.

And this patriarchal and misogynist man wants to be president? As decent men and women, we can’t let that happen. As citizens of a world that is just starting to wake up to how women are sexually assaulted and abused around the globe, we can’t let that happen.

If you are in any way undecided about who to vote for less than a month from now, please don’t vote for this dangerous narcissist, with his grandiose perception of himself as being the one person who can fix everything that’s wrong. Don’t give this pompous and arrogant exploiter of others, the one who cares only about himself and his entitlement and personal gain, a bully pulpit from which to bully the world. He’s hot-tempered and dangerous, and imagining him with his finger on the nuclear button should scare the bejeezus out of us all.

This election is crucial. It’s time to stand up and be counted for decency, compassion for others, and your ultimate health and welfare. Get out there. Talk to your family, friends, neighbors, and co-workers. Don’t hide behind complacency or “I don’t do politics.” Get fired up about electing Hillary as if your life depends on it. It does."
100507,1003,The Poisoning of the American Presidential Debates,http://www.huffingtonpost.com/bernard-rowan/the-poisoning-of-the-amer_b_12432138.html?utm_hp_ref=politics,19,"I don’t know about anyone else, but I suspect many a viewing audience member, to say nothing of the studio audience, felt appalled by the display of ad hominem attacks in Sunday’s presidential debate. There was some discussion of policy issues, but the ninety minutes felt like watching a domestic argument, a dysfunctional argument, and to say the least not a presidential debate.

Where have we arrived in American presidential politics? We have arrived at the point of scapegoating and personal vilification on both sides. It’s disgusting, but we must understand it for what it amounts to.

It would have to be hard for any woman or man, in particular those proud of their accomplishments and representing an entire national political party, to stomach the statement that s/he is “a devil” or “would be in jail”, or is “unfit to be President”. Neither Clinton nor Trump is free from criticism.

The literature on all kinds of sociopaths and hyperbolic social movements, to say nothing of allegedly “normal” behavior, is replete with lessons about the absurdity of demonizing political opponents. Scapegoating turns on displacement and projection. Both candidates avoid addressing their own weaknesses and vulnerabilities by trying to say something/s about the other candidate that indict their integrity or humanity, in the case of Trump’s name-calling, in categorical ways.

This is irrational and counter to the purpose of debates. In fact the avoidance of scapegoating is part of the reason the United States was founded - to get away from calling your fellow citizens devil worshippers or idolaters or evil zealots or schismatics or what have you. The truth is that both Trump and Clinton can be President, and one of them likely will be, because each has been nominated by a national political party.

Donald Trump’s campaign is desperate now, and when he’s not forgetting he has a running mate or trying to excuse his own failings, he’s trying to foist Hillary Clinton into the role of criminal and an accomplice in her own victimization at the hands of her husband’s infidelities. I found it sickening.

However, I have to say that I find Clinton’s repeated, as if it’s okay, statements that Trump is unfit to be president equally disgusting. Why should we need to validate her judgment in this regard? The fitness of either candidate to be president is for us as voters to state. We really don’t need her shortcuts to tell us the decision has already been made - by her. She likes to tout her reason and policy acumen as strengths, but she’s more than willing to wallow in the mud with Trump.

I’m also tired of the complete disregard our nation’s highest office candidates have for debate propriety and good rhetoric. If we want to see them act like dominators and try to force their words on each other for 90 minutes, then let them create their own YouTube video and have at it. Then it’s not official and would compete with everything else on the open-air waves.

No, the poisoning of the American presidential debates has occurred on the heels of candidates using free and sponsored media time to act in ways they wouldn’t tolerate from their subordinates, their children, their superiors, and on and on. We’d view similar behavior by all sorts of less prominent people with disregard. Why do they get a pass?

I also think that nearly uniformly, the moderators have failed in their duty to be equal-handed. I haven’t seen one who had the ability to control the debaters, and in some cases the bias is clear. I don’t think they prepared very well, and if they did, they needed more real-world simulation. The media use salacious and mean-spirited false narratives as fodder for ratings and hide behind the excuse that this manufactured news demands attention. The media must accept a lot of responsibility for creating and sustaining these dynamics.

Both candidates say that so much is at stake, but they have made this nation look like a laughing stock with their vitriol, their animosity to each other, and the disrespect it reflects. They obviously think we’re all a bunch of idiots to imbibe their ridiculous behavior.

Our nation will reap the results of the irrationality Trump and Clinton have turned out already. If they care about children and young adults, about creating businesses and make America great again, they should try to be more sober. Their antics teach generations that it’s okay to look like arrogant and self-righteous freaks for the world to absorb, consider, and act on.

Here’s hoping that future debates and future candidates will learn from the mistakes this moment’s “leaders” have displayed. Ideas and rhetoric have consequences. Demagoguery is only a short step away when the candidates lack the conviction to respect their own imperfection. It’s in our faces when we hear them treat each other as beneath contempt.

I hope we’ll all call on Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump to act like Americans, not like rival bullies at a playground of inanity."
100508,1004,Alt-Right Dreams Of Trump Cabinet Full Of White Nationalists As GOP Fractures,http://talkingpointsmemo.com/livewire/alt-right-dreams-up-fantasy-white-nationalist-trump-cabinet,19,"With over two dozen congressional Republicans defecting from their party’s nominee, Donald Trump’s white nationalist supporters see an opening to staff a possible Trump administration with their own kind.

On Saturday, The Guardian attended a meeting of the white nationalist American Freedom Party in Los Angeles, where chairman William Johnson held forth about the ideal members for a Trump cabinet.

“I want Jared Taylor [of American Renaissance] as UN Ambassador, and Kevin MacDonald [an evolutionary psychologist] as secretary of health and Ann Coulter as homeland security,” Johnson said, according to the Guardian.

Johnson told The Guardian that he fantasized about those unlikely choices three months ago during a conversation with alt-right icon Richard Spencer. According to Johnson, Spencer said at the time that having individuals like Taylor, who runs a white nationalist magazine and conference series, in the White House was a “pipe dream.”

Now, however, he said there was hope.

“If Trump wins, all the establishment Republicans, they’re gone,” Johnson said, according to the Guardian. “They hate him! So who’s left? If we can lobby, we can put our people in there.”

Johnson chairs the American National Super PAC, which has bankrolled radio ads and robocalls in support of Trump, and he briefly served as a California delegate for the campaign until the media asked Trump staffers about his status. (The campaign attributed his inclusion as a delegate to a “database error.”)

The real estate mogul’s poll numbers sank this weekend and the Republican Party was thrown into crisis after a video leaked in which Trump bragged about sexually assaulting women.

Given the state of the race, the alt-right’s fantasy cabinet remains a rather distant dream."
100509,1004,LePage Says 'We Need A Donald Trump To Show Some Authoritarian Power',http://talkingpointsmemo.com/livewire/lepage-trump-authoritarian-obama-autocrat,19,"Maine Gov. Paul LePage (R) praised Donald Trump as a leader who would ""show some authoritarian power"" on Tuesday, even as he slammed President Barack Obama as an ""autocrat.""

""We need a Donald Trump to show some authoritarian power in our country and bring back the rule of law,"" LePage said in an interview with Maine radio station WVOM.

He went on to compare Trump to Obama, decrying the President as ""an autocrat"" who ignores Congress and ""just does it on his own.""

As Maine's Sun Journal newspaper noted, the dictionary defines ""autocrat"" as a person who behaves in an authoritarian manner.

LePage was seemingly unconcerned by Trump’s comments about forcing himself on women in a 2005 video that resurfaced last week, but conceded that Trump is not the ""ideal guy I'd want my daughter going after.”

Lauren LePage, the Maine governor’s daughter, was hired in August by the Trump campaign as state coalitions director."
100510,1004,Member Of Trump’s Evangelical Council Calls Him ‘Lecherous And Worthless’,http://talkingpointsmemo.com/livewire/james-macdonald-trump-evangelical-council-lecherous-worthless-access-hollywood-tape,19,"A megachurch pastor who sits on Donald Trump’s evangelical council denounced the Republican presidential candidate as “lecherous and worthless” over a leaked 2005 video in which Trump boasted about grabbing women.

“Mr. Trump’s comments released yesterday—though 10 years ago (he was 60)—are not just sophomoric or locker room banter,” James MacDonald of Harvest Bible Chapel, an Illinois-based evangelical church, wrote in an email Saturday to his fellow members of Trump’s faith council and some opponents of the GOP candidate. “They are truly the kind of misogynistic trash that reveals a man to be lecherous and worthless—not the guy who gets politely ignored, but the guy who gets a punch in the head from worthy men who hear him talk that way about women.”

The email was first flagged by The Washington Post and published on a blog by Ed Stetzer, a professor of evangelism at Wheaton College.

Despite this caustic language, MacDonald did not abandon support for Trump outright. Instead, he said he’s putting the campaign “on notice” pending the release of another damning tape and will no longer speak out on Trump’s behalf without a “change of heart and direction.”

“If Mr. Trump isn’t seeking our counsel now—1) to be repentant 2) on how to portray that repentance, then the idea of a faith council (which has deteriorated into influence brokering anyway) is really kind of a joke right?” MacDonald wrote.


Trump has done little to seek repentance for the tape published Friday by the Washington Post, in which he describes being able to get away with doing “anything” to women without their consent because of his celebrity status. He and his surrogates have dismissed the conversation as “locker room talk” and pivoted to describing Bill Clinton’s sexual indiscretions.

The tape has fractured the congressional GOP and Trump’s evangelical supporters. Prominent evangelicals including Pat Robertson and Jerry Falwell Jr. are standing by him, but the Post reported that the editorial board of Christianity Today and theologian Wayne Grudem have condemned Trump’s comments."

On Monday, conspiracy radio host Alex Jones made a major announcement: White House sources had informed him that Hillary Clinton and President Barack Obama are ""abject, psychopathic"" demons ""from Hell.""

Jones has hosted Donald Trump on his radio show, InfoWars, and quickly emerged as one of the Republican nominee's leading boosters in conservative media. So at a rally Tuesday in Greensboro, North Carolina, Obama decided to respond. ""I was reading the other day, there's a guy on the radio who apparently, Trump's on his show frequently, he said me and Hillary are demons. Said we smell like sulfur. Ain't that something!""

Obama then paused to smell his own hand.

""Now, I mean, come on, people!"" he said.


Trump only appeared on Jones' show once, but both men have close relationships with conservative dirty trickster Roger Stone, a Nixon campaign vet who serves as an informal Trump adviser and a frequent InfoWars guest.

Jones, in case you're unfamiiar with him, is a 9/11 Truther who claims the Sandy Hook massacre never happened. He has been critical of past Republican candidates, but he can't get enough of The Donald. Jones also helped to popularize the ""Hillary for Prison"" t-shirts that are now ubiquitous at conservative rallies, and his show is an incubator for some of Trump's wildest accusations—including the claim that the November election will be ""rigged.""

""It is surreal,"" Jones commented on his program in August, ""to talk about issues here on air, and then word-for-word hear Trump say it two days later.""

But maybe Jones had a point. If Obama's not the devil, how does the president explain this?"
100512,1005,"Trump's Campaign Enlists Commentator He Once Slammed as a Bigot and Hitler ""Fan""",http://www.motherjones.com/politics/2016/10/donald-trump-pat-buchanan-hitler,19,"Crash-and-burn politics truly make for strange bedfellows. On Tuesday afternoon, as Donald Trump's campaign was in full civil war with the GOP establishment—which had begun to abandon him after the emergence of a 2005 video showing him bragging about committing sexual assault—the Trump campaign sent out a press release highlighting a column that praised Trump and his turn to nothing-but-scorched-earth tactics. The column hailed the besieged GOP nominee for aiming his fire at Republican elites: ""If he is going down to defeat, he will go out as Trump, not some sniveling penitent begging forgiveness from hypocrites who fear and loathe him."" But it also defiantly declared, ""The Donald Lives.""

The point of the press release was to show recipients that Trump was still in the fight and receiving support. But there was a twist the campaign did not acknowledge: Trump once fiercely attacked the author of the column, conservative pundit and onetime GOP presidential candidate Pat Buchanan, as a bigot and a ""fan"" of Hitler.

In 1999, Trump was pondering a run for president as a Reform Party candidate. So was Buchanan, who had mounted a feisty but unsuccessful populist (from the right) campaign in 1996 for the GOP nomination. That year, Buchanan published a book on World War II that contended that Hitler had not posed a direct threat to the West and that the war had not been necessary. Trump leaped to criticize his potential rival. At a visit to a museum run by the Simon Wiesenthal Center, an organization that promotes human rights and studies the Holocaust, he denounced Buchanan, saying, ""We must recognize bigotry and prejudice and defeat it wherever it appears."" He noted, ""I think Pat Buchanan should come here, absolutely. His views are so far off, and what he wrote in his book was so bad.""

In early 2000, while still considering a White House bid, Trump published a book called The America We Deserve, and in the work he lit into Buchanan:

His startling view that the Western allies should not have stopped Hitler is repugnant. When he said that, he totally lost it…To say that Hitler had no ""malignant intentions"" toward the United States is beyond belief. (Twenty years ago, Buchanan was less cautious. He called Hitler ""an individual of great courage, a soldier's soldier…a leader steeped in the history of Europe,"" and talked about his extraordinary gifts.)…Buchanan denigrates the memory of those Americans who, in the Second World War, gave their lives in the effort to stop Hitler.

In another passage, Trump asserted that Buchanan had praised Hitler and called Buchanan ""a fan"" of the Nazi leader. He added:

[Buchanan] has a long history of defending Nazi war criminals and actually argued that the death camps at Treblinka couldn't have executed anyone because the poison gas used was not toxic enough to kill. Buchanan's theory seems to be that Jews took over American foreign policy after the war and lied to us about everything, that Jewish global interests were paramount in American governmental thinking, and they even outweighed United States security interests.

Trump pointed out that conservative icon William F. Buckley had concluded that it was ""impossible to defend Pat Buchanan against the charge that what he did and said…amounted to anti-Semitism.""

Trump expanded his critique of Buchanan beyond Hitler, Jews, and World War II. He wrote, ""I always enjoyed watching Pat Buchanan on TV…I knew his political position was far to the right, but until he published his public embrace of Adolph Hitler, I didn't realize how dangerous his view are on a broad range of subjects."" He observed that Buchanan ""has been guilty of many egregious examples of intolerance. He has systematically bashed Blacks, Mexicans, and Gays. In 1983, saying that homosexuals had 'declared war on nature,' he said that AIDS is nature's awful retribution."" Trump  assailed Buchanan for once saying that women did not possess the ""single-minded ambition and the will to succeed in the fiercely competitive world of Western capitalism."" He criticized Buchanan for supporting apartheid in South Africa.

Some of Trump's criticisms now seem similar to the charges he has faced during the current presidential campaign. And he didn't hold back when decrying Buchanan, declaring that ""Buchanan is close to the lunatic fringe"" and that his ""extremist views have to be challenged by someone."" Trump added, ""Simply put, Pat Buchanan has written too many inflammatory, outrageous, and controversial things to ever be elected president.""

This was a mighty attack: Buchanan, according to Trump, was a Hitler-loving, anti-Semitic, homophobic, misogynistic, racist right-wing extremist.

That was then—and Buchanan hasn't held a grudge. In the past year, he has been a passionate cheerleader for Trump, insisting (proudly) that Trump stole his playbook and proclaiming him the future of the GOP. And now the Trump campaign is citing Buchanan as a Trump supporter and defender. The Hitler ""fan"" and bigot of 16 years ago has become a Trump fan—and that's all Trump's crew needs to know to embrace him."
100513,1005,Donald Trump Takes to Twitter to Stoke a GOP Civil War,http://www.motherjones.com/politics/2016/10/donald-trump-twitter-stoking-republican-civil-war,19,"

Evan Vucci/AP, File
You probably couldn't tell from the way Donald Trump bulldozes through political norms like a child stomping on a sand castle, but apparently the Republican nominee has not been free to be himself. Until now.

On Tuesday, Trump proclaimed himself free of ""shackles"" that had been holding him back and proceeded to lash out at House Speaker Paul Ryan and the Republican establishmentarians who have been distancing themselves from his campaign. On Monday, Ryan had held a conference call with his caucus and told him he would no longer defend Trump after a 2005 video of the GOP nominee bragging about groping women was released last week. (Ryan, however, has not rescinded his endorsement of Trump.) Meanwhile, Republican National Committee Chairman Reince Priebus on Monday declared that the party is still wholly behind Trump.

But Trump's tweetstorm Tuesday is throwing cold water on the unity message the RNC is trying to convey by turning on Ryan and stoking intraparty unrest. Fifteen minutes later, Trump tweeted again, attacking his party. Thirty minutes later, he still wasn't done. If Trump loses in November, he seems bent on bringing the Republican Party crashing down with him. "
100514,1006,"Trump fan to Mike Pence: If Hillary gets in, I’m ready for a revolution",http://hotair.com/archives/2016/10/11/trump-fan-mike-pence-hillary-gets-im-ready-revolution/,19,"A noteworthy exchange under any circumstances but especially today, hours after James O’Keefe’s bombshell about voter fraud in New York City dropped. That’s the voter’s concern here — not just a Trump loss next month but a loss due to Democratic cheating. Trump was always going to blame defeat on foul play, no matter how absurd the margins may be on Election Day, but the O’Keefe video gives that theory new credence. You’ve got a Democratic elections official in the country’s biggest city acknowledging matter-of-factly that cheating goes on to some degree. “What more do you need to know?” Trump will say. It’s so inevitable, in fact, that I wonder if Dems will use the inevitability of it to whip turnout on their own side in the final weeks of the election. If the race is close, they’ll tell their voters, Republicans will scream that the vote was rigged. Only a landslide of unriggable margins will force the right to acknowledge the legitimacy of Clinton’s win. And it’s true, the bigger Hillary’s victory is, the fewer people will buy into the “cheating” explanation. But for some, there’s no margin big enough to disprove the theory. On the contrary, if Clinton piles up a massive landslide, the sheer size of it will be cited as proof of its implausibility. “You mean to tell me that a garbage candidate like Hillary Clinton beat Trump by a bigger margin than Obama beat Romney? Ridiculous!”

Note how quick Pence is to dismiss the “revolution” talk, though. He even tries to reassure the voter that elections can’t be rigged nationally because each individual state oversees its own process. It’s creditable that he’s trying to talk Trump’s base out of radicalism — and it’s also a portent of things to come. If Trump loses and ends up going all in on the “cheating” excuse, mainstream Republicans will come under tremendous pressure from the media to push back for the sake of firming up “faith in the democratic process,” a.k.a. Clinton’s legitimacy. They’ll be under institutional pressures too. The more the GOP cries foul on a Hillary win, especially if she wins going away, the more Democrats will feel free to reciprocate the next time Republicans win. (Democrats are old pros at screeching about cheating, in fact, after 2000 and 2004.) In particular, Republican officials who are close to Trump and therefore carry more weight with his base will be pressed to use their leverage to make the case to those people that Trump lost fair and square. And there’s no GOP official closer to him than his own VP. Whether he likes it or not, Pence is going to end up being asked to be the point man for anti-cheating arguments on the right. If he declines, the media will tear him to pieces for it in 2020 if he runs for president. I’d expect Kellyanne Conway, the most conspicuously mainstream member of Trump’s inner circle (and a pollster by trade), to come under heavy pressure too to acknowledge Clinton’s win, if only in the interest of stamping out “revolution” talk like this. That’ll be an interesting subplot to the feeding frenzy of recriminations within the GOP if/when Trump goes on to lose. Which Republicans are trying to gingerly shore up faith in the election’s outcome and which are trying to tear it down?

By the way, a new Reuters poll out this afternoon has Clinton leading nationally by eight points, up three in a week and in line with the 7-9-point range that NBC saw in its polling over the weekend. More interestingly, fully 53 percent thought Hillary won the debate versus 32 percent who thought Trump did. That’s similar to CNN’s post-debate poll, which had it 57/34. Those are surprisingly lopsided margins for an event at which Trump performed better than he did at the first debate while Clinton was mediocre and unmemorable. A Twitter pal had the same thought I did after seeing the CNN numbers yesterday: Maybe some critical mass of the public has now written Trump off to the point where they’re not willing to credit him with anything, including a decent debate performance. If asked “Trump or X?”, they may be reflexively answering “X” no matter what “X” is. Who won the debate? Why, X did. Not a good sign for Election Day, needless to say."
100515,1006,Maine Gov. Paul LePage: The Constitution is broken and we need some “authoritarian power” from Trump to set things right,http://hotair.com/archives/2016/10/11/maine-gov-paul-lepage-constitution-broken-need-authoritarian-power-trump-set-things-right/,19,"Paul LePage, February 2016: “I’m a big constitutionalist.” That was around the time he reportedly told a meeting of Republican governors, following Trump’s big primary win in New Hampshire, that they should draft an open letter to “the people” disavowing Trump and condemning his divisiveness.

Fast-forward eight months. Paul LePage, October 2016:

“Sometimes, I wonder that our Constitution is not only broken, but we need a Donald Trump to show some authoritarian power in our country and bring back the rule of law because we’ve had eight years of a president, he’s an autocrat, he just does it on his own, he ignores Congress and every single day, we’re slipping into anarchy,” LePage said on Maine radio station WVOM…

“And you know, the bottom line. The bottom line is this,” LePage said of Trump. “Is he a slimeball? I’d be the first one to say, not a guy ideally I’d want my daughter going after. But I will tell you one thing, as the head of state, is he going to protect our nation and fight the debt or is he going to go after interns? That’s the bottom line.”
Skip to 10:15 of the clip for the key bit. He’s being true to the spirit of Trumpism here, and not just in the obvious national-savior caesarist sense. Trump is where he is partly because he’s been willing to jettison all pretense of principle and encourage Republican voters to get what’s rightfully theirs, even — or especially — if it requires emulating the left to do so. Chumps like Paul Ryan will tell you that the entitlement system is unsustainable and desperately needs reform; Trump vows to protect entitlements come what may because you paid into the system and you deserve your cut. Ryan types will tell you that it’s shameful to donate to Democrats or to stiff creditors by liberally using the bankruptcy laws; Trump will tell you that both of those things are simply what a good businessman does to maximize his own profits. Conservatives dislike racial identity politics; Trumpers support white identity politics because it evens the political playing field with other racial voting blocs. LePage’s comments add another chapter to all of that. Obama has weakened separation of powers by expanding executive authority over immigration, health care, and foreign interventions. The solution to that isn’t stricter fidelity to the Constitution and shifting power from the executive to the legislature. The solution is brute force “authoritarian power” for Trump to shift government the other way, to the right. Obama was an autocrat? Well, now we get an autocrat too."

In the email, Clinton attorney Marc Elias outlined what is basically a strategy for steering large campaign donors to the super PAC without breaking the law.

Elias told Clinton campaign officials it would be OK to tell staff at the super PAC: “Donor A works in financial services and has been a long-time contributor. I think she’d be willing to do six figures for Priorities.”

But not recommended, writes Elias, would be for the Clinton campaign official to say to a super PAC official: “I want you to call Donor A and ask for $250,000.”
What’s the difference between the two? Not much, but arguably enough to keep the FEC at bay. One is a suggestion, the other is direction — even if both of them have exactly the same intent and impact. The memo makes this even more plain on fundraising:

“From time to time, Priorities might request [Hillary for America] to speak to prospective donors about Priorities – either before or after Priorities’ contact with the donor,” the attorneys from the D.C. law firm Perkins Coie tell the Clinton aides in the Elias memo.

“When HFA staff or consultants speak to these prospective donors about Priorities, they must include a hard money ask (for $5,000 or less) during the course of the conversation. We have provided you with scripts and talking points for such conversations.”
Even then, though, this seems to skirt pretty close to the edge. Can campaigns share donor info with super-PACs without crossing the line on coordination? Elias might know that better than anyone, but if so, then the bar on “coordination” sounds a lot more impressive than it actually is in reality.

That’s not terribly surprising, either. Supposedly, super-PACS operate independently of political campaigns, but no one really believes that. All during the opening days of primary season in early 2015, candidates would enter the race along with their companion super-PAC, staffed by some trusted longterm aide or friend who would know exactly what the candidate wanted … by osmosis, natch. Everyone trades accusations of coordination, but campaigns are adept enough to keep up appearances well enough to fend off actual complaints.

This demonstrates just how hypocritical “campaign finance reform” demands have been, especially Hillary Clinton’s years-long tirade against the Citizens United decision. Hillary doesn’t want “big money out of politics” — she wants it controlled and shielded from public view so she can exploit it for herself. The proper reform for campaign finance is to eliminate tax deductions for PACs and super-PACs, end contribution limits, and incentivize the money to flow to the candidates directly and make the entire transaction record transparent. That makes the candidates and their parties directly responsible for messaging, while allowing everyone else to keep their First Amendment right to free speech without government interference.

In the end, as these e-mails show, the result is the same — the candidates are controlling the operations anyway. This Byzantine system just allows them a fig leaf of deniability that insults the intelligence of voters."

You would think that these revelations would be devastating to her White House chances.

But we all know that the media has no interest in focusing on her as much as Donald Trump.

You know how Democrats always try to pretend voter fraud isn’t a problem even though it clearly is?

Check out this latest WikiLeaks email that shows John Podesta talking about it.

From Federalist Papers: In an email, John Podesta discussed his meeting to two Coloradans who made it clear that they wanted help in making sure that only legal and living people were allowed to vote in the 2015 caucuses.

These two individuals just happen to be tight with the Clinton campaign, and are concerned that there might be some improper conduct going on surrounding the caucus, and as we all know, if it’s not the Clintons who are cheating, nobody can cheat! As this message describes, these two people discussed a strong likelihood that massive voter fraud was taking place in Colorado. So why is it when Republicans mention voter fraud they’re laughed out of the room, but when Democrats talk about it among themselves, there’s never any refutation that it exists? Interesting…

Looks like President Obama has some questions to answer about the election in 2008.

This makes it sound like Podesta acknowledges that voter fraud exists no?

Of course it’s real.

There have been hundreds of documented cases and those are just the people who get caught.

Check out this bombshell we learned for James O’Keefe today.

Still think it’s not real?"

She was on the campus of Ohio State University today.

Looks like she is still terrible at campaigning and it also looks like she had a few unwanted visitors.

It didn’t go well. From The Federalist Papers:

With all of this talk about the Donald Trump video that was released, it would have been best if Hillary Clinton had just stayed out of it. You know, since her husband was (is?) a serial philanderer with several non-consensual sexual encounters under his belt (READ: rape). But of course, she felt the need to chime in, which angered a lot of people who realize that she is throwing rather large stones from a rather delicate glass house. This was made clear at an Ohio State University rally, when a group of protesters showed up just to remind her of her husband’s past (and illegal) indiscretions.

Protesters at the OSU rally gathered and carried “Bill Clinton is a Rapist” signs, wore “Hillary For Prison” shirts and waved a flag saying “Come And Take It.”

They began a rousing chant of “Bill Clinton Is A Rapist,” which you can see below. Wow.

Hillary can try all she wants but she can’t escape the reality she is married to a really bad guy.

Looks like people aren’t listening to the media’s ridiculous claim that Bill’s past is off limits.

O! H!"
100519,1007,"Billy Bush Bragged About Trump Tape During Rio Olympics, Contradicting NBC’s Story They Found It Last Week",http://www.youngcons.com/billy-bush-bragged-about-trump-tape-during-rio-olympics-contradicting-nbcs-story-they-found-it-last-week/,19,"We all know by now about the leaked tape that showed Donald Trump saying rude things 11 years ago.

The media is pretending it’s horrifying.  But it’s really not…

Obviously the timing of this release is a little suspect.  NBC has been claiming they just found the tape.

Here’s more from the great Stephen Miller on their explanation.

From Heat Street:

Indeed, NBC’s behavior surrounding the tape is highly suspicious and raises several questions: Stelter reports that NBC found the tape on Monday, and were still debating how to report on its existence when it was leaked to the Washington Post on Friday. What really was taking NBC so long? It only took the Post a few hours to publish the material.
Was NBC sitting on the audio because it was worried about the damage it would do to Billy Bush?
Why did someone within NBC feel compelled to leak the audio to theWashington Post? Was it because NBC never actually intended to release the audio until after the election? That doesn’t exactly jive with what we are learning now.

It looks like Billy Bush was running around the Olympics at Rio telling all his coworkers about the tape.

 From Fox News:

Billy Bush allegedly boasted about the now-infamous Donald Trump hot mic tape to NBC staffers as far back as August. But it still took nearly two months – and a leak to the Washington Post – for the politically damaging footage to see the light of day. So did the network sit on it?

The now-suspended “Today” show host told colleagues during the Olympics in Rio that there was a “tape of [Republican presidential nominee] Trump being a real dog,” The New York Post reported on Monday. Staffers at “Access Hollywood,” the show Bush co-hosted in 2005 when the crude tape was recorded, reportedly began trying to track down the recording after Bush’s brag. Bush did not tell NBC News executives about the tape, The New York Post reported.

“If he knew about the tape, and remembered the full extent of such explosive conversation with a presidential candidate and didn’t disclose that to NBC News, that is a very, very serious problem,” a source told The New York Post.

So we are expected to believe that NBC hasn’t known about this tape for years?

Billy Bush was telling people at NBC about it months ago.

Common sense also dictates that someone was aware of the tape when it was actually recorded 11 years ago and they wouldn’t just forget about something so explosive.

Every rational thinker on the planet clearly understands that NBC has been waiting for the perfect time to drop this bomb.

It is also very likely, knowing what we know about the deep ties between Hillary and the mainstream media, that the Hillary campaign was looped in at some point.

Such a joke.

If Donald Trump was such a monster and he was condoning sexual assault on this tape (which he wasn’t) then how in the world can NBC justify holding onto a tape that would expose his evil actions and subsequently protect innocent women in the future?

NBC should be ashamed in more ways than one."
100520,1008,The Political ‘Education Divide’ and Me,http://www.americanthinker.com/articles/2016/10/the_political_education_divide_and_me.html,19,"All of a sudden the experts are bellowing that the educated are voting for Clinton and the uneducated are voting for Trump. Here’s Tim Alberta in National Review, and here is David Runciman in The Guardian to tell you all about it. Call it the “education divide.”

But where does that leave me? You see, I think of myself as educated, but I am going to vote for Trump. So what’s my problem?

Of course, my terminal degree is a bachelor’s in Civil Engineering from England, with no courses in the liberal arts. I didn’t really get an education until I started reading as an adult. That makes me an autodidact, and you know what they are like. The only time I’ve been in a university since the 1960s is to take one class each in Aristotle, Plato, Kant, and Hume. And I took those classes so that I would know the official liberal line on those ancients.

Actually, it makes complete sense that the educated would be voting liberal. That is the whole point of the ruling class’s program of cradle to Ph.D. education. The idea is to form the minds of the little darlings, as husbands liked to form the minds of their wives and daughters in Austen and Trollope novels.

Back in the old days, universities were seminaries founded by churches for the training of ministers who would then go out and preach orthodoxy to the unwashed. Today the universities are secular seminaries for the training of activists that can then go out and practice peaceful protest on the victims. So nothing has changed.

Any real educated liberal would admit, of course, that education is fascism. Education comes from the Latin ducare, to lead. From thence is the noun Dux, leader, the English Duke, and the Italian, Il Duce. And you know what that means: education is fascism, straight up. Now you know why so many artistical liberals like to wear black shirts.

But I think I understand why I, a self-educated white man born in India and raised in England, don’t go with the educated herd on politics. As they sang in South Pacific,

You’ve got to be taught
To hate and to fear

the bitter clingers and the deplorables. It takes a lot of time and a lot of money -- ""From year to year… In your dear little ear"" -- as Lt. Cable sang, to develop the proper amount of hate and fear for the racists, sexists, and bigots of the world, and I never got the full treatment.

When a lefty prof. told me I’d taken a university place from a deserving working-class kid, I told myself he could take it where the sun don’t shine. Well, I would have done, except I didn’t yet know how to talk like an American movie gangster. That was part of my adult education.

But there is nothing remarkable about all this hating and fearing. Samuel P. Huntington in The Clash of Civilizations puts it quite prosaically.

People use politics not just to advance their interests but also to define their identity. We know who we are only when we know who we are not and often only when we know who we are against.

That is what all the yelling and screaming is about. That is what racists, sexists, homophobes are about. That is what SJWs shutting down offensive speech is about.

Back in the original eruption of the left, what I call the Class of 1848, the left defined its identity by championing the cause of the workers in the industrial revolution. And they defined themselves against the bourgeoisie who they appointed into the vacant exploiter/oppressor role formerly occupied by the aristocracy.

But the bourgeoisie was perfectly happy to redress the grievances of the workers -- what softies! -- so the Class of 1848 needed new evildoers against which to define itself.

Today the left defines itself as “the educated,” which seems to include the men that used to be called the Robber Barons -- your Tom Steyers, your Bill Gateses, your Sergey Brins, even your Jeff Bezoses, and certainly your Carlos Slims, but not your evil Koch Brothers -- and it defines itself against the uneducated. That is why Hillary Clinton defines herself against the deplorables and the irredeemables.

Obviously, if you align yourself with the left you get a get-out-of-jail-free card to call yourself “educated.” You go to your secular seminary, you get a thorough training in activism and victimism, and then you get sent forth into the world to proselytize your faith in big government and victimism in a meaningful life of activism and peaceful protest.

Somehow, I just can’t get with the program, whatever the mean girls say. Maybe it’s because I’m interested in ideas, not what people think of me. There must be something wrong with me.

100521,1008,The Coming National Gun Ban – and How the States Can Resist,http://www.americanthinker.com/articles/2016/10/the_coming_national_gun_ban__and_how_the_states_can_resist.html,19,"The law of averages predicts that at some time in the future, perhaps as soon as 2017, the Democratic Party will once again control the White House and majorities in both houses of Congress. When that happens, the next Democratic president -- be it Hillary Clinton or someone else -- will sign into law a sweeping, foreign-style gun ban.

The legislation has already been written. H.R. 4269 would enact a national, permanent ban on the manufacture and sale of so-called “assault weapons” and all firearm magazines capable of holding more than 10 rounds. The bill, introduced last December, already has149 Democratic co-sponsors (218 are needed to pass the House).

H.R. 4269 would ban all AR-15 and AK-type rifles and all civilian versions of military rifles produced anywhere in the word within the past 60 years or so. The bill would also ban all parts kits, stripped receivers, “bump-fire” stocks, thumbhole stocks, trigger cranks, so-called “compliant” rifles, and “any… characteristic that can function as a [pistol] grip.” Law enforcement is exempt from the bill’s provisions.

H.R. 4269 is not a “kick down the door and confiscate ‘em” bill. Existing rifles and magazines are “grandfathered” (but the transfer of existing magazines is permanently prohibited). Gun banners know that it is literally impossible to perform a door-to-door gun confiscation in a nation of 300 million people, and that any attempt to do so would certainly be met with violence. Consequently, they have pre-empted the “Come and take it” crowd by employing a long-term strategy. Once the manufacture and sale of certain weapons is prohibited, it is only a matter of time before the legislation would be amended to outlaw the transfer of “grandfathered” rifles as well as magazines, thus enacting a de facto confiscation within a generation.

Although banning “assault weapons” is a Democratic proposal and a plank that Hillary Clinton has campaigned upon (she called the National Rifle Association an “enemy” along with Iran) it should not be assumed that all Republicans would oppose it. Republican presidential hopefuls Chris Christie, John Kasich, and Rudy Giuliani have all supported gun control in the past.

The impetus to push such legislation through Congress would likely come from a high-profile shooting or terrorist act that, like the Reichstag fire, would receive extensive media attention and provide the propaganda necessary for gun controllers like Chuck Schumer, the next Democratic Senate Majority Leader, to enact their pre-existing agenda. Republicans might find themselves accused of being “soft on terrorism” if they voted against gun control after such an event. Indeed, President Obama’s Secretary of Homeland Security, Jeh Johnson, has already stated publicly that domestic gun control is necessary as an anti-terrorism measure.

But banning “assault weapons” has nothing to do with combatting terrorism, or, for that matter, garden-variety street crime. It is a well-established fact that “assault weapons” (and long guns in general) are used in only the tiniest fraction of crimes. Handguns are used in nearly all street crimes committed with firearms. Furthermore, it’s entirely possible for a homicidal maniac to commit a mass shooting with a “sporting” arm. In Great Britain, a deranged individual killed 12 people with a licensed, registered bolt-action rimfire rifle -- after semi-automatics and handguns were banned and confiscated in that nation. And in Norway, where “assault weapons” had also been banned, Anders Breivik murdered 77 people, most of them with a Ruger Mini-14 sporting rifle. Both of the rifles used in those crimes are specifically exempted from H.R. 4269.

If banning “assault weapons” has nothing to do with crime or terrorism, why are the Democrats so eagerly in favor of it? The answer is that they have a Hobbesian worldview, in which an all-powerful “Leviathan” government has a complete monopoly on the exercise of power. The Founders recognized that military-quality arms, not sporting arms, are an indispensable tool for challenging government oppression. Contemporary Democrats, who reject the Founders’ teaching, believe that such arms must be banned precisely because they can be used to challenge Leviathan’s authority.

If H.R. 4269 or a similar bill becomes law, do not expect the Supreme Court to come to the rescue and strike it down. If there is a Democratic president and Democratic Senate next year, the vacancy on the Supreme Court created by the death of pro-Second Amendment justice Antonin Scalia will certainly be filled by a liberal, anti-gun justice. And there is a significant likelihood that aging justices Ginsberg, Kennedy, and Breyer could also be replaced by the next president. Their seats would undoubtedly also be filled by anti-gun, left-wing jurists.

If the Supreme Court upholds a national “assault weapons” ban, what recourse do the people have? In deep-blue “liberal” states like New York, California, Massachusetts and Connecticut, the answer is “None.” These states have already enacted legislation nearly identical to H.R. 4269, with very little opposition and widespread public support.

But conservative, pro-gun “red” states might have one final ace in the hole.

Liberal gun-banners have long held the position that the Second Amendment only protects the right of state militias to bear arms, and that such a right does not extend to the general public not enrolled in the militia. Justice Scalia destroyed that argument with a close textual analysis of the Second Amendment in the landmark gun-rights case District of Columbia v. Heller. But in a virulent dissent, Justice John Paul Stevens reiterated the liberal “only militias can have guns” interpretation.

Should Stevens’s dissent become the majority opinion in a future case, conservative, pro-gun state legislatures could turn the “militias only” argument against the gun-banners by passing legislation expanding the membership of their state militias to all adult residents of the state, and specifically empowering all adults to purchase military-style semi-automatic rifles and magazines capable of holding more than ten rounds.

Were such a scenario to occur, the Federal government might try to suppress the arming of the newly-redefined state militias by banning arms and ammunition sales to them through the Interstate Commerce Clause. Such action would precipitate a constitutional crisis between the states and the Federal government.

Of course, the possibility that the Federal government would cause a national crisis by suppressing the right of the people to keep and bear arms is the very reason why the Founders wrote the Second Amendment in the first place. Will there be a sequel to the “shot heard ‘round the world” on April 19, 1775?

We might be about to find out.

100522,1008,Trump and the Surrender Caucus of the GOP,http://www.americanthinker.com/articles/2016/10/trump_and_the_surrender_caucus_of_the_gop.html,19,"Right now we are witnessing one of the reasons the Left is winning and the Right losing America.

No Democratic Party president or presidential candidate in history has ever been subjected to, or will be subjected to, the kind of savage attempted assassination by his own party’s leaders that Donald Trump is now enduring from the great and the good among Republicans and “respectable” conservatives.

All for a locker room crudity that he thought he spoke in private.

Without the active, enthusiastic support of Republican office holders, present and former, this distraction from the real issues would have dried up and blown away in two days. But the ugly truth is Trump’s own party’s leaders are leading the pack of baying hounds.

Contrast this with the Left’s reaction to indiscretions by its presidents or presidential candidates: No matter the infraction, the moral failing or the actual crime, the Left stands by its main man. Always.

Of course, the band of Never Trumps now trying to destroy their voters’ choice for the presidency were already looking for an excuse to commit this coup against the party base well before the current opportunity arose.

But the reality is that in similar circumstances the feckless Republican Party, along with much of the “respectable” American Right, would be administering the same slashing to a candidate they liked.

Richard Nixon was not destroyed by the Democrats and the Left.  They were merely his tormentors, in Congress and the press.  Nixon’s presidency was ended by the prissy elders of his own party. The committee of Republican senators sent to deliver the political death sentence was chaired by none other than conservative icon Barry Goldwater.

If Lyndon Johnson had found himself in similar circumstances (participant in the cover up of a silly burglary of his opponent’s campaign headquarters), his party would have rallied round him and saved his presidency. They would have called it a witch hunt over a minor matter and, even if the Democrats had been a minority in Congress, as the Republicans were when Watergate broke, they would have blocked his impeachment in the Senate.

To the Left the agenda and power are everything. Character, peccadillos, and personal pastimes are nothing.

This is the cold-blooded attitude that makes for political victories in universal suffrage democracies.

Bill Clinton brings to mind another example of the Left’s unfailing loyalty to its leaders. Bill’s lifelong hobby of rape, molestation and harassment of women was open and notorious … and of absolutely no concern to the Democratic Party or organized feminists, though it violated every precious precept of the Party’s alleged fealty to the cause of the female sex, along with some of the most salient complaints of organized feminism. Through it all, the Left’s swords were wielded in faithful and successful defense of their leader.

You’ve got to give them credit: The Democratic Party, now the American Left, plays for keeps, and they never, ever, ever … take their eye off the ball.

And, as everyone seriously involved in politics knows, the ball is: the Agenda and the Power to enact it.

Republicans and conservatives, on the other hand, are represented by leaders whose primary concern is to be well regarded by ladies who lunch at the club.

And so, because Trump, believing his conversation private, made a crude comment -- the likes of which most men have heard several times in their lives and which pales into risible insignificance alongside Bill Clinton’s sexual hobbies, or his and his wife’s rapid accumulation of great wealth through some of the most poorly concealed acceptance of bribes in the history of influence peddling -- Republicans and conservatives are told to abandon their candidate.

Not this writer.

And, it is to be hoped, not the overwhelming majority of Trump’s supporters and those who should be supporting him.

Keep your eye on the ball: The Agenda and the Power to enact it.  When you take your eye off that, you will lose to those who never do. Religious people, evangelicals, Mormons, middle and upper middle class suburban women, all take note. Yours will be the greatest losses if the Left returns to power for eight more years.

What needed to happen was simply this: Trump issuing an apology -- just this once -- for his locker room vulgarism. This he did in his Sunday evening debate.  It was classic Trump, short and to the point, but adequate to the puniness of the matter at hand.  

And now the Republican Party, including and especially its major office holders, conservative commentators, and the Trump Campaign, need to say something along the following lines every time this matter, or God knows what other distraction, is brought up:

“We understand why you don’t want to talk about the issues of greatest concern to the American people, including and especially to American women; we understand why you’re trying not to talk about the atrocious economy and scarcity of good paying jobs, the open borders that you’ve created and the mass invasion of America by illegals it’s caused; we understand why you don’t want to talk about the general amnesty for illegals you’re planning; we understand why you want to avoid discussing the violence, danger and insecurity you’ve created in America by your vicious  attacks on America’s police and by your refusal to forcibly identify and confront radical Islam; we understand why you don’t want to talk about the truly awful Obamacare, that’s being paid for by enormous increases in health care premiums imposed on America’s working and middle classes.

“You don’t want to talk about any of these issues because a very large majority of Americans detest what you’ve been doing on all of them. And because Hillary Clinton is promising eight more years of all these disasters.”

“But no matter what distractions you bring up, we are going to talk about all these issues of intense concern to the American people, and only these, from now till Election Day.”

This would all work out well in a rational political world.

But the Republican Party today is led by men and women who would rather lose the presidency and subject America to the Left’s agenda, perhaps permanently, so they can maintain their control of the Party -- or, in the case of conservative commentators, so they can maintain their control of the politically ineffective “conservative movement.”

Trump’s handling of the matter will be decreed insufficient by the Ladies lunch moralists of the Republican Party leadership and by the equally testosterone deficient conservative intellectuals among the NeverTrumps.

But if this distraction, or any other, derails the candidacy of Republicans and conservatives’ choice for the presidency, it will be solely because Republican Party leaders and the NeverTrump turncoats led the mob or joined it.

Just as Nixon could not have been brought down if the Party he served so long and so well had stood by him, no locker room vulgarism, spoken in reasonable expectation of privacy, could destroy Trump.  Unless its prosecution had the enthusiastic complicity of Republican and conservative leaders, to whom personal position is more important than the conservative agenda and the power of the presidency to pursue it.

If the Left again gains the presidency, as I’ve argued before, it will be a terminal defeat for conservatism. Demographic changes that will be intensified and fanatically promoted by the Left for the next eight years will effectively establish a one party state in the governing branches of the federal government: The presidency and the activist federal judiciary. 

In the short term the Republican Party will dissolve. An American political party can survive many things, including a great defeat. But it cannot survive its leadership’s deliberate destruction of a presidential candidate chosen by its own voters.

We continue to support Trump with great enthusiasm, and with great admiration for his courage and fighting spirit.  We urge him, for the duration of the campaign, to focus exclusively on the issues that brought him this far in his, and our, struggle to preserve and restore America.

100523,1009,DID THE CLINTON CAMPAIGN COORDINATE WITH DOJ ON HILLARY’S EMAILS?,http://www.powerlineblog.com/archives/2016/10/did-the-clinton-campaign-coordinate-with-doj-on-hillarys-emails.php,19,"That claim is being made in some quarters today, based on the latest batch of Wikileaks emails from the account of John Podesta. The Hill, for example, headlines “Clinton camp appeared to have contacts with DOJ on email case.” Drudge headlines “CAMPAIGN DISCUSSIONS WITH DOJ!” The New York Post cites the Trump campaign’s characterization of the leaked emails: “Emails show Clinton ‘colluded’ with DOJ: Trump campaign.” NBC’s Tom Winter may have gotten the ball rolling by tweeting, “NEW: Hacked e-mails from Wikileaks appear to show Clinton campaign spokesman in touch with DOJ officials regarding e-mail litigation.” Trump himself called Winter’s tweet “unbelievable.”

The issue is raised by a series of emails in May 2015. Although I haven’t seen this noted in the press, the thread begins on the evening of May 18 (8:51 p.m.) with an email from an unidentified person at DOJ to Brian Fallon, formerly with Justice but now working for the Clinton campaign: “This” was a filing by the government in the lawsuit in which plaintiff Vice News was trying to pry loose Hillary Clinton’s State Department emails, which are supposed to be available via a Freedom of Information Act request. Within minutes, Fallon forwarded the email to a number of the usual Hillary suspects–Huma Abedin, Cheryl Mills et al.: To her credit, Cheryl Mills apparently thought DOJ was taking a ridiculously optimistic approach: it was just May, and they didn’t want to produce any emails at all until January 2016. Heh. Sometimes liberals even surprise themselves.

Next there is a series of emails, all on the evening of May 18, in which Ms. Abedin et al talk about scheduling a conference call for early the following morning. After that comes Brian Fallon’s email the next morning, which is one of the ones critics have seized upon: A week later, Fallon added this reminder: So, what does this mean? Is it evidence of illicit cooperation between the Hillary campaign and the Department of Justice?

No. These are extremely routine communications between friendly parties. (Remember that for present purposes, Hillary is not a potential felon under investigation by the FBI, she is a former Secretary of State whose documents are being produced.) The filing of briefs, scheduling of hearings and issuance of court orders are matters of public record. There is nothing wrong with a lawyer at DOJ telling someone–a former colleague, or anyone else–that Justice has filed a brief; that a hearing will take place; and so on. The Clintons have involved themselves in countless scandals over the years, but this isn’t one of them.

Still, it is interesting that DOJ kept in touch with the Clinton campaign on the general subject of the State Department’s production of Hillary’s emails. DOJ took an extreme position, as Cheryl Mills’s reaction reflected, that was rejected by the presiding court.

This doesn’t mean that there aren’t scandals connected with Hillary’s reckless handling of classified information at the State Department. Of course there are. The Wikileaks dump includes this email, from March 5, 2015, a couple of months earlier than the thread reproduced above. Hillary’s aides have concocted a statement on the State Department emails that Hillary has now approved, so it will be released: I want the public to see my email. I asked State to release them. They said they will review them for release as soon as possible.

This is a bad joke. Hillary’s statement was issued the day after the House’s Benghazi committee subpoenaed the emails from her illegal off-the-books server. We now know that a few weeks later, acting belatedly on Cheryl Mills’s instructions, a Platte River employee deleted 33,000 Hillary emails from her illegal server, many of which related to State Department business and some of which were under subpoena. And, as the Fallon emails reflect, the State Department, represented by DOJ, tried to delay release of any of the emails until January 2016, a ridiculous position.

So, bottom line: Hillary’s off-the-books server arrangement was scandalous in several respects, and DOJ’s refusal to indict Mrs. Clinton was the worst aspect of the scandal. But the fact that a DOJ lawyer passed on publicly available information about filings and hearing dates does not add materially to what we already knew."
100524,1009,HOW LEADERS TALK,http://www.powerlineblog.com/archives/2016/10/how-leaders-talk.php,19,"Sally Jenkins writes about sports for the Washington Post. I gather that, like many sportswriters these days, she would rather write about politics. And why not? Her work meets the low standard of punditry at the Post.

Today, Jenkins has a column called (in the print edition) “No leader says things like that in locker room.” Her argument is that although athletes do make lewd, Trump-style comments in the locker room, the athletes who are most respected by their teammates do not. She quotes a football players to that effect.

I hope Jenkins is right, but I’m not persuaded. Mickey Mantle was the leader of the New York Yankees. According to his teammate Jim Bouton, The Mick led his teammates on “beaver shooting” expeditions, including visits to hotel roofs where they engaged in voyeurism.

Maybe the locker room has been radically transformed since Mantle’s day. Or maybe Jenkins found a handful of anti-Trump athletes who would give her the quote she was looking for.

Trump, in any event, is not running for locker room leader. He’s running for the office held for eight years by the spouse of his opponent. What does Bill Clinton talk about in the most analogous setting to the locker room that he frequents — the golf course?

According to Clinton’s close friend Vernon Jordan, they talk about “p***y.” That’s what Jordan told Mike Wallace during an interview on 60 Minutes.

The kind of talk Trump and Clinton indulge in is deplorable. But it should not be considered disqualifying in a president.

The acts Trump said he engaged in — and the acts Clinton has credibly been accused of by several women — are a different matter. The important question is whether Trump has committed the acts of sexual assault he described to Billy Bush.

When pressed during the debate, Trump said he hasn’t. The denial occurred in this exchange with Anderson Cooper:

Cooper: For the record, are you saying that what you said on the bus 11 years ago, that you did not actually kiss women without consent or grope women without consent?

Trump: I have great respect for women. Nobody has more respect for women than I do.

Cooper: So for the record, you’re saying you never did that?

Trump: Frankly, you hear these things. They are said. And I was am embarrassed by it. But I have respect for women–

Cooper: –Have you ever done those things?

Trump: — And they have respect for me. And I will tell you, no I have not. . . .

(Emphasis added)

Is Trump’s denial truthful? I don’t know. But unlike with Bill Clinton, no woman to my knowledge has yet accused Trump of sexual assault. Maybe this will be the next “October surprise.”

In any event, this sad fact is beyond dispute: at least one political leader, the dominant one of his era, talks the way Trump did to Billy Bush."
100525,1009,MICHELLE OBAMA DECLARED HILLARY UNFIT [UPDATED],http://www.powerlineblog.com/archives/2016/10/michelle-obama-declared-hillary-unfit.php,19,"During the town hall presidential candidates’ debate this past Sunday evening in St. Louis (transcript here), Hillary Clinton responded to Donald Trump’s attack on her for her role as Bill Clinton’s enabler. She invoked Michelle Obama’s advice: “When they go low, we go high.” Michelle apparently disagrees with the Mister, who advises: “If they bring a knife to the fight, we bring a gun.”

Trump responded by claiming that Michelle Obama had participated in attack ads saying terrible things about Clinton. “Go back and look at those,” he said.

David Axelrod, the chief campaign strategist of President Obama in campaigns past, quickly disputed Trump on Twitter. Thus Megan Garvey fact-checked Trump for the Los Angeles Times and found him wanting. Fact-checking the fact-checkers, I find Axelrod and the Times wanting.

Trump’s reference was obscure and slightly mistaken, but I knew instantly what he was talking about. During the 2008 primary campaign, speaking before a hometown audience, Michelle Obama explained why Hillary Clinton was unfit to serve as president. Let’s go to the tape. Michelle Obama said: “One of the important aspects of this race is role modeling what good families should look like. And my view is that if you can’t run your own house, you certainly can’t run the White House. Can’t do it.”

Axelrod and the Times to the contrary notwithstanding, on this point Trump had it right in substance.

It makes for an interesting case study. If anyone but Michelle Obama had said what she said, it would have been a major incident in the culture war. Indeed, Michelle Obama would have fallen as a casualty in the culture war. Michelle Obama being Michelle Obama, however, she got away with it.

Mrs. Obama’s critique of Clinton was so utterly hidebound and old-school that she sounded like a conservative of Phyllis Schlafly’s vintage. Expanding on the implicit assertions of Michelle Obama’s earnest observations, Hillary Clinton is not fit to to be president because her family is not fit to serve as a role model. Her husband’s escapades demonstrate that she can’t run her own house. If she can’t run her own house, according to Mrs. Obama, she shouldn’t be president. She’s not fit to serve.

David Axelrod is being David Axelrod and the Times fact checker is simply ignorant. Only students of ancient history have any idea what Michelle Obama had to say about Madam Hillary in 2008."
100526,1010,The Religious Right’s pro-Trump anti-transgender hypocrisy,https://thinkprogress.org/trump-transgender-hypocrisy-cd7d1d82b188#.e90r53lmy,19,"When it comes to letting transgender people simply using the restroom, religious conservatives are quick to warn that any accommodations pose a massive threat to women’s “safety and privacy.” But after newly discovered tapes of the Republican nominee for president bragging about sexually assaulting women were published last week, many of those same conservatives are still standing by their endorsements.
Almost all of the campaigns against transgender equality have been focused on painting transgender women as “male” predators looking to access women’s spaces in order to violate them. The messaging was first used in 2012 to oppose LGBT protections in Anchorage, then again last year to oppose the Houston Equal Rights Ordinance, and it has been the defense of North Carolina’s odious HB2. Women who were survivors of sexual assault were even the face of the failed campaign to overturn transgender protections in Washington state, even though there is zero evidence that respecting trans identities makes bathrooms or locker rooms any less safe.
Donald Trump, on the other hand, is actually a man who has openly bragged about sexually assaulting women and been accused of such assaults on multiple occasions. He also admitted to walking around backstage at one of the beauty pageants he owns while the female contestants were naked and changing. Here’s a look at people who think someone who likes to “grab them by the pussy” is still a vote-worthy candidate for president, paired with statements the same people have made about whether transgender people should be allowed to pee in peace.
Gov. Mike Pence
On transgender protections: “Policies regarding the security and privacy of students in our schools should be in the hands of Hoosier parents and local schools, not bureaucrats in Washington, DC. The federal government has no business getting involved in issues of this nature. I am confident that parents, teachers and administrators will continue to resolve these matters without federal mandates and in a manner that reflects the common sense and compassion of our state.”
On Trump’s 2005 remarks: “It’s absolutely false to suggest that at any point in time we considered dropping off this ticket… He said last night very clearly that that was talk, not actions. And I believe him and I think the contrast between that and what the Clintons were involved in 20 years ago_—_the four women that were present last night_—_was pretty dramatic.”
Ben Carson On transgender protections: “How about we have a transgender bathroom? It is not fair for them to make everybody else uncomfortable. It’s one of the things that I don’t particularly like about the movement. I think everybody has equal rights, but I’m not sure that anybody should have extra rights_—_extra rights when it comes to redefining everything for everybody else and imposing your view on everybody else.”
On Trump’s 2005 remarks: “Those of us who do not want to see America fundamentally devolve into something worse must be wise enough to recognize the scheme that is being played out here. We must demand not only that the issues be discussed but also that we make our decisions based on issues and not on personalities or decade old statements and behavior by Hillary Clinton or Donald Trump.”
Mike Huckabee
On transgender protections: “Now I wish somebody had told me when I was in high school, that I could have felt like a woman when it came time to take showers in P.E. I’m pretty sure I would’ve found my feminine side and said, ‘Coach, I think I’d rather shower with the girls today.’”
On Trump’s 2005 remarks: “I certainly don’t condone what he said in what he thought was a private moment 11 years ago, but here’s a good reminder that in these times of ubiquitous microphones and cameras, there are no private moments. I can truly hope he’s genuinely contrite and has outgrown it and that he himself is as repulsed by it as are those who view it.”
Gov. Chris Christie
On transgender protections: “Men go to men’s rooms, women go to women’s rooms and there really shouldn’t be a whole lot of confusion about that_—_public accommodations. And I don’t think we should be making life more confusing for our children… The fact though is that we want our kids not to have to decide which bathroom they get to go in. And not to be subject to peer pressure about which one to go in. And not to be subject to the embarrassment that could come with going in a bathroom where somebody maybe doesn’t agree that they should be in there or not.”
On Trump’s 2005 remarks: Sen. Ted Cruz
On transgender protections: “You don’t have a right to intrude upon the rights of others because whether or not a man believes he’s a woman, there are a lot of women who would like to be able to use a public restroom in peace without having a man there_—_and when there are children involved, you don’t have a right to impose your lifestyle on others.”
On Trump’s 2005 remarks: “I am supporting the Republican nominee because I think Hillary Clinton is an absolute disaster. Now my differences with Donald, I have articulated at great length during the campaign. And I tried all my might. I got to tell you, it was an amazing journey.” Marco Rubio
On transgender protections: “Well, the executive orders would be to reverse the executive orders the President has made on things like gender equality in restrooms. You’ve seen some local districts and others been forced to, you know, provide girls access to a boys’ bathroom and so forth.”
On Trump’s 2005 remarks: “I disagree with him on many things, but I disagree with his opponent on virtually everything. I wish we had better choices for President. But I do not want Hillary Clinton to be our next President. And therefore my position has not changed.”
Tony Perkins, Family Research Council
On transgender protections:
 On Trump’s 2005 remarks: “As I have made clear, my support for Donald Trump in the general election was never based upon shared values rather it was built upon shared concerns… At this point in the political process, because of our lack of engagement and involvement as Christians, not just in this election but in the government and culture as a whole, we are left with a choice of voting for the one who will do the least damage to our freedoms.”
Ralph Reed, Faith and Freedom Coalition
On transgender protections: On Trump’s 2005 remarks: “I just don’t think an audiotape of an 11-year-old private conversation with an entertainment talk show host on a tour bus, for which the candidate has apologized profusely, is likely to rank high on the hierarchy of concerns of those faith-based voters.”
James Dobson
On transgender protections: “If you are a married man with any gumption, surely you will defend your wife’s privacy and security in restroom facilities. Would you remain passive after knowing that a strange-looking man, dressed like a woman, has been peering over toilet cubicles to watch your wife in a private moment? What should be done to the pervert who was using mirrors to watch women and girls in their stalls?”
On Trump’s 2005 remarks: “The comments Mr. Trump made 11 years ago were deplorable and I condemn them entirely. I also find Hillary Clinton’s support of partial birth abortion criminal and her opinion of evangelicals to be bigoted. There really is only one difference between the two. Mr. Trump promises to support religious liberty and the dignity of the unborn. Mrs. Clinton promises she will not.”
Gary Bauer, American Values
On transgender protections: “This is yet another example of the Obama administration’s bizarre obsession to force women to be unwilling participants in a radical social experiment… Now Obama’s HUD bureaucrats are putting those women at risk for abuse and worse by men claiming to be women.”
On Trump’s 2005 remarks: “ The comments are obviously disgusting and unfortunate. But Donald Trump did not run as a evangelical or as somebody who ran the kind of campaign that a Pat Robertson would run. We’ll still support him, still work hard for him. His policies are 100% better than Hillary clinton’s for the country. I don’t see how any values voter that is sensible would take a tape from 11 years ago with totally inappropriate language and says somehow that leads me as a voter to stay home or vote for Hillary Clinton or throw your vote away on a third party candidate.”
Robert Jeffress, First Baptist Church in Dallas On transgender protections: “Gender is an absolute, just like age is an absolute, and just because some hairy-legged man feels confused about his gender, doesn’t mean he gets to come in and shower with my daughter in a shower room.”
On Trump’s 2005 remarks: “It was lewd, obscene, indefensible_—_but not enough to make me want to vote for Hillary Clinton. I might not choose this man to be a Sunday school teacher at my church, but that’s not what this election is about.”
Franklin Graham
On transgender protections: On Trump’s 2005 remarks: Michele Bachmann
On transgender protections: “What we have seen happen since this discussion started, are men of varying ages going into women’s bathrooms and trying to videotape women unawares. Now that’s a real problem. And I think we need to be very clear that women, girls, older women are vulnerable and are deserving of protection.”
On Trump’s 2005 remarks: “This is bad boy talk, and of course that’s what [Hillary Clinton] wants everybody to talk about… If anybody understands bad boy talk, Hillary Clinton understands bad boy talk. She engages in a certain amount of it herself I think.”
Pat Robertson
On transgender protections: “We don’t want men going into women’s bathrooms, we don’t want predators going out where little girls are, we don’t want voyeurs having free access to the women’s locker rooms during games when they’re changing clothes.” On Trump’s 2005 remarks: “ “A guy does something 11 years ago, it was a conversation in Hollywood where he’s trying to look like he’s macho. And 11 years after that they surface it from The Washington Post or whatever, bring it out within 30 days or so of the election and this is supposed to be the death blow and everybody writes him off… They think he’s dead, he’s come back. And he came back strong. So, he won that debate.”
Pat McCrory (R), North Carolina governor
On transgender protections: “Does the desire to be politically correct outweigh our children’s privacy and safety? Not on my watch.” On Trump’s 2005 remarks: “I condemn in the strongest possible terms the comments made by Donald Trump regarding women. I find them disgusting.” [In Tuesday night’s gubernatorial debate, McCrory stood by his endorsement of Trump.]
Dan Patrick, Texas lieutenant governor
On transgender protections: “It is clear that the Obama administration is trying to force an ill-advised, eleventh-hour bathroom edict on Texas and all American schools that ignores both common sense and common decency. Obama’s bathroom policy, which applies to grades K-12, creates a problem where none existed. It will disrupt schools across Texas, creating potentially embarrassing and unsafe situations for girls who would be forced, under his order, to share bathrooms, locker rooms and showers with boys.”
On Trump’s 2005 remarks: Gary Cass, Defend Christians
On transgender protections:
 On Trump’s 2005 remarks:
 Phil Robertson, Duck Dynasty
On transgender protections: “Men should use the men’s bathroom and women should use the women’s bathroom. Just because a man may ‘feel’ like a woman doesn’t mean he should be able to share a bathroom with my daughter, or yours. That used to be called common sense. Now it’s called bigoted.”
On Trump’s 2005 remarks: “I would say [evangelical leaders] need to lighten up, start going out and preaching the gospel to different people, including Donald Trump, and give him some time to think about spiritual matters, and work with him, and not condemn anybody.”
Alveda King
On transgender protections: “In other words, by turning a blind eye to the dearth of perversion within our communities_—_the sex traffickers, child molesters, adulterers and fornicators, racists, and so many other sin sick souls_—_and suggesting that allowing everyone to use the same public bathrooms will solve America’s problems, the current government administration, no matter how well intended or ill advised they are, is headed for disaster.”
On Trump’s 2005 remarks: “ While writing, saying and doing much, Mr. Trump is apologizing for his past sins. He’s walking away from supporting abortion, hurling insults and more. Now, America needs to follow suit and apologize for the scourge of legal abortion that has left millions of empty cradles, wombs barren, women’s health damaged, and families broken. As Americans, we all need to follow Mr. Trump’s lead and ask God for forgiveness for the sins of our nation, and yes, for ourselves.”"
100527,1010,"Despite leaked Wall Street speech, Clinton’s policies show she would crack down on banks",https://thinkprogress.org/clinton-wall-street-wikileaks-97cdf50c087c#.r82z8qn5o,19,"Following through on its promise to leak internal emails in the Clinton campaign, Wikileaks on Friday published what it claims are emails from campaign chairman John Podesta’s account. The leaked documents purport to contain some of the paid remarks Clinton made for Wall Street firms, which she has refused to release publicly.
In one part of a speech she wrote for a financial audience, she apparently indicated that she believed Wall Street should be involved in writing regulations to oversee its own industry. “The people that know the industry better than anybody are the people who work in the industry,” she said, according to the leak.
The campaign hasn’t confirmed whether the documents are authentic, although it did not deny the speech excerpts were real when asked by the New York Times. The leaked emails also don’t have the full text of her speeches.
Clinton has been accused by both her Democratic and Republican rivals as being too close to Wall Street, and telling bankers that they should be helping to write their own rules could revive those arguments and anger proponents of reform. But the policies that she’s put forward since she delivered those speeches provide evidence that she would in fact crack down on Wall Street_—_while Donald Trump would let the industry off the hook.
Clinton has defended the Dodd-Frank financial reform act that has already cracked down on risky trades, addressed the problem of “too big to fail” banks, and set up the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB), which has delivered billions in relief for consumers from predatory banking behavior.
And she said she would go even further. She’s specifically called for stronger regulations for the so-called shadow banking sector, or financial activities that happen outside of traditional banking like hedge funds and derivatives traders that currently escape most oversight. She would also prioritize writing some rules that are still in process.
She’s vowed to prosecute and jail individual bankers for their misconduct, something almost everyone in the industry managed to escape after the financial crisis, and require them to admit when they were at fault. She would ban those found guilty from working in the industry. She would also extend the statute of limitations so that regulators would have more time to bring strong cases.
And she’s called for taxing high-frequency traders that use computers and algorithms to make money off of small market fluctuations and that have been blamed for destabilizing the markets.
During the Democratic primary, there were disagreements between Clinton and her rival Bernie Sanders over some other issues. Sanders proposed a financial transaction tax that would have been much broader than just taxing high-frequency trades and would have raised much more revenue. Sanders also called repeatedly for the reinstatement of Glass-Steagall, a Depression-era law that separated commercial banking from riskier investments, and breaking up the biggest banks. While the leaked emails show Clinton’s campaign considering getting behind Glass-Steagall, she ultimately never did.
All of Clinton’s policy proposals stand in stark contrast to what her Republican rival Donald Trump has put forward so far.
Trump has called for “dismantling” Dodd-Frank’s financial regulations, which would reverse any progress the law has made and eliminate the CFPB. He would also go even further and stop the country for enacting any new financial regulations until the economy shows “significant growth,” although it’s unclear when that would be.
While Trump’s tax plan follows through on his promise to get rid of the carried interest loophole that lets private equity and hedge fund managers pay lower taxes on their income_—_something Clinton has promised to accomplish as well, using executive powers if necessary_—_he gives Wall Street other benefits. Beyond lowering the top tax rates for the wealthy and corporations, he would also lower the capital gains tax, or the tax rate paid on investment income rather than from salaries.
Trump has also accused Clinton of being “owned” by Wall Street because she’s taken tens of millions in donations from people in the industry. Yet Trump’s economic advisers team is stacked with people who come directly from finance and has also taken millions in donations from the industry."
100528,1010,"Outside Republican headquarters, young women demand that GOP leaders denounce Trump",https://thinkprogress.org/allofus-rnc-trump-433a20b9ed32#.hvzhlo8ov,19,"WASHINGTON, DC_—_Sitting on the steps of the Republican National Committee’s headquarters Tuesday morning, dozens of young women demanded that party chairman Reince Priebus and House Speaker Paul Ryan denounce Donald Trump.
After being pushed out of the building by security guards, the protesters sang and blocked the entrance to the party’s building for almost an hour. “The GOP has always been an old boys club” and “Women reject Donald Trump and the GOP’s hate,” their banners declared.
After a weekend in which many GOP lawmakers backed away from Trump following the release of a video in which he makes lewd sexual comments, Priebus pledged “complete fidelity” to Trump, while Ryan said he would no longer actively campaign for or defend the nominee. But the women affiliated with protest group AllofUs 2016 said those responses are insufficient.

Natalie Green, a 24-year-old Washington, DC resident, told ThinkProgress that Trump’s comments especially disturbed her as someone who has experienced sexual assault. Green said she was molested by her white stepfather for many years, and his prison sentence was shorter than the length of time he molested her.
“As a survivor of sexual assault, the idea that we actually have someone who’s a sexual predator who could be just a second away from being president is absolutely disgusting to me,” she said.
“Everything Trump has said for the last year and a half has disgusted me, but what happened on Friday, that should disqualify you from being able to speak for the American people,” she continued. “Even for Donald Trump’s standards, it’s disgusting.”
During the protest, Green was one of four women who spoke out about their personal experiences. Bolivian immigrant Ambar Pinto declared that she is “undocumented and unafraid” and Anna Bonomo called Trump a “sexual predator.”
Watch some of the protest: From the building on the south side of the U.S. Capitol, the group sang the protest anthem “Which side are you on?” and chanted together: “Well, I went down to GOP and I took back what they stole from me.” They repeatedly called on Preibus and Ryan to denounce Trump’s misogyny.
“The Republican Party continues to run a sexual predator for president of the United States,” Bonomo told ThinkProgress.
Bonomo was also one of nearly a dozen people who were arrested at the Capitol last month when a group of people, also affiliated with AllofUs 2016, stormed to Ryan’s congressional office to tell him that his “racism is showing.” Though none of the protesters were arrested outside the RNC on Monday_—_security forcefully removed them from the building, but allowed them to continue the demonstration outside_—_Bonomo said she was willing to risk arrest again.
“If that’s what it takes to end the Republican Party’s funding to Donald Trump, then yes,” she said. “If it comes to that, I will.” "
100529,1001,Trump campaign brags about praise from someone Trump once called a 'Hitler-lover',http://www.dailykos.com/stories/2016/10/12/1581443/-Trump-campaign-brags-about-praise-from-someone-Trump-once-called-a-Hitler-lover,20,"Back in 1999 and 2000, Donald Trump had high-minded objections to Pat Buchanan because “he’s a Hitler-lover. I guess he’s an anti-Semite. He doesn’t like the blacks, he doesn’t like the gays.” This week, Trump’s campaign sent out a press release bragging about a column Buchanan wrote praising Trump and supporting his presidential run.

So what changed? How do you get to “hey, he likes me!” from: 

… he’s a Hitler-lover. I guess he’s an anti-Semite. He doesn’t like the blacks, he doesn’t like the gays
It’s simple. Back when Trump had such a problem with Buchanan, they were both considering a run for president on the Reform Party ticket. When Trump criticized Buchanan for liking Hitler and not liking “the blacks” or “the gays,” he went on to say:

… maybe he’ll get 4 or 5 percent of the vote and it’ll be a really staunch right wacko vote. I’m not even sure if it’s right. It’s just a wacko vote.
In other words: “I’m a better candidate than this guy because I’m more mainstream.” And then Barack Obama became president and Trump discovered the power of birtherism and appealing to the wacko racist vote, and suddenly he didn’t like the blacks so much, either. And if Buchanan likes Trump, then Trump likes Buchanan.

Republicans have started warning their increasingly ostracized nominee to stop stoking his supporters with claims that the 2016 election will be stolen, daring him to show proof or put a lid on it.
“Somebody claiming in the election, ‘I was defrauded,’ that isn’t going to cut it,” said former Sen. Kit Bond, a Missouri Republican who earlier in the campaign endorsed Jeb Bush and then Marco Rubio. “They’re going to have to say how, where, why, when.”

“I don’t think leading candidates for the presidency should undercut the process unless you have a really good reason,” Sen. Lindsey Graham, a South Carolina Republican who gained little support for his own 2016 White House run, told POLITICO.
Even Ohio's Secretary of State Jon Husted—one of the most devoted voter suppressors in the country—has had to step in to debunk a fake news story that claimed there were ""one dozen black, sealed ballot boxes filled with thousands of Franklin County votes for Hillary Clinton and other Democratic candidates."" Of course, he had to add ""I for a long time have been critical of people in both political parties who have tried to undermine public confidence in our election, rather by saying the election is going to be rigged or suggesting that people are being disenfranchised."" As one of the most notorious of disenfranchisers, up there with Kris Kobach, that's pretty fucking rich.

When Husted is complaining about someone complaining about voter fraud, you can bet that he's worried his whole gig is about to be up. Trump has the capability to completely discredit the movement with his bombast, to lay bare the real intent behind all of the voter suppression efforts—the racist intent of keeping people of color from voting. Trump's not even bothering to use a dog whistle anymore. He's using a bullhorn.

Husted and other Republicans need to keep some semblance of reasonableness, of plausibility when they talk ""voter fraud"" to keep the game going. Trump could ruin that for them. That's why they're trying to make him shut up about it.

It’s reportedly going to get even worse:

Mr. Trump, in fact, is trying to use his break with many party leaders as a lever to ramp up support among his base, which includes many voters who feel equally estranged from the party establishment.

The decision means that a campaign already marked by intensely personal attacks is primed to grow even uglier in the remaining four weeks. Mr. Trump plans to keep up a relentless assault on Mrs. Clinton, including her use of a private email server and allegations about her husband, former President Bill Clinton, with the intention of keeping some of her supporters home on Election Day, his advisers said.
Michelle Obama set one of the refrains of this election in her Democratic National Convention speech: “When they go low, we go high.” Trump is apparently hoping to turn it into “When I go low, they stay home.”

The thing is, it’s unlikely that even Donald Trump can go low enough and ugly enough to suppress the Democratic vote so much that he’ll beat Hillary Clinton. But the Senate and maybe even the House hang in the balance, and we need maximum Democratic turnout to win those and give Clinton a governing majority. That is why it’s important not to let him define this race and keep people home.

Daily Kos is expanding the map—we’ve just endorsed three more House candidates. Can you give each of them $3?

100532,1002,WikiLeaks: Clinton Aides Used Keystone Opposition to Distract from Email Scandal,http://www.breitbart.com/2016-presidential-race/2016/10/12/wikileaks-clinton-aides-used-keystone-opposition-distract-email-scandal/,20,"Washington (AFP) – Hillary Clinton’s campaign aides last year used the Keystone oil pipeline project to try to divert attention away from her use of private email while serving as secretary of state, according to emails released by WikiLeaks.
The Canada-US pipeline project, finally rejected by President Barack Obama’s administration in November 2015, had crystallized the debate over energy and the environment in the United States.

It was fiercely opposed by Bernie Sanders, Clinton’s rival in the Democratic primary elections to pick the party’s presidential nominee.

In August 2015, several months before the Obama administration announced its decision, Clinton’s advisers wondered how to reveal her opposition to the Keystone project, the emails show. Until then she had made no public stance.

“We are trying to find a good way to leak her opposition to the pipeline without her having to actually say it and give up her principled stand about not second-guessing the president in public,” wrote speechwriter Dan Schwerin.

Clinton’s campaign manager Robby Mook came up with a different solution: publicly state her opposition. That “will solicit criticism… but that might help distract from emails,” he said, according to the leaked messages.

The controversy over Clinton’s use of a private email server while she was the Obama administration’s top diplomat was in full swing at the time, forcing her to publicly apologize for its use in September.

The idea of publishing an op-ed article stating her opposition to Keystone was also discussed.

“Given that we just offered an apology on emails that some reporters think happened ‘on a dime’ after months of resistance, do we worry that publishing an oped… will be greeted cynically and perhaps as part of some manufactured attempt to project sincerity?,” wrote campaign spokesman Brian Fallon.

Clinton eventually announced her opposition to Keystone at a campaign rally in late September 2015.

The emails recently released by WikiLeaks also reveal Clinton was wary of supporting a bill to separate commercial and investment banks, a financial reform championed by Sanders and the left wing of the Democratic Party.

“I understand that we face phoniness charges if we ‘change’ our position” by supporting the law, wrote campaign aide Mandy Grunwald. “But we face political risks this way, too.”

Clinton ended up refusing to support such a law.

In other documents recently released by WikiLeaks, Clinton, in private speeches to major banks in 2013 and 2014, expressed views in favor of free trade and Wall Street self-regulation that are at odds with her positions as a candidate.

Clinton won the Democratic presidential nomination in July of this year.

With non-coincidental timing, Zeid Ra’ad al Hussain, the United Nations’ “High Commissioner” for “Human Rights”, added that electing Mr. Trump would be dangerous for the planet.

It is worth recalling why the GOP in Congress decided that it would no longer drift along with the imagined (and imaginary) scientific “consensus” that manmade global warming is or may become a dangerous global crisis.

Some years ago, during testimony to the GOP caucus on a House global-warming committee before the full meeting, one of us displayed this graph from the Fourth Assessment Report of the UN’s climate panel, the IPCC: The UN had falsely claimed the graph proved the rate of global warming was accelerating and we were to blame. The truth, as the two transparent yellow arrows we have added to the graph shows, is that from 1860-1880 as well as from 1910-1940 the rate of global warming was the same as from 1980-2005. There has been no acceleration.

John Linder, the GOP ranking member on the committee (for the House was still under “Democrat” control at that time) took one look at the graph and said, “They can’t have done that!” He turned to his fellow-members and said, “Gentlemen, we have now seen all we need to see. The UN and its climate panel are anti-scientific and untrustworthy.” And so they are. The GOP has had no time for these scamsters ever since.

Both of us have had long experience of tackling the falsehoods peddled by Gore, Clinton and the self-serving UN Let us knock some of them on the head.

First, the rate of global warming has not been accelerating. In fact, it is little more than half of what the UN had predicted in 1990, even though, despite the squandering of hundreds of billions on the climate scam, CO2 emissions are rising faster than predicted.

Secondly, Hurricane Matthew was no worse for global warming. Until it struck the U.S. coast, no hurricane of category 3 or more had made landfall for 4001 days – the longest period without a major hurricane landfall in the U.S. since records began almost 150 years ago. Warmer weather reduces the temperature differentials that drive storms, making severe hurricanes less likely.

Thirdly, sea level, which Gore and Clinton said was a big issue for Florida’s coastline, has not been accelerating, though the south-eastern seaboard of the U.S. has been subsiding.

Fourthly, there is no “consensus”. Two of us were co-authors of a paper printed last year that examined 11,944 peer-reviewed papers on climate and related subject published in the learned journals over the 21 years 1991-2001. Just 41 papers – 0.3 percent of the sample – went as far as to say that what little global warming there has been in recent decades was mostly manmade.

In 2007, one of us ran ads in major daily papers throughout the U.S. challenging Al Gore to a debate about global warming. He was too terrified to accept. In 2009, one of us asked him how much global warming would be prevented if the U.S. stopped emitting CO2 altogether. Gore could not answer: for the truth is that global temperature would barely change.

The cost of compliance with the Paris climate agreement has been estimated at $90 trillion over the next 14 years. Yet that monstrous sum – four times the entire federal debt – would not even reduce global temperature by a tenth of a degree.

Measures to tackle global warming that are inexpensive enough to be ineffective will be unaffordable. Measures that are expensive enough to be effective are unaffordable. And there is no climate crisis anyway. As a recent Pew survey showed, the global warming scam is now a vote-loser for its promoters. We, the people, are no longer fooled."
100534,1002,Penny Nance: Seven Examples of Hillary Clinton’s Bad Judgment,http://www.breitbart.com/2016-presidential-race/2016/10/12/top-seven-examples-hillarys-bad-judgement/,20,"Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton says repeatedly that her record speaks for itself.
I agree. The message? “Danger Ahead!”

Clinton’s incredibly poor judgment follows her wherever she goes. Just taking the last eight years (not to pound on the infamous scandals of the 1990s), after she lost her first presidential bid to President Obama, show a disturbing pattern. Here are what I found to be the top seven most disturbing cases of bad judgment in the last eight years, in no particular order:

She defended Planned-Parenthood’s selling of baby body parts
As Planned Parenthood spiraled out of control, exposed for unethical — if not illegal and disgusting — activities, Hillary Clinton stood steadfast at their side, no questions asked. Instead, she turned on the investigators, as well as the accusers (I’m seeing a pattern there), despite the evidence, as she has done so many times before, saying, “I think it is unfortunate that Planned Parenthood has been the object of such a concerted attack for so many years. And it’s really an attack against a woman’s right to choose. … I’m hoping this situation will not further undermine the very important services that Planned Parenthood provides across our country.”

She wants activist Supreme Court Justices
It is no secret that the appointment of Supreme Court justices by the next president has become a major issue in the campaign.  It’s also no secret that Hillary has immense support for the recent court rulings that have progressed further and further away from constitutional democracy and closer and closer to a bizarre set of legislative authority from the court. The lower courts, too, have taken such a turn. On issues important to many Americans — from safer abortion clinics to religious freedom to the definition of marriage to ObamaCare’s government overreach — the court has gone too far.

At the most recent debate, she was asked about the types of justices she would appoint, and she didn’t even mention the Constitution, only the decisions she wants (Roe was, of course, at the top):

I want to appoint Supreme Court justices who understand the way the world works, who have real-life appearance, maybe they tried more cases, understand what people are up against.  I think the current Court has gone in the wrong direction, so I would want to see the Supreme Court reverse Citizens United and get dark money out of our politics. Donald doesn’t support that. Voting rights are a big part of our country, we don’t always do everything to ensure that everybody can exercise their franchise.  I want a Supreme Court that will stick with Roe v. Wade. And Donald Trump has put together some candidates, and they will reverse Roe v. Wade and marriage equality.

She compromised national security and tried to cover it up
Hillary saw fit to set up her own e-mail server processing classified information. Many Americans don’t understand the full extent of the problems here. She was not just using a personal e-mail address; she was using a separate server to escape government oversight. She left that server exposed to all kinds of hacking of national security information that we must now assume are in anyone’s hands. The casual handling of classified information is disturbing enough, but so are the attempts to cover it all up. At first, she said there was no classified material, a claim later repudiated by FBI Director James Comey.

Her IT guys pled the Fifth Amendment to avoid giving full information at the investigative hearing; many are being given immunity, even though they don’t give any information, and we may never know the full extent of the layers of this scandal.

Contributed to the rise and growth of ISIS
Hillary was in support of Obama’s policies to reduce our military presence in the Middle East, specifically in Iraq, an act which many experts say gave rise to ISIS in the region. ISIS atrocities have now spread across the globe, manifesting in everything from the shocking attacks on regular western lives at concerts and event venues, to forced sex trafficking of minority religious sects, to stealing and radicalizing young people through cyber recruitment, to horrifying religious persecution and murder of Christians. Meanwhile, Clinton minimizes the flagrant persecutions and, like President Obama, even refuses to call the problem what it is: radical Islamic terrorism.

Was the main figure in the Benghazi debacle
During Clinton’s role as Secretary of State, there were also quite serious reports of mismanagement. Of particular concern is how she ignored the pleas for help in Libya which led directly to the Benghazi attacks and the death of Ambassador Chris Stevens. Her reactions after the fact were even more concerning. She flagrantly lied, pretending she had nothing to do with it, and her shameful deceptions about a YouTube video causing the attacks are embarrassingly dangerous. What sort of tricks could she pull when given the full power of the presidency?

Improperly used her position as Secretary of State for personal gain through the Clinton Foundation
Behind the philanthropic façade, the Clinton Foundation has been plagued with scandals, all pointing to the undisputable fact that Secretary Clinton’s position and influence was used by the foundation for the personal and organizational financial gain of the Clintons and their friends. As PJ Media reports:

The Clinton Foundation dispenses contracts to Clinton cronies like Doug Band while also paying for the non-political travel of the Clintons and staffers. It’s all perfectly legal — and disgustingly unethical. The Foundation is used as a slush fund that enriches friends of the Clintons while allowing foreign businesses and governments to purchase influence.

Made deplorable comments about Americans who dare not support her
If you don’t agree with Hillary, there’s a 50 percent chance you are simply “deplorable.” Clinton’s critique of Trump supporters claimed this half was full of those who were “racist, sexist, homophobic, xenophobic, Islamaphobic, you name it.” This shouldn’t simply be taken as a flippant comment in the heat of election season — it’s a serious look at how Clinton really feels about views that challenge her own, and more importantly, how she attacks political opponents. We can expect the attacks on conservatives, like the targeting of the IRS under President Obama, will only expand in a Clinton Administration.

100535,1003,There Is No Morality Left In The Moral Majority,http://www.huffingtonpost.com/james-peron/there-is-no-morality-left_b_12462476.html?utm_hp_ref=politics,20,"Christian fundamentalism has always presented itself as a morally superior group in direct touch with God, following the Bible, and at war with secular society.

What aspects of society they want to defeat may vary. In the early 1900s they were obsessed with Jews, evolution and immigration. As such they formed the backbone of the revived Ku Klux Klan.

The moralistic fundamentalist was, however, largely a Democrat and even sometimes a Progressive. People forget the Progressives and the Democrats were quite openly racist at the time. The most successful fundamentalist in American politics was anti-evolution crusader William Jennings Bryan, who was the presidential candidate of both the Democrats and the Progressives.

By the 1960s fundamentalists started abandoning the Democrats as the party moved toward acceptance of civil rights for black Americans.

Evangelist John R. Rice, the editor of the voice of fundamentalism, The Sword of the Lord, warned: “It is better for both Negroes and whites to run with their own kind and intermarry with their own kind. The mixing of races widely differing is almost never wise...Thus if a girl would do wrong to marry a Negro boy, she would be wrong to keep company with him, mixing regularly with him in social life.”

To Rice, who spoke for the majority of fundamentalists of his day, integration was a communist plot where “hotheads in the North advocate using armed forces to compel white people and colored people to send their children to the same schools, while in the South, leading men in the government and out have banded themselves together to avoid what they think would result in intermarriage and the mongrelization of the race and the breakdown of all the southern standards of culture.”

At each stage of their campaign they presented their prejudices as if they were gospel. Since they hated Jews, blacks, Mormons, Catholics, immigrants, God hated them as well, or at the very least, would tolerate them if they kept to their assigned place in society.

Fundamentalist politics was always a combination of two things: hatred for groups they targeted and their own moral superiority. They were “God’s people” in direct touch with Jesus and following divine orders. They were redeemed and forgiven and all others were filthy sinners unworthy of respect or rights.

The moralistic cloak was used to cover the true source of their activism—their animosity and contempt for groups they targeted.

They succeeded in taking over the Republican Party and turned it away from Goldwater’s view of limited government, into one of Big Brotherism in the name of Christian morality. The problem was their version of morality seemed focused more on individuals private sex lives then on how we treated one another. It’s hard to discuss “love thy neighbor” when one is scapegoating Mexicans, gays, Jews, Catholics, Muslims, or others.

At the very least they worked to disguise their own hypocrisy. Those of us who escaped Christian fundamentalism know what a moral cesspool it is. My Christian high school was run by the largest fundamentalist church in America. The pastor had a long-term relationship with his married secretary and housed her a few blocks from his own home. His son, who became a pastor, was caught having affairs with multiple women. The pastor’s son-in-law took over the church and then went to prison for seducing an underage female who came to see him about being the victim of sexual abuse. Yet, the principal of the school was the man who got Jerry Falwell to start the Moral Majority.

But now it seems these people are willing to chuck all pretense of supporting morality and focus exclusively on their prejudices and hates.

What they see as God’s Own Party, the GOP, has nominated a man who is utterly amoral. Republicans in nominated Donald Trump abdicated any right to assert they defend “traditional morality” or common decency.

Their candidate makes lewd remarks about him sexually assaulting women and, instead of being horrified they make excuses. I’ve seen Republicans claim it doesn’t matter since Trump was a Democrat at the time, others have tried to justify it by saying Bill Clinton was a philanderer. Trump’s excuse was he’s heard Bill Clinton say worst. But Trump and truth aren’t exactly on speaking terms—no matter what the topic.

Jerry Falwell’s heir, his son, is sticking by Trump and so is the ultra-fundamentalist James Dobson, who has spent decades attacking gay people for their supposed immorality. Fundamentalism has always preached a morality they want imposed on others, but when they are caught rolling in the mud, it’s one excuse after another.

Morality in fundamentalist circles is merely a blunt weapon used to beat others over the head; it is not something they ever apply to themselves. Their morality is a weapon to be used against others, not a guidepost for their own lives."
100536,1003,Trump’s Supreme Court Justices Would Roll Back A Century Of Progress,http://www.huffingtonpost.com/nan-aron/trumps-supreme-court-just_b_12386622.html?utm_hp_ref=politics,20,"Ever eager to assure conservatives he’s their best bet to cement an ultraconservative majority on the Supreme Court, Donald Trump recently announced ten more names he’d add to the pool of people he might name to the Court if elected. The new list made a token nod to diversity and brought the total of potential Trump nominees to 20:21 if you include the apparently blindsided Senator Mike Lee, who clearly didn’t know he was a Trump pick and hurriedly bowed out. It also reinforced what was abundantly clear when Trump unveiled his first list of “great” Supreme Court picks: the men and women that Donald Trump wants on the Court have clear records of hostility to rights and freedoms we all take for granted.

Here’s a sampling.

Start with a name on Trump’s latest list, Florida Supreme Court Justice Charles Canady. His far-right record includes a death-penalty ruling so indefensible that when it reached the U.S. Supreme Court even the court’s arch-conservatives, Chief Justice Roberts, Justice Scalia, and Justice Thomas, agreed it was unconstitutional. As a Congressman, Canady led the charge to impeach President Bill Clinton.

Two more from the new list, Judges Neil Gorsuch and Timothy Tymkovich of the Tenth Circuit Court of Appeals, helped set women’s health back decades in the infamous Hobby Lobby case, when they ruled that for-profit corporations can be treated as persons exercising religious freedom in denying reproductive health care to women employees.

Voting rights are an issue that seems to rub at least two Trump favorites the wrong way: Judge Diane Sykes of the Seventh Circuit Court of Appeals voted to reinstate Wisconsin’s blatantly discriminatory voter ID law, while Michigan Chief Justice Robert Young wrote an opinion upholding the state’s voter ID law that dissenting judges called “tragic” and likely to further harm the state’s “impoverished and disadvantaged.”

Then there’s Justice David Stras of the Minnesota Supreme Court, who once lamented that the U.S. Supreme Court has ventured “into contentious areas of social policy—such as school integration, abortion, and homosexual rights.” What kind of judge thinks school integration is still contentious? Apparently, one who Trump thinks is “great.”

Next we have Utah State Supreme Court Justice Thomas Lee, who once questioned whether Utah Physicians for a Healthy Environment had standing to challenge the permit for a refinery that would add significant new levels of pollution to the region. Why? Because he assumed the economic interest of the doctors was actually better served by more people getting sick from the contamination of the air.

Another Trump favorite, Judge Steven Colloton of the Eighth Circuit, authored decisions letting Tyson Foods get away with $24 million in wage theft from its employees. No friend to workers, Judge Colloton wrote on another occasion that a woman who reported sexual harassment could not take legal action when her employer allegedly retaliated by firing her.

And there’s Eleventh Circuit Court Judge William Pryor, who thinks Miranda v. Arizona, which requires that people be advised of their rights when arrested, and Roe v. Wade, which established a woman’s right to an abortion, are “the worst examples of judicial activism.” 

The examples are troubling, because Trump clearly prefers judges who would turn back the clock on long-established fundamental rights, and who favor the powerful over the interests of everyone else.

The most frightening part is that the stakes this year couldn’t be higher. Whoever is elected president in November will likely determine what the Constitution means for the rest of our lives. There are three justices will be in their 80s during the next president’s first term, and there is the distinct possibility—if not probability—that there will be multiple vacancies to fill. And, of course, there is already one vacancy caused by the death of Antonin Scalia, for which President Obama has nominated the highly qualified, widely respected Merrick Garland. Senate Republicans, clinging to the hope that Trump will get to nominate someone for the seat instead, have refused to do their job and give Garland the vote to which he is entitled.

During the upcoming presidential debates, including the one this Sunday, Trump should be pushed to explain why he supports the judicial philosophies of the people on his lists. Because once Americans learn what these individuals really stand for, our bet is that - like Trump Steaks - the public won’t buy what Trump is selling. Our research into voter attitudes has found that, overwhelmingly, Americans expect Supreme Court justices to ensure that the Constitution protects all of us, not just special interests. Voters care deeply about the Supreme Court. They want justices who will support the principle of liberty, equality, and justice for all of us. Donald Trump’s Supreme Court justices, by contrast, would roll back a century of economic and social progress."
100537,1003,Who Is The Kremlin’s Choice For U.S. President?,http://www.huffingtonpost.com/christopher-burgess/who-is-the-kremlins-choic_b_12377840.html?utm_hp_ref=politics,20,"The US presidential election of 2016 is entertaining the world. The sad reality is one of the two major party candidates, Donald Trump (R) or Hillary Clinton (D) will be the next president of the United States come Friday, January 20, 2017. The US electorate dislikes them both. Global leaders and their intelligence and foreign policy apparatus are burning the midnight oils as they try and put their arms around what is coming to the global stage come 2017. If it wasn’t scaring the shit out of me, and so many others, then it would actually be humorous.

While the decision day of November 8, 2016 is fast approaching the US electorate, it is regrettable many will find themselves voting for the presidential candidate they think sucks less.

The Kremlin, led by Vladimir Putin, has made their choice early on.

A powerful statement. One may argue, countries don’t attempt to influence the affairs or elections of another country? To that I say, open your history books.The Russian Federation uses their intelligence community to achieve their goals, their “active measures” (________ ___________) capabilities are fully operational.They are not alone, the United States uses their intelligence community and covert action capability in a similar manner, often times directed by Presidential findings and directives. Every country takes steps to protect their national interests, to influencing the actions within another country. Scan the headlines you will see examples such as the one in the Indian Express, “Everywhere the foreign hand.”

Those familiar with the ways of the former Soviet Union, will recognize the Soviet Realpolitik toy box was never thrown out, it was simply repainted and refreshed by the Russian Federation, moreso under Putin than others. Their adroitness at Chess (_______), a national pastime in Russia, is demonstrated as they move their pieces across the global landscape, reflecting their mastery of the gambit.

The US government is not naive on the role of Russian active measures, and in fact, Section 501 of the Intelligence Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2017 (which started 01 October). Includes specific verbiage directing the US intelligence community, “requires the President to establish an 
interagency committee to counter active measures by the Russian Federation that constitute Russian actions to exert covert influence over peoples and governments.”

Clinton
The Kremlin knows Clinton, they have danced with Clinton for more than 16 years, most intensively and directly during her term as Secretary of State. They respect her for her connectedness, both domestically and abroad, and marvel at 112 countries visited and the 956,733 miles she traveled as Secretary of State.

Trump
The Kremlin knows Trump, and the Russian oligarchs know him better than the politicos. They know his money, and he knows theirs. They respect the bazzari manner he displays, negotiate agree and negotiate some more. It is not alien in the Russian markets.

Russian active measures

The Democratic National Committee (DNC) hack has been well documented and discussed ad nauseum. I crafted a piece in June, Hacking Politics - Political Security in an Election Year, which discussed why Russia would be interested in the content of the DNC servers. I said then, “political parties plan to win, so lists and analysis on best candidates for key administration posts (cabinet and select appointees) will always be of interest to an adversary, as will the national security transition. Once the national primaries are concluded and the candidates for president solidified, these individuals will begin receiving national security briefings.”

The Russian’s have the Clinton transition game plan.

Are we tired of hearing about Hillary’s email server? Absolutely. Let’s step over the discussion on whether or not classified correspondence was kept on these servers kept in her personal residence. Indeed, let’s assume, all the content was considered only sensitive and intra-office discussions.

From a foreign intelligence perspective, the content may not be platinum, due to lack of classified information, but it sure as hell is a treasure trove of gold. Containing the thoughts, methodologies, connections, interconnections and other jewels to assist an adversary in determining the plans and intentions of a leader.

The FBI Director James Comey, concludes that it is possible that hostile actors gained access to the email servers. Comey’s statement on the topic in July 2016, “With respect to potential computer intrusion by hostile actors, we did not find direct evidence that Secretary Clinton’s personal e-mail domain, in its various configurations since 2009, was successfully hacked. But, given the nature of the system and of the actors potentially involved, we assess that we would be unlikely to see such direct evidence. We do assess that hostile actors gained access to the private commercial e-mail accounts of people with whom Secretary Clinton was in regular contact from her personal account. We also assess that Secretary Clinton’s use of a personal e-mail domain was both known by a large number of people and readily apparent. She also used her personal e-mail extensively while outside the United States, including sending and receiving work-related e-mails in the territory of sophisticated adversaries. Given that combination of factors, we assess it is possible that hostile actors gained access to Secretary Clinton’s personal e-mail account.”

The NSA tools go missing
In August 2016 realized that the National Security Agency’s offensive operations group had lost their tool box. Indeed, the toolbox was splayed out for all to see by Shadow Brokers. In my piece, NSA’s Tools Go Missing to Shadow Brokers, I commented how this theft and subsequent exposure, was “a signal to the United States from Russia, let the cyber-espionage games begin, we have your toys.”

The Kremlin’s Choice

The Russian playbook when it comes to Hillary Clinton is robust, complex and complete. Trump is a wildcard. They know him only in the context of his business acumen. The current residents in the Kremlin view Trump in the same way they viewed Ronald Reagan, an unpredictable gadfly. But Trump isn’t Reagan. Say what you will about Reagan and his Hollywood roots, he surrounded himself with subject matter experts who were on point.

Thus Putin continues to snub and embarrass the US in the diplomatic scrums at the G20, Syria, Ukraine, Crimea, NATO, etc. They feed their propaganda machines, RT, Pravda and others with global opinion on how Trump’s isolationist policy is in their interests. They create opportunity for the US media to grab soundbites and relish when Trump provides his own, leaving the public without comment on the “bromance” between Trump and Putin.

Others have concluded the Russian activity is in support of Donald Trump, and there can be a cogent argument made which arrives at this conclusion. I submit, this is a Russian gambit, a beautifully mastered piece of reverse psychology which is being consumed by the US media, like a child consumes cotton candy. Indeed, the US media is not only buying it, they are serving it up to the US electorate in an unending narrative, that a vote for Trump is a vote for Russia.

But the reality is, they prefer the devil they know. The Kremlin chooses Hillary Clinton

Vote
I am apolitical, revolted by both candidates, Clinton and Trump. But I will vote, and I encourage every eligible US citizen both at home and abroad to exercise their vote for this election. And whether or not the Kremlin get’s who they wish in the White House, we the electorate aren’t embracing the behavior of the emu. We will be able to marshall our national resources and be both “stronger together” and “a greater america” at the same time, regardless of who is President of the United States on January 21, 2017."
100538,1004,Trump Camp Responds To NYT Report: 'The Entire Article Is Fiction',http://talkingpointsmemo.com/livewire/trump-camp-responds-to-nyt-report-the-entire-article-is-fiction,20,"Trump campaign spokesman Jason Miller released a statement Wednesday responding to a New York Times report on allegations by two women that Trump groped each of them decades apart.

The report detailed allegations that Trump groped one woman on an airplane decades ago and kissed another woman at Trump Tower in 2005. The story was released late on Wednesday night and the Trump campaign quickly denied the allegations.

“This entire article is fiction, and for the New York Times to launch a completely false, coordinated character assassination against Mr. Trump on a topic like this is dangerous. To reach back decades in an attempt to smear Mr. Trump trivializes sexual assault, and it sets a new low for where the media is willing to go in its efforts to determine this election,"" Miller said in a release posted on the Trump Campaign's website.

""It is absurd to think that one of the most recognizable business leaders on the planet with a strong record of empowering women in his companies would do the things alleged in this story, and for this to only become public decades later in the final month of a campaign for president should say it all.""

The Trump campaign quickly alleged media bias.

""Further, the Times story buries the pro-Clinton financial and social media activity on behalf of Hillary Clinton’s candidacy, reinforcing that this truly is nothing more than a political attack. This is a sad day for the Times,"" Miller said."
100539,1004,Report: FBI Suspects Russia In Hack Of Clinton Campaign Chair's Emails,http://talkingpointsmemo.com/livewire/wsj-fbi-suspects-russia-podesta-email-hack,20,"The FBI suspects Russian intelligence agencies directed the hacking of Hillary Clinton's campaign chair's emails, the Wall Street Journal reported Wednesday.

The Journal cited “people briefed on the investigations” who asserted that the FBI suspected Russia was behind the hack of John Podesta's emails. The unnamed sources said the FBI also believed Russia was behind the hacking of a Florida contractor, which revealed voters’ personal data.

Last Friday, the United States formally accused Russia of hacking political organizations including the Democratic National Committee and the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee. The statement blaming Russia for the hacks acknowledged that some states experienced ""scanning and probing"" of their election systems but stopped short of attributing that activity to the Russian government.

Meanwhile on Wednesday, the Journal reported that Russian President Vladimir Putin wondered aloud at an investors forum, “Everyone is saying, ‘Who did it?’. But does it matter that much? It’s what’s inside the information that matters.""

In an interview with CNN’s Christiane Amanpour, Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov seemed to soften his position as well.

“We did not deny this,” he said of the hacks, adding “They did not prove it.”

On Tuesday night, Podesta, whose hacked emails are currently being released in installments by Wikileaks, said he suspected Trump confidante Roger Stone knew of the upcoming leaks. Stone called Podesta's allegations “categorically false” and “without foundation.”"
100540,1004,Trump Goes On Tear About Debates: 'Why Can't Reince Feed Me Info?',http://talkingpointsmemo.com/livewire/donald-trump-debates-commission-wikileaks-florida-rally,20,"Donald Trump provided the crowd with a rundown of WikiLeaks’ recent document dumps at a Wednesday rally in Florida, claiming they offered hard evidence that Hillary Clinton was as “crooked” as he has argued.

Within moments of taking the stage in Ocala, Trump asked the crowd if they had seen WikiLeaks’ latest leaked documents. Referring to an email exchange between the campaign and Donna Brazile, then a CNN contributor and Democratic National Committee vice chair, the day before a Democratic primary town hall, Trump claimed that the DNC fed Clinton a question as part of its effort to ensure her victory against Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-VT).

“The DNC vice chair was feeding information, so much information to the candidate,” Trump said. “Oh man, why can’t the Republicans do that? Why can’t Reince feed me information prior to a debate? I am so angry at the Republicans. I want to be fed information like Hillary gets.”

“The Republicans are not doing their job,” Trump added, apparently joking. “They should be able to get me all of the questions prior to the debate.”

The leaked emails show Brazile sending a question regarding to the death penalty to Clinton spokeswoman Jennifer Palmieri the day before a March town hall, saying “here’s one that worries me about HRC.” A similar question was asked during the town hall the following day, but Brazile has denied feeding questions to the candidate.

“I never had access to questions and would never have shared them with the candidates if I did,"" Brazile told Politico in a statement, noting that she “often shared my thoughts with each and every campaign.”

While party committees do not determine questions for primary debates, either, Trump’s comments seemed to conflate the primary and presidential debates. The three presidential debates are organized by the non-profit, independent Commission for Presidential Debates and moderators are tasked with coming up with questions that they alone see before the debate.

Yet Trump suggested in Ocala that Clinton was currently being “fed information” by the DNC, and went on the attack against the debate commission.

""I have no respect for that group by the way, I'm done,"" Trump said, noting that co-chair Mike McCurry used to work for Bill Clinton.

Though the Republican nominee said this was further proof that the system was “rigged” in Clinton’s favor, the other co-chair, Frank Fahrenkopf, used to work for Ronald Reagan."
100541,1005,Multiple Accounts Emerge of Women Saying Trump Sexually Assaulted Them,http://www.motherjones.com/politics/2016/10/trump-women-groping-assault,20,"In the days after the Washington Post uncovered a 2005 tape of Donald Trump making lewd comments about women and bragging that he had kissed and groped women without their consent, the Republican nominee has repeatedly dismissed his remarks as merely ""locker room talk"" and denied that he ever engaged in such actions. When asked during the second presidential debate whether he had ever committed sexual assault, Trump proclaimed, ""No, I have not.""

But on Wednesday night, several news outlets posted stories with accounts from women who insisted that Trump had touched or kissed them inappropriately. The New York Times published the tale of two women who allege that Trump accosted them in precisely the way he described to Billy Bush in the 2005 video. The women decided to go public with their stories following Sunday night's debate, the Times reported, each saying they were infuriated by his denial.

One of the pair, Jessica Leeds, described Trump groping her on a plane:

More than three decades ago, when she was a traveling businesswoman at a paper company, Ms. Leeds said, she sat beside Mr. Trump in the first-class cabin of a flight to New York. They had never met before.

About 45 minutes after takeoff, she recalled, Mr. Trump lifted the armrest and began to touch her.

According to Ms. Leeds, Mr. Trump grabbed her breasts and tried to put his hand up her skirt.

""He was like an octopus,"" she said. ""His hands were everywhere.""

She fled to the back of the plane. ""It was an assault,"" she said.

The other woman, Rachel Crooks, told the Times she met Trump in an elevator in 2005 and that, after she introduced herself, Trump began kissing her on the cheek and then on the mouth. Crooks recalled that Trump later tried to get her number to pass it on to his modeling agency—an agency that, as several models told Mother Jones, exploited its models and also encouraged models to flout immigration laws. In an interview with the Times, Trump denied the women's accounts, asserting, ""None of this ever took place."" The campaign later released a statement calling the entire article ""fiction"" and a smear attempt. The Times story adds to a litany of reports that have recently emerged alleging Trump sexually assaulted women and acted inappropriately. A Florida woman says Trump groped her without consent in 2004, according to the Palm Beach Post. Cassandra Searles, who was Miss Washington 2013, has also claimed that Trump groped her. Four women who competed in a 1997 Teen USA beauty pageant told BuzzFeed News that Trump walked in on them while they were changing. And during a Miss USA beauty pageant in 2001, Trump entered a dressing room while the contestants were changing into bikinis.

Many of these accounts jibe with Trump's boasts to Billy Bush. Trump, though, insists that was just talk. But Trump, who has tried to make the actions of Bill Clinton from two to three decades ago a campaign issue, is confronting an expanding political crisis now fully focused not only on what he said about women but on what he might have done to these specific women and others.

100542,1005,"Trump Says He'll Imprison Clinton's Lawyers, Too",http://www.motherjones.com/politics/2016/10/donald-trump-says-hell-imprison-hillary-clintons-lawyers-too,20,"After Donald Trump called for Hillary Clinton to be jailed during Sunday's presidential debate, some Trump surrogates suggested he was simply joking, and his running mate Mike Pence said his remarks had been taken out of context. But at a Wednesday rally in Lakeland, Florida, Trump promised that no, he really did intend to throw Hillary Clinton in prison if elected—and to prosecute her lawyers for good measure.

In his afternoon speech outside an airplane hangar off I-4 in the center of the swing state, Trump offered his toughest words yet for the former secretary of state. ""Hillary Clinton bleached and deleted 33,000 emails after a congressional subpoena,"" he told the crowd. ""So she gets the subpoena, she gets the subpoena, and after—not before, that would be bad—but after getting the subpoena to give over your emails and lots of other things, she deleted the emails. She. Has. To. Go. To. Jail.""

Trump didn't stop there. He also wanted the people who advised her to delete the emails to be charged, arrested, and jailed. ""And her law firm, which is a very big and powerful law firm, which is the one that said, 'Oh, they'll determine what they're giving,' those representatives within that law firm that did that, have to go to jail,"" Trump said.

The rally was the third stop in a three-day swing through the Sunshine State, where Clinton has taken a small but steady lead during Trump's October collapse. Supporters packed onto the tarmac to wait for Trump's campaign plane to pull up, and some passed out from the heat before and during the event. When a woman who had collapsed earlier in his speech returned to the crowd to hear the ending, Trump praised her durability and took a shot at the National Football League's concussion policy. ""Uh! Uh!"" he said. ""A little ding in the head—you can't play the rest of the season.""

The prospect of prosecuting Clinton was a through-line of the event. Trump supporters donned ""Hillary for Prison"" T-shirts, and one attendee wore black-and-white stripes with a Hillary mask. When Rep. Dennis Ross, a Florida Republican who spoke before the plane had arrived, was interrupted with a chant of ""lock her up!"", he promised to help make it a reality. ""When he becomes president, we'll work on that,"" Ross said."
100543,1005,Here's Why Trump Supporters Say the Groping Tape Is No Big Deal,http://www.motherjones.com/politics/2016/10/donald-trump-supporters-respond-tape,20,"Donald Trump supporters got an unexpected welcome as they approached his Wednesday afternoon rally in Lakeland, Florida: Bob Welsh, a city commissioner from South Miami, had brought a set of speakers and was blaring the tape of Donald Trump bragging about sexual assault in 2005. The footage, which was obtained and published Friday by the Washington Post, shook up the presidential race and prompted dozens of Republican elected officials to formally abandon their party's presidential nominee. Welsh was taunting Trump's supporters, and had a sign for good measure: But the supporters who packed this rally hadn't lost any sleep over the tape. They offered different theories as to where the video might have come from and what it really means, but they agreed on one thing: He's still better than Crooked Hillary. As one middle-aged man put it, ""He apologized for it, and Hillary doesn't know how to apologize for anything.""

""I'm a guy, I've done worse,"" said Henry Dupuis, who told me he was an immigrant from Canada. ""Absolutely, me and my buddies? I'm serious about that.""

Worse than sexual assault, really?

""No, I'm just saying, well, call it…it's just words,"" Dupuis said. ""It's no action, compared to Bill Clinton. It's just words.""

""What did I think of it?,"" said Christine Lewis, from Lakeland. ""Honestly, I thought that was the most ridiculous setup from the GOP. They set it up, they planned it, because it's locker room banter—it's all it was. Every guy in the United States of America has talked about doing a girl. In the bathroom. Or in the locker room, or wherever—on the bus. Let me tell you this: How come—this is what pisses me off—how come she can call a bunch of challenged kids at an Easter Egg hunt 'retards' and there's no media coverage? That's way worse than him talking about banging some girl."" (Jones was referring to a claim made in a book written by a high school girlfriend of Bill Clinton, which posits that Hillary Clinton mocked disabled children as first lady of Arkansas.)

Lewis' friend Steve Peters told me, ""What guy doesn't talk like that? If he didn't talk like that I'd think there's something wrong with him.""

Another Trump supporter, Diane (whose husband encouraged her not to give her last name) offered the entertainment industry defense: ""There's a lot of people in Hollywood, a lot of music people, rappers, that say a lot more dangerous and nasty language. And you know what? That language that Trump said in that was years ago, and it hasn't killed anybody. And Hillary Clinton's actions as secretary of state got people killed in Benghazi.""

""It doesn't really affect me,"" said Lew Gaskins of nearby Bartow. ""He's never been a politician. He's always been a caricature, a TV star, so things like that are gonna be in his past. I think Billy Bush goaded him into it. He was just throwing out bravado, he wasn't married at the time. I think they're disgusting, every one of them."" (Trump was married to Melania at the time of the interview.)

David Jones, who wore a blue shirt with the word ""Deplorable,"" said the media should focus on something else: ""What do they think about the tape that they're just playing today about Obama showing his erection on his plane in 2008?"" he asked me. The tape? ""Yeah, it's all over the internet now. It's all over what's his name, what's the conservative guy's name? Drudge."" (You can watch the video he's talking about here.) As for the groping comments: ""Well, it's not right, but he didn't mean it for an open mic, and he didn't act on it. And Hillary's husband acted on it.""

Inside the event, Barb Main of Lakeland referred me to still another tape when I asked her about Trump's comments. ""I don't really like it, but it was 11 years ago,"" she said. ""He wasn’t in politics. I think what Bill and Hillary have done is worse. I've heard the tapes of her laughing about the 12-year-old that was raped by the 35-year-old guy that got off. And that's just sick. She was defending the guy that raped her—she knows he did it, and got him off with a minimal sentence and laughing about it. And the way she destroyed the women that were involved with Bill."" (Roy Reed, who was interviewing Clinton in the recording in question, has clarified that Clinton was laughing at the ""absurdity"" of the Arkansas crime laboratory, and not the case itself.)

Sue Imbody, a real estate agent, told me she shrugged at the Trump tape because as a woman who had fought to break through in an industry dominated by men, she'd heard worse. ""I've been in a lot of business transactions, and men are men,"" she said. ""And their discussions include some garbage that I would not use; sometimes it slips in my presence, but you know what, I understand that I'm not gonna change the world with my values, that if I want to participate and I want to know how it is in the real world, that I'm gonna have to get bigger than that, get beyond that, and understand the real crises we face.""

She continued, ""They’re highfliers, high rollers. They talk their language; it's a part of the good-old-boy system. I'm on the outside a lot of times, but they’re getting wiser, they’re getting more careful, and I’m all for women and so is Trump.""

A handful of people I spoke to did allow that Trump had done something undeniably wrong, but they emphasized forgiveness. ""You know what, I'm a Christian woman and of course I do agree that that kind of talk is not something that is appropriate for the mainstream media,"" Gwen Rollings told me. ""However, he's asked for forgiveness, and as Christians that's what we're supposed to do. I'm voting for his principles and his policies now.""

That same Christian charity was not available for the Republican politicians who had jumped ship over the weekend, though. ""I would probably compare them to like Benedict Arnold,"" Rollings said."

The odds that he brings up Obama’s birth certificate again despite having made a show of accepting O’s American birthplace a few weeks ago can’t be worse than 50/50. If he’s going down, he’s going down making his fans happy, playing the old hits.

Plus, it’ll be a great warm-up for Trump News next year.

“Even the polls are crooked,” he said at a Monday night rally, expressing disbelief that he is losing to Clinton in Pennsylvania. “Look, we’re in a rigged system.”…

On Tuesday when Bill O’Reilly told him that “you’re behind with women,” Trump responded, “I’m not sure I believe it. I’m not sure I believe it.”
He’s not sure he’s behind with women after he got caught talking about … grabbing women by the p***y?

Meanwhile:

The Republican presidential nominee told supporters during a rally in Ocala, Florida, that the terrorist network [ISIS] is “hoping and praying” for a Clinton presidency.

“Because they’ll take over not only that part of the world, they’ll take over this country, they’ll take over this part of the world,” Trump said. “Believe me. They are hoping. They are hoping.”
I would have stuck with the Supreme Court as my go-to “Clinton apocalypse scenario” anecdote since it has the virtue of being true, but it’s perfectly defensible of him to say that she’d be better for ISIS. Not only is turnabout fair play, she’s the more eager interventionist of the two — and jihadis love turning American interventions into training/propaganda opportunities. Claiming that ISIS might take over this part of the world is, shall we say, not as defensible, especially at a moment when they’re losing the territory they already have. But if he’s looking for an argument that electing Hillary would mean the literal end of the United States, why not follow the lead of his buddies in the Kremlin by warning that Russia will nuke us during Clinton’s presidency? Putin’s already tried gaming the election through less belligerent means, like hacking. Now, with Trump’s situation desperate, he might as well move to overt threats.

Here he is today wondering what sort of “sinister deal” might have been struck between Paul Ryan and Hillary to inspire such disloyalty by Ryan towards his own nominee. He promises to figure it out. Odds that “globalism” factors into it: High. The second clip is Obama goofing on an Alex Jones soundbite this week in which Jones suggested he and Clinton might be actual demons. Maybe that’s what the final week of the campaign will be spent on."
100545,1006,New Trump ad hits Hillary over “Corruption”,http://hotair.com/archives/2016/10/12/new-trump-ad-hits-hillary-corruption/,20,"The shackles are off, Donald Trump promised earlier this week, but … why were these shackles on before now? For months, we have waited for Team Trump to start airing ads about the corruption between the Clinton Foundation and the State Department. In two debates, we waited in vain for Trump to hit Hillary Clinton over the Uranium One deal and the $57.5 million in personal income she and Bill took in while she served as Secretary of State. Both the debate moderators and Hillary herself gave Trump plenty of openings for such attacks — especially when Hillary attacked Trump’s alleged Russian business interests, which would have been a slam dunk segue to Uranium One and Bill Clinton’s $500,000 payoff from the Russian oligarchs involved. Instead, Trump took a pass … and we waited.

Wait no longer. With less than four weeks to go, Team Trump has finally pivoted to “Corruption” (via The Hill): “The Clintons: from dead broke to worth hundreds of millions,” the video’s narrator says.

“So how did Hillary end up filthy rich? Pay to play politics.”

The ad goes on to accuse Clinton’s family foundation of accepting money from “criminals, dictators [and] countries that hate America.

It rehashes some of the more biting accusations against the foundation, that it “exploited Haitians in need” and turned over “American uranium rights” to a Russian company whose backers included foundation donors.
“Rehashes” isn’t the correct word. One has to have “hashed” in the first place in order to “rehash.”

The ad itself is direct and effective, and should score some points. The question, though, is why the Trump campaign didn’t have this ad ready in the first week of August, and why they have spent their time attacking Hillary on any other basis since. All of these issues were well known at that point, and could have helped define this race more as a fight against entrenched interests and corruption. Instead, Trump has wasted two months of opportunities to get specific on these points.

Better late than never, one supposes, but there is such a thing in politics as too late."
100546,1006,Report: Clinton Foundation donors got rich off Haiti relief efforts while Haitians live in squalor,http://hotair.com/archives/2016/10/12/report-clinton-foundation-donors-got-rich-haiti-relief-efforts-haitians-live-squalor/,20,"ABC News investigative reporter Brian Ross has shepherded a detailed analysis of the tangled web of public and private aid relief after the 2010 earthquake in Haiti with the Clinton Foundation (and Hillary Clinton’s State Department) at the center of the complicated network:

Bill and Hillary Clinton have hailed the factory churning out Old Navy sweatshirts in an industrial park here as a shining achievement in their efforts to rebuild this island nation after a destructive earthquake in 2010.

But the garment factory has under-delivered on projected jobs. Haitian workers have accused managers of bullying and sexual harassment. And an ABC News investigation has found that after opening its factory in the Haitian industrial park — built with $400 million of global aid — the Korean firm became a Clinton Foundation donor and its owner invested in a startup company owned by Hillary Clinton’s former chief of staff.
You should read the entire post as there are details that will blow your mind, like the Team Clinton’s focus on getting a luxury Marriott Hotel built in Haiti while hundreds of Haitians continue to live in squalor:

But in Port-au-Prince, where neighborhoods still teem with flimsy lean-tos and tarp-covered shacks, residents told ABC News they harbor frustrations with the way the Clintons marshaled international aid.

“I didn’t get any of the money,” said Inèse Luma, who lives crammed with five relatives in a makeshift home of tarp, wood and plastic. “I don’t think I’m ever going to have a permanent house.”

Efforts to rebuild the thousands of homes destroyed by the 7.0 quake have inched forward. In six years, USAID says, it has constructed fewer than 1,500 homes, and many of those have had to be rebuilt because of poor workmanship.

At the same time, the Clinton Foundation says it “facilitated” the construction of a luxury hotel in Port-au-Prince, a Marriott owned by Denis O’Brien, who has given $10 million to $25 million to the Clinton Foundation. O’Brien, an Irish billionaire who runs the Jamaica-based telecom giant Digicel, said he financed the hotel himself.
Make no mistake, many of the projects were financed through international aid organizations funded by various world governments led by the United States. And, as it turns out, many of the corporations receiving the largest amount of financial aid and incentive from these government-funded agencies were also big donors to the Clinton Foundation.

The modern industrial park, with wide, clear roads connecting rows of low-slung warehouses, would be paid for by the Inter-American Development Bank, which provided $256.8 million in grants to support construction. The bank has donated $1 million to $5 million to the Clinton Foundation, according to its website. Large American retailers, including Wal-Mart and Gap Inc., have served as buyers for the clothes shipped from Haiti to the U.S. with special U.S. tax breaks. Wal-Mart has given $1 million to $5 million, and Gap has given $100,000 to $250,000 to the foundation. And in 2012, SAE-A, the Korean garment company that was recruited to become the anchor tenant of the park, gave $50,000 to $100,000 to the foundation.
And no story about corruption in the Clinton State Department would be complete without Cheryl Mills making an appearance:

Two years after the factory was operational, Mills had left the State Department. She turned up, according to an online press release, at a Sae-A company event in Costa Rica. She appeared there, the release said, on behalf of her privately owned international development firm, Black Ivy Group. “Ms. Mills was invited and came to the event as a guest, as did many others,” Garwood said, in response to questions from ABC News.

The chairman of SAE-A, Woong-ki Kim, was identified on the Black Ivy website as one of the initial investors in the firm. That page has since been taken down. “The chairman’s investment in Black Ivy was a personal investment that was not made until late in 2014,” Garwood said. “As a policy, the chairman does not discuss his personal investments.”

Black Ivy Group is described on its website as a firm that “builds and grows commercial enterprises in sub-Saharan Africa” and focuses on “building and leveraging a vast network of global and local relationships spanning the public, private and government sectors.” Mills’ partner in the venture, Jean-Louis Warnholz, worked on the Caracol project in Haiti while serving as a senior State Department adviser to Hillary Clinton.
This exposé coupled with yesterday’s email dump that revealed State Department employees screening out Haitian relief efforts in the category of Clinton VIPs and the lowly, non-FOB rabble should draw more attention to the corrupt breakdown of the supposed “wall” between State Department operations and the Clinton Foundation during Hillary’s tenure.

Should. That is, if anyone cares to stop talking about Donald Trump’s lust for hot Hollywood starlets 11 years ago."

It started with the leaked audio tape that NBC held onto for 11 years and purposely waited for the perfect time to release and cause the most amount of damage possible.

Now, the New York Times is running a story claiming that two women have come forward with allegations of sexual assault against Trump.

Here is what they said… The Trump team wasted no time responding. From The New York Times:

In a phone interview on Tuesday night, a highly agitated Mr. Trump denied every one of the women’s claims.


“None of this ever took place,” said Mr. Trump, who began shouting at The Times reporter who was questioning him. He said that The Times was making up the allegations to hurt him and that he would sue the news organization if it reported them.

“You are a disgusting human being,” he told the reporter as she questioned him about the women’s claims.

Asked whether he had ever done any of the kissing or groping that he had described on the recording, Mr. Trump was once again insistent: “I don’t do it. I don’t do it. It was locker room talk.”

Interesting how you can hear the animosity toward Trump in the words the New York Times chose.

“Agitated” “Shouting”

Like Hillary once said, before retracting, every woman deserves to be believed.

However, it is no secret that the media has been incredibly dishonest in their coverage of Donald Trump.

What do you think about this allegation?

The media likes to pretend they are outraged about the leaked Donald Trump tape where he said rude things but they aren’t concerned that Hillary’s husband actually did bad things.

Bill Clinton was asked about the women being at the debate and about the press conference they held right before the debate.

Here is what he had to say. Welp. There you have it.

Bill is totally ignoring the serious allegations against him just like the media is.

The guy is a skilled politician no doubt.

But it is shameful that Hillary can pretend she is a champion for women and then completely ignore the awful things her husband is connected to.

This kind of thing only helps the Trump campaign.

You know he is going to keep hammering away at this issue.

And he should.

100549,1007,WikiLeaks: Hillary Clinton Read Script Word For Word During Interview With MSNBC,http://www.youngcons.com/hillary-read-script-word-for-word-during-interview-with-msnbc/,20,"The WikiLeaks revelations that have been slowly trickling out this week have been absolutely devastating to Hillary Clinton.

The mainstream media isn’t covering it of course, but they have been implicated as being totally in the tank for her so that’s not surprising.

Hillary Clinton is one of the worst politicians you will ever see.

She’s simply really bad at it.

Which is why the latest WikiLeaks email that shows she read a script word for word during an interview makes a lot of sense.

From The Daily Caller: Newly leaked emails reveal that Hillary Clinton read from a script word-for-word during a phone interview with Chris Hayes on MSNBC.

The emails, hacked from the campaign chairman John Podesta’s Gmail account and published by WikiLeaks Wednesday, reveal an exchange between him and Dan Schwerin — her speechwriter — where they reviewed her scripted response to a question about tax hikes on “All In With Chris Hayes.” That’s the candidate that is exciting Democrats huh?


Someone who can’t even handle an interview with a liberal network without reading from a piece of paper?

What a disaster."
100550,1008,"Trump, Morality, and Reason",http://www.americanthinker.com/articles/2016/10/trump_morality_and_reason.html,20,"It’s important to remember that a lot of Donald Trump’s supporters are so stubbornly loyal to him because he has the right enemies.

How, some wonder, can decent people, including Evangelical Christians, continue to support Donald Trump after (for example) the tape of him bragging about his sexual aggression and attempted adultery has come to light? The answer isn’t that they aren’t offended; it’s that it’s hard to get on board with a cultural consensus that doesn’t consider supporting partial birth abortion or blasphemy to be offensive, but gets righteously indignant over some coarse remarks from a candidate they don’t like.  When vapid, overpaid Hollywood stars condemn Trump for being obscene and immoral -- well, let’s just say that Trump may be a wolf in sheep’s clothing, but we surely won’t be persuaded by that by a chorus of boys who are always crying wolf.

But should conservatives continue to support Trump? I’ve written before about how Trump seems to have basically conservative intuitions, and made the case that, based on his record, we can expect that he will appoint and listen to people more competent than himself if ever he became POTUS.  But there is another angle we have to consider: Does there come a point where a candidate who may be on the right side of a lot of issues -- maybe even the most important issues -- is too morally compromised to prudently support?

Take Senator Joseph McCarthy.  Today, he is only remembered as a villain, a paranoiac whose Inquisitions brought shame on the nation, a lunatic who wasted time persecuting poor, innocent individuals based on an imagined threat.  The truth, of course, is that the Soviet Union, despite what the intellectuals were claiming, was a horrific nightmare empire that did have spies in the United States (as was proven by the Venona Project), and, in point of fact, McCarthy correctly identified a few of them. He was, in other words, broadly right, and his instincts were far more correct than the dangerous “Useful Idiots” who defended the Communist regime.  The very fact that those sorts of people were so opposed to McCarthy was precisely what made him so appealing to some; it is not unimportant that William F. Buckley Jr. and his brother-in-law titled their book defending his crusade McCarthy and His Enemies.

But, for all that, McCarthy did go too far; he did penalize and persecute innocent people.  Many, including Buckley himself, would later say that the worst injury McCarthy dealt to America was the fact that his excesses had discredited the legitimate and necessary work of anti-Communism and of routing out Soviet spies.

This is the important question conservatives deliberating about whether to support Trump need to take into account.  The issue is not necessarily whether Trump himself is personally immoral.  Part of the reason why so many governors in the early Church put off baptism until the end of their lives (such as the great Emperor Constantine himself, venerated as a saint in the East) was because of the idea that being a ruler and being holy were almost mutually exclusive. (There are, of course, politicians who managed to be saints, such as Thomas Beckett, Thomas More, and Gabriel García Moreno; but remember that all of them ended up being killed in office as a result.)  And history seems to bear witness that someone can be a personal moral disaster and still be a competent national leader.

But it is legitimate to ask whether a leader’s moral flaws are such that they do impede his ability to govern effectively.  One thinks of a scene in Macbeth: Macduff has come to Malcolm, the legitimate heir to the throne, seeking to install him out a burning desire for revenge (Macbeth having had Macduff’s family killed by this point).  Malcolm decides to test Macduff first: He claims to be a moral wreck himself, ridden by avarice, intemperance, and lust; he claims to be a greedy sexual predator, in other words.  If Macduff were driven merely by vengeance rather than a desire for justice for Scotland, this probably would not deter him; he would have supported Macduff anyways (an “anybody but Macbeth!” policy, if you will).  Instead, this news devastates him, because it means that the only alternative to Macbeth is not “fit to govern.”  Macduff passes the test; he values the welfare of his motherland over his hatred for the tyranny of Macbeth, and only now does Malcolm reveal that he is, in fact, a holy and virtuous man, eminently suited to regain the throne.  The implication is clear: even if Malcolm were the rightful heir, his claim would not be worth defending if he were not morally worthy of it. Perhaps this same rationale is why Blessed Pope Innocent IX seems to have quietly supported the Protestant William of Orange over against the Catholic King James and his dynasty; the Jacobites may have defended the right civilization, but their monarch wasn’t the right man for the job.

Conservatives are the sort of people who should be especially shrewd about this sort of thing; they should be uniquely skeptical of those who seek to obtain power, especially veteran salespeople.  The Southern Agrarians were writers who defended the conservative, aristocratic civilization of the Old South against the liberalizing ravages of Northern capitalism (Southern authors like Flannery O’Connor and Walker Percy have always been among the most insightful about the country’s spiritual condition), yet it was one of those very Agrarians, Robert Penn Warren, who recognized that a candidate like Huey Long -- who, like them, and like Trump, was standing athwart globalizing influences and the tyranny of crony capitalism -- was really undone by his own personal ambitiousness and moral blind spots, famously depicted in his novel All the King’s Men.

Interestingly, both McCarthy and Long’s primary supporters and advisers were priests: McCarthy was inspired by Father Edmund Walsh of Georgetown, while Long was empowered by radio host Father Charles Coughlin, whose quasi-fascist views were aired in his magazine Social Justice (we should never forget that one of the first movements to describe itself as driven by “social justice” was anti-Semitic and fascistic).  Both were intelligent men who valued Christian virtue, but perhaps made the decision that these politicians’ charisma and drive on behalf of a good cause would outweigh their personal moral shortcomings.  Both priests made a wrong calculation. 

The philosophical tradition of justice always recognized that passion needs to be controlled by reason, both in an individual and in the state; unchecked sexual desire or covetousness for money, power, or even simple attention impair reason’s ability to function properly. Certainly, as conservative as Trump’s general intuitions may be, he often seems a bit fuzzy and inconsistent on how to implement those instincts consistently (as opposed to candidates like “Average” Joe Schriner or the American Solidarity Party, which strive to be rigorously consistent with the traditions of political virtue), and this may be because he has not subjugated his passions. If his civilizational reforms are as important as his supporters think they are, they have to be extremely honest with themselves about his personal ability to deliver on them.

This long view is the beginning of political wisdom.

100551,1008,Will Old Political Formulas Finally Apply to Trump?,http://www.americanthinker.com/articles/2016/10/will_old_political_formulas_finally_apply_to_trump.html,20,"“Trump’s a goner,” said friends of mine in Washington DC, in the aftermath of the surfacing of the old tape of him talking salty like a sailor, and before Sunday night’s debate. Friends who are pretty good at politics and who’ve generally been fair in their estimations of Trump. But, hey, even these folk breathe the air Inside-the-Beltway, so they’re susceptible to the oppressive groupthink and industry town-driven agendas that are DC.

Outside the Beltway is another matter. The old Trump tape is off-putting, but it making Trump a “goner” isn’t what’s on people’s minds. Yeah, this is anecdotal. The polling has yet to capture public sentiment adequately. But the betting is Trump’s potty mouth moment strikes him only temporarily. More tapes surfacing? You get shock value once -- unless what the anti-Trump cadre offers next can top the first significantly. Doubtful. But they can always lie (more on that anon). 

Voters are given short shrift. To many DC pros, they’re statistics and focus groups, but not real people with real lives weighing real candidates and real situations… considering how elections impact their lives and families.

Here I speak of undecided voters -- independents who are watching and weighing Trump and Hillary. In context, and with perspective, what did Trump say in that tape that undecided voters would believe is outside Trump’s character? Hmm? A celebrity since the 80s, a reality TV star, a man with a taste for the flamboyant, a guy who’s mutli-married and made the gossip columns about who’s on his arm at this or that event.

If Mike Pence had let fly the locker-room language about a woman, then the Trump ticket would have a big problem. Pence, an evangelical Christian, who walks the straight and narrow and professes his faith. That’s not who Trump is; that’s not the public perception of Trump. The Trump tape is a “scandal” without legs, much to the dismay of scheming DC Republicans and perpetually power-lusting Democrats.  

God acts in mysterious ways, goes the saying. Trump’s enemies surfaced a tape for two key reasons. First, to distract from the WikiLeaks dump that outed Hillary as a Wall Street ally, a cynic and phony on her public bashing of New York’s rich and powerful moneychangers. Second, to level the playing field. Trump’s enemies see the internal numbers: Hillary and Bill are moral and legal disasters. Undecideds know it, are troubled by it, and are reluctant to screen-touch for Hillary.

What the Trump tape provides is an unexpectedly useful contrast for voters sitting on the fence. Wonder they: “Whose offenses are greater, Trump’s mouth about women or Hillary’s and Bill’s decades-long actions concerning women?” With about four weeks of election campaigning remaining, the sink-in will not flatter or favor Hillary, who is chronically distrusted, even among rank and file Democrats.  

With Bill, there’s a credible allegation of rape (Juanita Broaddrick), sexual assault (Kathleen Willey), sexual exploits with a White House employee (Monica Lewinsky), and the president’s ensuing perjury about said affair and impeachment. Then there’s decades of affairs by Bubba.

The pièce de résistance is the long-surfaced role Hillary played managing the stifling of these “bimbo eruptions.” Hillary, the champion of women and girls everywhere, touting the compassion and justice of The Village. Imagine that, bimbo eruption manager Hillary regarding rape and sexual assault no differently (though with more urgency and applied pressure) than Bill’s too numerous to detail trailer park hookups.

The choice for voters is stark. The sink-in has already begun. Hillary is on the wrong side of the equation. But caution’s in order. If the old Trump tape (and any others) fail to waylay him, expect a desperate Hillary and equally desperate Democrats to outright lie about Trump’s dealings with women.       

From the launch of Trump’s presidential bid, the conventional wisdom had Trump marked as a sideshow attraction -- a little color and flare among the typically button-downed lineup of GOP presidential wannabes. Good for a few chuckles, that Trump, but let’s get serious.

How wrong the experts have been about Trump, whose issues resonated powerfully, whose blunt messaging was like fresh air, and whose bare-knuckled fighting cleared a crowded GOP field. Trump made the GOP’s practiced pols and high-priced experts look bad -- very bad -- and that doesn’t sit well with men and women who’ve staked their existences on being right about politics. Careers, power, and paychecks are on the line, and those folk want no disruptions, no threats to their ways of life.

The Democrats want to retain the White House so badly they’ve willingly invested in two old, wheezing warhorses -- Bill and Hill -- who’ve alternately been advantages and deadweight to the Democrats. On average, though, Democrats see the Clintons as pluses. Hubris is at work among the Democrats this time.

Think Democrats: “Slick Willy and Hillary have slipped out of so many legal and ethical controversies that -- forget Teflon coating -- they’re titanium-plated, nearly impervious to consequences for their unending moral lapses and criminality. The MSM has them covered, anyway. We’re sharp operators, too. We’re riding them one more go, because we can’t afford to have Obama’s advances lost. We’re just inches away from taking the courts and controlling the nation for a generation or more.”

Trump is no accident, as establishment Republicans hope. He didn’t make the movement that’s roiling the GOP and sending shockwaves through the nation’s establishments now; he gave it a face and a voice. He’s a great disrupter at a time when the nation’s conventional politics are collapsing. Say voters, lopsidedly: the nation is on the wrong track. Politicians and Washington government can’t be trusted. The future looks darker for us, our kids, and grandkids.

Shortly after the old tape emerged, Trump manned up, apologizing. Note the contrast with Bill Clinton, who made his apology about lying about the Monica Lewinsky affair. Hillary has never apologized for her role in strong-arming or trashing many, many of Bill’s women who were potential liabilities.

Trump got off the canvass after the first debate and tape release to smartly best Hillary in Sunday night’s debate. The prediction here is that debate will not only stop any bleeding that Trump had from the tape, but as undecided voters reflect in the coming days, convict Hillary with a powerful clarity in their minds. That will take time to reflect in the polling.

Expect the next four weeks of this most historical presidential contest to be hell on earth, politically. Is Trump elected president on the first Tuesday in November? I’ll venture, “Yes,” though expect it to be a close-run affair. Critical turns in history often hinge on a series of factors that only matter when taken in sum later.

But Donald Trump continues to upset the conventional wisdom. He’s far outperformed the establishment’s clichéd expectations. He may well do that again on November 8.

100552,1008,The Man Who Taught Hillary How to Shred Haunts Wikileaks Dump,http://www.americanthinker.com/articles/2016/10/the_man_who_taught_hillary_how_to_shred_haunts_wikileaks_dump.html,20,"“Before I begin,” Hillary Clinton told an audience at the Brookings Institute in December 2015, “I want to acknowledge the loss of a beloved member of our foreign policy family, Sandy Berger.”

In fact, Berger appears repeatedly in the Wikileaks dump of emails from and to John Podesta, chairman of Hillary Clinton’s campaign. In reading through them, one gets the impression that if Berger was not an architect of the Iranian nuclear deal, he was at least a major salesman.

Hillary had good cause to praise Berger. In the run-up to the 2004 9/11 hearings, Berger taught Hillary by example that, if you were a prominent Democrat, it was possible to destroy damaging classified information and get away with it.

Like Pulp Fiction’s Winston Wolf, Berger’s job in the Clinton White House was to “solve problems.” In his first term, Clinton named Berger the deputy national security advisor job and promoted him to national security advisor in the second.

Unlike virtually all of his predecessors -- Colin Powell, Zbigniew Brzezinski, Henry Kissinger -- Berger, a trade lawyer and lobbyist, had no foreign policy expertise. What he did have was the president’s confidence. Clinton had entrusted the then deputy with some highly sensitive assignments, most notably the astonishingly corrupt deals with China, and Berger delivered.

In April 2002, the former president called in his chits. He designated Berger as his representative to review intelligence documents in advance of the various hearings on 9/11. As a 2007 report by the House Committee on Government Oversight and Reform specified, Berger did not welcome this assignment.

According to the archivists, Berger “indicated some disgust with the burden and responsibility of conducting the document review.” It was hard to blame him. To purge the archives of incriminating documents, Berger risked everything -- his reputation, his livelihood, his very freedom.

According to the House report, Berger made four trips to the National Archives. The first of his visits was in May 2002, the last in October 2003. He clearly left his mark. “The full extent of Berger’s document removal,” said the House report, “is not known and never can be known.”

On his first day in the archives, according to archives staff, “Had Berger seen ‘a smoking gun’ or other documents he did not want brought to an investigatory panel’s attention, he could have removed it on this visit.”

Unlike so many career bureaucrats, Paul Brachfeld, the inspector general of the National Archives, spoke out forcefully about the criminal activity he was witnessing. Unfortunately, Brachfeld met resistance from career bureaucrats more powerful than he. On January 14, 2004, the day Berger first testified privately before the 9/11 Commission, Brachfeld conferred with DOJ attorney Howard Sklamberg.

Concerned that Berger had obstructed the 9/11 Commission’s work, Brachfeld wanted assurance that the commission knew of Berger’s crime. He did not get it. On March 22, 2004, two days before Berger’s public testimony, senior attorneys John Dion and Bruce Swartz informed Brachfeld the DOJ was not going to notify the 9/11 Commission of the Berger investigation before his appearance.

DOJ’s failure to notify the commission set up one of the most bizarre days in the annals of American history -- Wednesday, March 24, 2004. Berger had already been apprehended stealing and destroying documents that the commission was expected to review. The commission members, at least the Republicans, did not know this. This much was evident in Chairman Thomas Kean’s initial exchange with Berger.

“We are pleased to welcome before the commission a witness who can offer us considerable insight into questions of national policy coordination, Mr. Samuel Berger,” said Kean. To those in the know what Kean asked next must have sounded like a punch line: “Mr. Berger, we would like to ask you to raise your right hand. Do you swear or affirm to tell the truth, the whole truth and nothing but the truth?”

On April 6, 2004, two weeks after Berger’s appearance before the 9/11 Commission, Brachfeld called DOJ’s Inspector General Glenn Fine and again expressed his concern that the commissioners remained unaware of Berger’s theft.

Fine organized a meeting for April 9. Brachfeld reported to those gathered, “Berger knowingly removed documents and therefore, may have purposely impeded the 9/11 investigation.” Some of those documents, Brachfeld added, might have been “original.”

For all of his efforts, Brachfeld was unable to persuade the DOJ to inform the 9/11 Commission of Berger’s actions. The commissioners remained in the dark until July 19, 2004, three days before the 9/11 Commission released its final report, too late for any significant amendment.

They might not have known even then had there not been a leak from somewhere in the Bush administration. At the time this story broke in July 2004, Berger was serving as a campaign advisor to Senator John Kerry.

“Last year, when I was in the archives reviewing documents, I made an honest mistake,” he lied to reporters. A year later, when Berger pled guilty, the Times wrote off the theft and the surrounding hoopla as “a brief stir” in the campaign season.

In truth, Berger’s actions were no more honest than Hillary Clinton’s a decade later. Among his more flagrantly criminal acts, Berger swiped highly classified documents, and then, during a break, stashed them under a trailer at a construction site. He retrieved them at the end of the day and admittedly used scissors to cut the documents into little pieces before throwing them away.

These repeated thefts should have caused a whole lot more than a brief stir. “His motives in taking the documents remain something of a mystery,” reported the New York Times after Berger pled guilty. How different history would have been had the Washington Post contented itself with writing, “The motives of the Watergate burglars remain something of a mystery.”

Finally, on Friday, April 1, 2005, the Bush Department of Justice announced its plea deal with Berger, an embarrassingly lenient one at that -- a $10,000 fine and the loss of his top-level security clearance for three years, just in time for him to advise Barack Obama starting in 2008.

With John Ashcroft gone, it seems that the Bush White House lost control of its own Justice Department. For the record, Dion, Swartz, Sklamberg, and Fine were all holdovers from the Clinton administration. As far as I can tell, Fine, Swartz, and Sklamberg have only contributed to Democratic candidates in federal races and Dion has no record of federal contributions.

Less than a year later, Berger was back in the news. The global strategy firm over which he presided, Stonebridge International, added a new member to its advisory board. That member just happened to be the vice-chair of the 9/11 Commission, Lee Hamilton, a former congressman.

“A friend and counselor to me and to many of us, Sandy was a wise and brilliant man,” said Hillary of her departed consigliere, the man who risked his all to preserve the Clinton legacy.

On a personal note, after writing this, I have to ask, “Are there really Republicans willing to let these people back into the White House?” By the way, Tom Kean is one of them.

100553,1009,THE CLINTONISTAS CONTEMPT FOR AMERICANS RUNS DEEP,http://www.powerlineblog.com/archives/2016/10/the-clintonistas-contempt-for-americans-runs-deep.php,20,"During the two presidential debates (or should I say debates between presidential candidates?) Hillary Clinton has lambasted Donald Trump for attacking women, Hispanics, African-Americans, Muslim-Americans and the disabled. Trump has, indeed, attacked members of these groups, sometimes in disgusting ways. However, his attacks have not been categorical ones directed at entire classes of Americans.

By contrast, Hillary Clinton and her close advisers have attacked broad swathes of the American population in categorical terms. Hillary sees about 20 percent of the populations as deplorables who are beyond redemption.

Meanwhile, as John has noted, Clinton’s communications director Jennifer Palmieri has attacked Catholics, other than those who decline to follow core Church doctrines, and evangelicals. The attacks appear in emails divulged by Wikileaks.

The best Palmieri could come up with when asked about the emails was this non-denial denial: “I don’t recognize that email that we saw.” But those of us who have listened to a certain kind of liberal speak in private about conservative Catholics and evangelicals will recognize the bigoted content of emails as well as the narrow-mindedness, ignorance, condescension, and arrogance they express.

Finally, let’s not forget that Huma Abedin, perhaps the closest Clinton adviser of them all, has expressed her contempt for American Jews. In a leaked email, she urged that Bill Clinton reject an invitation to speak before the American Israel Public Affairs Council (AIPAC), saying “u really want to consider sending him into that crowd?” (Emphasis added)

AIPAC is a bipartisan, mainstream American Jewish organization that has always warmly greeted both Bill and Hillary Clinton. Members of “that crowd,” as Abedin derisively called it, are defined by (1) being American Jews and (2) supporting Israel. This was enough to cause Abedin to insult them and argue that Bill Clinton ought not appear before them.

When you add to the “deplorables” those conservative Catholics, evangelicals, and American Jewish supporters of Israel who aren’t per se deplorable in Hillary’s view, you are probably talking about 30 to 40 percent of the American public. Such is the magnitude of Clintonista antipathy towards Americans. Indeed, I would submit, it’s the magnitude of left-liberal antipathy.

Does Trumpism reach that level of antipathy? I doubt it."
100554,1009,MORE WIKILEAKS PAYDIRT: DEMOCRATS HATE AMERICA,http://www.powerlineblog.com/archives/2016/10/more-wikileaks-paydirt-democrats-hate-america.php,20,"I wish I had time thoroughly to go through the trove of John Podesta emails released by Wikileaks, but just a few I’ve seen reveal the deep disdain by which liberals regard the American people, American traditions and institutions. Everyone recalls how Hillary had to backtrack quickly from her remark that half of Trump’s supporters are “deplorables” and “irredeemable” (though her apology only really regretted saying “half”). The Podesta emails show that this “slip” probably represents her true feelings.

One of the Podesta emails that has received a lot of attention reads: “I know she [Hillary] has begun to hate everyday Americans, but I think we should use it once the first time she says I’m running for president because you and everyday Americans need a champion.”

This reads pretty badly, but as has been pointed out, Podesta meant the campaign slogan “everyday Americans”—not that Hillary actually hates middle class Americans. To be clear the slogan ought to be set off in quotation marks—“everyday Americans”—and like mics on Access Hollywood buses, you should always assume these days that your emails might be read by the public some day, so pay attention to punctuation and language.

Of course, the alternate explanation is that this was the kind of “slip” that reflects reality?

One that is less easily explained as sloppy wording or missing punctuation is a March 2015 email from Bill Ivey to Podesta that includes the following passage:

And as I’ve mentioned, we’ve all been quite content to demean government, drop civics and in general conspire to produce an unaware and compliant citizenry. The unawareness remains strong but compliance is obviously fading rapidly.

It’s hard to put a generous construction on this passage, which seems to admit that liberalism depends on the ignorance of citizens for them to be “compliant,” but darn these dumb Americans, they just don’t want to behave.

Even more outrageous is the email from Sandy Newman, identified as the president of “Voices for Progress,” that demands Roman Catholics give up their beliefs and just become liberal Democrats. John has already noted their disdain for “Thomism” in the following post, but this one is even worse:

There needs to be a Catholic Spring, in which Catholics themselves demand the end of a middle ages dictatorship and the beginning of a little democracy and respect for gender equality in the Catholic church. Is contraceptive coverage an issue around which that could happen. . . Even if the idea isn’t crazy, I don’t qualify to be involved and I have not thought at all about how one would “plant the seeds of the revolution,” or who would plant them. Just wondering . . .

Podesta offers this chilling response: “We created Catholics in Alliance for the Common Good to organize for a moment like this.”

There you have it folks, today’s Democratic Party and their respect for “diversity.” Here they admit a deliberate intent to interfere with a private religious institution because it doesn’t conform to the dictates of liberal identity politics."
100555,1009,TWO WOMEN EMERGE TO ACCUSE TRUMP OF UNWANTED TOUCHINGS,http://www.powerlineblog.com/archives/2016/10/two-women-emerge-to-accuse-trump-of-unwanted-touchings.php,20,"During his second debate with Hillary Clinton, Donald Trump denied having ever engaged in the sexual assaults he boasted about in the Access Hollywood tape. I had understood that the debate would consist of the candidates answering questions from members of the “town hall.” But Anderson Cooper decided to take over the questioning so he could press Trump about whether his boasts were true. Initially, Trump avoided that question, but eventually said they were not true. I transcribed the exchange here.

Now, two women tell the New York Times that Trump did engage in unwanted advances. The alleged advances consisted of groping (in the case of Jessica Leeds) and kissing (in the case of Rachel Crooks).

The claims may well be true. They are consistent with Trump’s boasts. To me, they seem consistent with his “take whatever I want” character.

Nor do Trump’s denials count for much. He continues to deny saying, pre-invasion, that he supported the war in Iraq even though there’s tape of him expressing support (albeit mild) for the war. Like his opponent in this race, Trump has displayed scant regard for the truth.

Nonetheless, there is reason to doubt the claims of Ms. Leeds and Ms. Crooks. Why are we hearing about them only now? It’s not so much that the alleged victims did not publicly complain at the time of Trump’s alleged advances. In the case of Ms. Crooks, at least, not publicly complaining was reasonable considering her age (22), Trump’s power, and the fact that she worked at Trump Tower.

More significant is that fact that neither woman came forward publicly until about a year after Trump emerged as the Republican frontrunner. Why didn’t they? If Trump had behaved so egregiously, one would expect them to do their best to nip his candidacy in the bud.

I’m skeptical about Ms. Leeds’ claim that she came forward publicly only now because she became enraged by Trump’s denial during Sunday’s debate of misconduct. If Trump did to her what she claims, she must have been enraged all along by the thought that he might become U.S. president — something that was a very realistic possibility until quite recently.

Leeds, it seems to me, is being used by the Clinton campaign as part of a well-orchestrated, well-timed effort to portray Trump as a predator. Same with Crooks. It’s a classic ambush — an October surprise.

If, as I believe, these women are collaborating with the Clinton campaign as to the timing of their allegations, they may also be collaborating as to the content. In other words, there is reason to question their credibility.

This doesn’t mean their allegations are false. I wouldn’t be surprised if they are true. But I am not going to have my voting decision influenced by allegations that seem more designed to help Hillary Clinton, whom both women say they support, than to enlighten the public about the real Donald Trump."
100556,1010,Mormons are embarrassing the rest of the Religious Right by abandoning Trump,https://thinkprogress.org/mormons-embarrass-religious-right-a84f0fd78b85#.xh3clmi5c,20,"Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump’s campaign tumbled into a tailspin this past weekend after the Washington Post released a video in which he gloated about sexually assaulting women. Within hours, former supporters of the businessman began to distance themselves from his candidacy, resulting in an avalanche of un-endorsements that ultimately left one-third of all Republican senators unwilling to back him.
As several commentators and reporters were quick to note, however, many evangelical Christian members of the Religious Right_—_who have long claimed to be the arbiters of “family values”_—_refused to abandon the Donald. Some condemned his comments, but leaders such as Ralph Reed (head of Trump’s advisory board and the Faith and Freedom Coalition) and Jerry Falwell, Jr (president of the evangelical Christian college Liberty University) argued that right-wing faithful still had an obligation to vote for Trump, if for no other reason than to guarantee the placement of conservative justices on the Supreme Court. Their dedication drew harsh criticism from faith leaders on both sides of the political and theological aisles, many of whom argued that continued support for Trump amounted to collective abandonment of principle on the part of the conservative faithful.
Except, of course, for one very particular subset of the conservative faith coalition: Mormons.
“It is not acceptable to ask a moral, dignified man to cast his vote to help elect an immoral man who is absent decency or dignity.”
Republican members of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints (LDS) were already disproportionately represented among the GOP’s anti-Trump crowd, but they were also among the first to bail on the candidate after news broke of the tapes. Rep. Jason Chaffetz was one of three Mormon representatives from Utah who either disavowed or un-endorsed Trump, saying his comments were ”abhorrent and inexcusable” before adding, “I’m out.” Utah Gov. Gary Herbert, who had not endorsed Trump so much as admitted he would vote for him, fully backed away mere hours after the news broke, tweeting, “While I cannot vote for Hillary Clinton, I will not vote for Trump.” And perhaps the most unexpected condemnation came from Glenn Beck, a famously conservative talk-show host_—_and Mormon_—_who announced that electing Hillary Clinton could be the result of “moral, ethical choice” made by conservatives who stand against Trump. “It is not acceptable to ask a moral, dignified man to cast his vote to help elect an immoral man who is absent decency or dignity,” Beck wrote in a Facebook post. “If the consequence of standing against Trump and for principles is indeed the election of Hillary Clinton, so be it. At least it is a moral, ethical choice.”
Things got even weirder on Wednesday morning, when a new poll in Mormon-majority Utah revealed that Trump and Clinton are now neck-in-neck in the state claiming 26 percent of the vote each, with Evan McMullin_—_an independent candidate for president who also happens to be Mormon_—_coming in third with 22 percent. Even more shocking: the survey, which was one of the first taken since the tapes were released, reported that a majority of voters statewide_—_especially Mormons_—_believe Trump should drop out of the race. This from Mormons, the most reliably Republican major religious group in America.
The poll results were so dramatic that it left political analysts such as the Washington Post’s Philip Bump aghast.
“There’s not a lot of polling done in Utah, so it’s worth remembering that this is one poll, in isolation,” Bump said. “And that said: Dang.”
The Mormon flight from Trump is markedly distinct from the reaction of conservative Christian voters, millions of whom have thus far vowed to support the business mogul come election day. Shortly before the tapes were released, PRRI reported that 69 percent of white evangelical Protestants said they would vote for Trump. The group’s post-scandal poll, released earlier this week, showed 65 percent still said the same_—_a statistically insignificant shift that showed little, if any, actual movement.
“When you have [Trump] … [using] fear and demagoguery, tries to paint everyone as other, sees the worst in people and highlights the worst in other groups…That doesn’t mix with our worldview.”
This dichotomy isn’t entirely surprising, of course, seeing as Mormons have been expressing fervid disapproval of Trump for months, starting when the LDS church officially admonished his proposed ban on Muslim immigration in December 2015. Since then, Trump has been soundly defeated in the Utah Republican caucus, Hillary Clinton has become the first Democrat in decades (and maybe ever) to launch a robust attempt to court Mormons, and Mormon political leaders such as Mitt Romney, former senator Bob Bennett, and Utah Lt. Gov. Spencer Cox have all voiced their misgivings about the Trump movement.
The key difference between Mormons and evangelicals, it seems, is that Latter-day Saints are embracing a different standard when it comes to choosing their candidates.
For many evangelicals, the potential political gains that a political leader could bring about_—_namely, Trump appointing conservative Supreme Court justices_—_outweigh the conduct, character, and faith of a candidate. Mormons, on the other hand, appear to reflect the disposition of a Religious Right from a different age_—_one that rejected the false choice of faith-over-politics, demanding instead that a candidate express good policies and good temperament, all while rooting their decision in their faith.
“Our religion teaches that the Constitution is an inspired document,” Cox told ThinkProgress in August. “We believe that God played a role in establishing this country_—_that the Founding Fathers were inspired in what they did… So when you have [Trump] espous[ing] the opposite of that, who uses fear and demagoguery, tries to paint everyone as other, sees the worst in people and highlights the worst in other groups…That doesn’t mix with our worldview.”
Indeed, Cox’s call for a character-driven candidate sounds eerily similar to what Ralph Reed said in 1998—when decrying Bill Clinton during the Monica Lewinsky scandal.
‘’Character matters, and the American people are hungry for that message,’’ Reed said a the time, according to the New York Times. ‘’We care about the conduct of our leaders, and we will not rest until we have leaders of good moral character.’’
By contrast, the Reed of 2016 has doubled-down on his support for Trump, dismissing the tape by saying, “I think a 10-year-old tape of a private conversation with a TV talk show host ranks pretty low on their hierarchy of their concerns.”
Mormons are hardly the only religious group rejecting Trump_—_Clinton currently enjoys record-high support from Catholics, for instance, including often-conservative white Catholics. But they are certainly the closest political cousins of the evangelical conservatives, and thus have the greatest potential to shame their political brethren into reexamining how the politics match their faith.
Time will tell if the rest of the Religious Right follows their lead. "
100557,1010,Clinton proposes plan that would lift millions out of poverty,https://thinkprogress.org/clinton-expand-ctc-998b84c3392c#.gu2rkpkmo,20,"During a news cycle swirling around comments Donald Trump made describing sexual assault and the political fallout he’s now suffering, a new policy proposal that Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton put forward didn’t get much attention.
But her plan to expand a tax credit available to people with children and tweak it slightly to make it available to the poorest Americans could dramatically reduce poverty.
Clinton announced that as president she would seek to expand the Child Tax Credit, doubling the maximum a family can receive from the government from $1,000 to $2,000 for each child up to age four.
She would also expand the refundability of the credit so it kicks in at the first dollar a family earns_—_a technical way to make sure that low-income Americans who make too little to owe federal income taxes can still receive the benefit. Right now, families earning $3,000 or less don’t get the Child Tax Credit at all, while only those who make more than about $10,000 can get the full amount.
Clinton’s changes would provide big rewards for poor Americans. The Center on Budget and Policy Priorities estimates that more than 14 million families would get some increased income from Clinton’s plan. And those who would benefit the most are the people who have the least: 5.2 million people living in deep poverty, defined as earning an income below half the poverty line or about $10,000 for a family of three, would see more money.
In the end, this proposed expansion of the Child Tax Credit alone would lift 1.5 million people above the poverty line and push another 9.4 million closer to it.
The fact that her plan would greatly impact some of the most destitute is significant especially given Clinton’s role in welfare reform. In 1996, according to her own telling, she helped round up votes to pass the Personal Responsibility and Work Opportunity Reconciliation Act_—_legislation that significantly changed the country’s cash assistance welfare program and pushed many people off the rolls.
Clinton has defended that bill. But one of the important fallouts from it has been an increase in hardship among people at the very bottom. The number of families living at below half the poverty line is higher now than when welfare reform passed. Researchers have recently found that the share of people who live in extreme poverty, or survive on $2 a day per person, increased 159 percent since it passed.
Clinton’s plan, then, would be a partial response to this sharp increase in need, sending more assistance to families in deep poverty. But the Child Tax Credit is only available to families with income. Those who for whatever reason can’t find or keep a job would be left out.
Most other developed countries have universal child allowances, which give parents, no matter their circumstances, some amount of money for their children. The U.S. could do something similar to reach everyone in need, whether or not they’re employed. According to The Century Foundation, enacting a child allowance that gives parents $2,500 for each child under the age of six would lift 3.2 million children out of poverty_—_nearly double the 1.7 million currently lifted by the Child Tax Credit_—_and cost about $17.7 billion.
The more the country is willing to spend, the more poverty would come down. If the country spent $200 billion each year on child allowances, child poverty would be cut in half.
Those are big numbers, but it’s all relative. Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump has put forward a tax plan that would cost $6.2 trillion over a decade, with the largest benefits flowing overwhemingly to the country’s richest, giving the poorest fifth of the country just $120 more on average over a decade, compared to $1.5 million for the top 0.1 percent.
Clinton’s plans look like a mirror image. Hers would raise taxes on the richest fifth of Americans to pay for her priorities, including the expanded Child Tax Credit.
Clinton has laid out other ways she would seek to help low-income Americans. She has promised to increase spending on affordable housing development, double spending on Early Head Start for low-income families with young children, increase the minimum wage, guarantee paid family leave and childcare assistance, and invest in jobs."
100558,1010,Trump bragged that he walked in on naked beauty pageant contestants,https://thinkprogress.org/trump-beauty-pageants-naked-2dc4b6c6d507#.ertvjgnl8,20,"Another story of Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump publicly bragging about violating women’s privacy and bodily autonomy has emerged. Women have shared stories of being harassed by Trump in the very ways he has publicly boasted about.
On an appearance on The Howard Stern Show in 2005, published on Sunday by CNN, Trump described going backstage at the beauty pageants while the contestants were undressed. “Before a show, I’ll go backstage and everyone’s getting dressed, and everything else, and you know, no men are anywhere, and I’m allowed to go in because I’m the owner of the pageant and therefore I’m inspecting it,” he said. “You know, I’m inspecting because I want to make sure that everything is good.”
“You know, they’re standing there with no clothes. ‘Is everybody okay?’” he continued. “And you see these incredible looking women, and so, I sort of get away with things like that.”
According to interviews BuzzFeed News conducted with former Miss Teen USA contestants, Trump did just that in 1997. Four women who were competing in the pageant that year_—_including one who was 15 at the time_—_recalled that Trump walked into the dressing area while they were changing.
One of them called it “shocking” and “creepy” and said she rushed to cover herself. Another recalled that the contestants were “just scrambling to grab stuff… whatever garments they had.”
Another called it “really shocking,” saying, “We were all naked.”
“I remember putting on my dress really quick because I was like, ‘Oh my god, there’s a man in here,’” Mariah Billado, former Miss Vermont Teen USA, said.
Billado remembered Trump saying something like, “Don’t worry, ladies, I’ve seen it all before.” Another who was 17 at the time recalled that it seemed Trump felt “it was his given right… because he owned the pageant.”
“At the time, you’re a teenager, you’re intimidated_—_it’s Donald Trump, he runs the pageant,” she said.
Another former contestant has told the same story. Tasha Dixon, who competed as Miss Arizona at age 18, told CBS2 LA, “He just came strolling right in, there was no second to put a robe on or any sort of clothing or anything. Some girls were topless, other girls were naked.” She added that they were in “a very physically vulnerable position.”
“Who do you complain to? He owns the pageant,” she added. “So there’s no one to complain to, everyone there works for him.”
None of the women who talked to BuzzFeed News said Trump touched them or said anything explicit. Meanwhile, 11 other contestants didn’t remember seeing Trump walk into the dressing area. The Trump campaign has called these stories “totally false.”
But on another episode of Stern’s show, Trump also implied that he slept with contestants. When asked if he had ever had sex with a Miss Universe or Miss USA contestant, he answered, “I never comment on things like that.” Later when someone in the background said, “Give us the first letter of the country you had sex with,” Trump responded, “How many letters are there?”
It’s one of the many times where women’s accusations of experiencing inappropriate behavior from Donald Trump have been backed up by the nominee’s own words.
After the Washington Post leaked video of him describing sexually assaulting women by kissing them without permission and grabbing their genitals, saying “you can do anything” as a celebrity, he tried to dismiss the comments as “locker room banter” that doesn’t “reflect who I am.”
Yet beauty pageant contestants had already talked publicly about being kissed unwillingly by Trump. Temple Taggart, a 1997 Miss USA contestant, told the New York Times earlier this year that he introduced himself to her by kissing her directly on the lips. “I thought, ‘Oh my god, gross,’” she said. “I think there were a few other girls that he kissed on the mouth. I was like ‘Wow, that’s inappropriate.’” Another anonymous woman has said Trump also kissed her against her will.
Trump has also been accused of sexual assaulting women he worked with. Jill Harth, who worked with him on beauty pageants, filed a lawsuit alleging that he put his hands on her thighs and genitals under a table during a business meeting. Then after a meeting a year later concluded at Mar-a-Lago, she said he forced her into a bedroom and assaulted her, touching her genitals and attempting to rape her.
Beyond outright assault, Trump has also been accused of sexual harassment in workplaces other than beauty pageants. During tapings of his reality TV show The Apprentice, crew members say he would discuss which female contestants he wanted to sleep with as the cameras rolled and asked male contestants to tell him which they would sleep with.
He focused on one camerawoman in particular, making comments about her buttocks and her looks. Cast members remembered him also making a female contestant twirl in front of him so he could look at her body and asking another woman about her breast size.
Trump also faced a lawsuit brought by employees of one of his golf clubs that included accusations that he pressured managers to hire attractive women, fire overweight ones, and display the prettiest when he came to visit. “I had witnessed Donald Trump tell managers many times while he was visiting the club that restaurant hostesses were ‘not pretty enough’ and that they should be fired and replaced with more attractive women,” one woman said in a sworn declaration."
100559,1001,Cancel the last debate,http://www.dailykos.com/stories/2016/10/13/1581960/-Cancel-the-last-debate,21,"Donald Trump’s speech is playing in the background, making very clear, there is nothing to be gained from the third and final presidential debate. 

Trump has made very clear his closing pitch—insane conspiracy theory mixed with bizarre attacks on Bill Clinton.

Onstage, he claims that Hillary Clinton operated in secret to “enrich these global financial powers.” And if it’s bad that Bill treated women poorly, how does that make what Trump did good?

He’s demonstrated (along with his running mate) that he has no interest in dealing with “truth” and “reality.” Tallying up his comments in the second debate, he likely said more lies (33!) than truths. You cannot debate a pathological liar. The rules of the contest assume a certain level grasp of reality that are no longer present on the Republican side. 

So what would people see in a debate? Clinton trying to retain her dignity next to your worst drunk asshole uncle? That does nothing to serve democracy. In fact, it cheapens it. 

People have all the information they need to make their decisions. Pull the debate."
100560,1001,Donald Trump is using the rape of a 12-year-old girl as a human shield. Don't let him.,http://www.dailykos.com/stories/2016/10/13/1581908/-Donald-Trump-is-using-the-rape-of-a-12-year-old-as-a-human-shield-Don-t-let-him,21,"Donald Trump is most interested in attacking Hillary Clinton for things Bill Clinton did (or allegedly did) decades ago. Democrats have their response ready on those attacks. But every now and then Trump throws in another name, of a woman who claims to have been harmed by Hillary herself: Kathy Shelton. And Democrats—the kind of Democrats who go on cable news—need to get their act together on this one. The failure of Democratic surrogates like Hilary Rosen to smack down the Shelton attacks is mystifying, because this one shouldn’t be hard. 

You may have seen the viral graphic claiming that Hillary Clinton volunteered to represent a child rapist, got him freed through victim blaming, then laughed about it while admitting he was guilty. This is false, start to finish. Clinton was appointed to represent the man, and tried to get out of it. Once she was his lawyer, she defended him—but she didn’t free him. Instead, he pleaded guilty to a lesser charge, a plea supported at the time by the victim—Kathy Shelton—and her mother to avoid a grueling trial. And the supposed victim-blaming was Clinton quoting a child psychology expert in order to ask that the girl undergo a psychiatric examination.

What you’ve got to this point is Clinton doing her duty as a defense attorney. Even alleged child rapists are entitled to a defense, and someone has to do it. That’s a fundamental part of our legal system. 

Okay, but what about Clinton laughing while admitting her client’s guilt? In an interview in the 1980s, Clinton discussed the case. “Of course he claimed that he didn’t,” she said dismissively. “All this stuff.” 

He took a lie detector test! I had him take a polygraph, which he passed, which forever destroyed my faith in polygraphs.
And then she laughed a little, about her faith in polygraphs. And that’s the foundation of “she admitted she knew he was guilty and she laughed about it.” Not “oh, boy, I screwed over this 12-year-old rape victim, isn’t it hilarious,” but “hey, my client probably committed rape and yet he still passed a polygraph, so much for the reliability of lie detector tests.”

The facts are clear. The response when the Trump camp raises this is not hard: Hillary Clinton didn’t want to defend a child rapist but once a judge appointed her to do so, she did her job. She did not victim-blame. She did not free him. She did not laugh at the victim’s pain. It’s simply a lie to say Clinton did anything but her duty to her client. And Democrats need to be as clear and confident dismissing this as they are dismissing Hillary Clinton’s responsibility for her husband’s alleged past actions.

In many states, any registered voter can request an absentee ballot. Check to see if you can get one and vote early this year."

Now that the floodgates have opened on Donald Trump's sordid history of assaulting women, that is.

Let's check in. Burr, you were just named a Trump national security adviser—after the infamous Access Hollywood video release. You said you had “forgiven” Trump for his lewd comments (like it's your place to forgive that), ignoring the elephant in the room: assault. What's your level of forgiveness now, huh?

How about you, Blunt? Do you still think Trump can show that ""he is a different man than that person,"" the one who bragged about grabbing women by the genitals? Do you still think his ""apology"" was adequate?

And you, Toomey, Mr. Courage. Is this enough to get you off the fence you've been sitting on for the past five days? At some point, you're just going to have to decide, because this maybe-I'll-vote-for-him-maybe-I-won't schtick will not suffice until Nov. 8. 

Oh, little Marco. Back when the video broke, you were all, ""No one should ever talk about any woman in those terms, even in private,"" never mind what he was actually bragging about doing. You said Tuesday night that keeping Hillary Clinton out of the White House was the most important thing. Any updates from you on that thinking?

But you, Ron Johnson, genius. Seriously? Donald Trump's abuse of women is really about Russ Feingold's support for Hillary? Really? You are a genius.

You're all standing by your man Trump—or in Toomey's case, dancing around him. Because you think tying yourself to a would-be (maybe?) rapist is smart politics. You don't want to lose your base, all those Trump supporters who might turn on you. You know, the deplorable people sticking with their deplorable leader. That's more important to you than stepping up for your country. Which makes you pretty damned deplorable, too.

Can you chip in $3 to each of these candidates to send these deplorables packing? "
100562,1002,Suffolk University Poll: Statistical Tie in North Carolina,http://www.breitbart.com/big-government/2016/10/13/suffolk-university-poll-statistical-tie-north-carolina/,21,"The latest poll from Suffolk University finds a statistical tie in the presidential race in North Carolina, with Hillary Clinton leading by 45 percent to Donald Trump’s 43 percent, well within the margin of error.
Libertarian Gary Johnson drew 5 percent support in the poll. Jill Stein of the Green Party did not make the North Carolina ballot, so she is a write-in candidate. About 5 percent of voters were undecided.

Interestingly, when pollsters removed Johnson from the equation, the results changed to Clinton 23 percent, Trump 19 percent, and a whopping 31 percent undecided.

However, fully 66 percent of respondents said they expected Clinton to win the election, with only 22 percent anticipating a Trump victory.

The poll was conducted after the second presidential debate, which 70 percent of respondents said they had watched. They were fairly evenly split on who won the debate — 42 percent Clinton, 41 percent Trump. However, a much larger share of respondents thought Trump performed beyond their expectations, 51 percent to 36 percent for Clinton.

Only 14 percent said the 11-year-old video of Trump making lewd comments changed their opinion of him, while 69 percent said it did not. The top issue for respondents was terrorism and national security (20 percent), followed closely by jobs and the economy (19 percent) and the selection of Supreme Court nominees (16 percent).

The most popular term chosen for how North Carolina voters felt about the presidential election was “Alarmed” (58 percent), followed by “Excited” (22 percent) and “Bored” (13 percent).

21 percent of respondents identified as liberal, 41 percent conservative, and 33 percent moderate. Their favorite TV news source, by a significant margin, was Fox News (29 percent), with CNN taking second place at 18 percent. 66 percent of them said religion was “very important” in their lives, 20 percent said “somewhat important.”

Mitt Romney narrowly won North Carolina in the 2012 election with 50.6 percent to Barack Obama’s 48.4 percent."
100563,1002,"‘Moment of Reckoning’ — Donald Trump: ‘Our Independence Day Is at Hand, It Arrives Finally on Nov. 8th’",http://www.breitbart.com/2016-presidential-race/2016/10/13/moment-reckoning-donald-trump-independence-day-hand-arrives-finally-nov-8th/,21,"Donald Trump described the 2016 election as a make-or-break moment for the nation in a rousing speech delivered to supporters in West Palm Beach, Florida, on Thursday.
“This is our moment of reckoning as a society and as a civilization itself,” Trump declared. “This is not simply another four-year election. This is a crossroads in the history of our civilization that will determine whether or not we the people reclaim control over our government.”

“Our Independence Day is at hand, and it arrives finally on Nov. 8,” Trump told voters, adding:

Our great civilization, here in America and across the civilized world, has come upon a moment of reckoning. We’ve seen it in the United Kingdom, where they voted to liberate themselves from global government and global trade deal, and global immigration deals that have destroyed their sovereignty and have destroyed many of those nations.

But, the central base of world political power is right here in America, and it is our corrupt political establishment that is the greatest power behind the efforts at radical globalization and the disenfranchisement of working people. Their financial resources are virtually unlimited, their political resources are unlimited, their media resources are unmatched, and most importantly, the depths of their immorality is absolutely unlimited.

Trump highlighted the now well-documented collusion between the global special interests, corporate media, and Hillary Clinton who champions policies to cede “U.S. sovereignty in order to enrich these global financial powers, her special interest friends. and her donors.” Trump slammed, what he described as, our “illusion of democracy”– explaining how our political process is controlled “by a small handful of global special interests rigging the system.”

Trump explained that the “Clinton machine,” working through its arm in the corporate media, has declared “war” not just against him, but against the American people, who want to reclaim their government to represent their needs and interests, rather than simply representing the desires of corporate donors and transnational elites. Trump said:

Let’s be clear on one thing. The corporate media in our country is no longer involved in journalism. They’re a political special interest no different than any lobbyist or other financial entity with a total political agenda, and the agenda is not for you, it’s for themselves.

And their agenda is to elect crooked Hillary Clinton at any cost, at any price, no matter how many lives they destroy. For them it’s a war, and for them nothing at all is out of bounds. This is a struggle for the survival of our nation, believe me. And this will be our last chance to save it on Nov. 8, remember that.

“The only thing Hillary Clinton has going for herself is the press. Without the press, she is absolutely zero,” Trump said. He went on:

The political establishment that is trying to stop us is the same group responsible for our disastrous trade deals, massive illegal immigration, and economic and foreign policies that have bled our country dry … The Clinton machine is at the center of this power structure.

We’ve seen this first hand in the WikiLeaks documents, in which Hillary Clinton meets in secret with international banks to plot the destruction of U.S. sovereignty in order to enrich these global financial powers, her special interest friends, and her donors…

With their control over our government at stake, with trillions of dollars on the line, the Clinton machine is determined to achieve the destruction of our campaign… They knew they would throw every lie they could at me and my family and my loved ones. They knew they would stop at nothing to try to stop me. But I never knew as bad as it would be. I never knew it would be this vile, that it would be this bad, that it would be this vicious…

I will not lie to you. These false attacks are absolutely hurtful. To be lied about, to be slandered, to be smeared so publicly, and before your family that you love, is very painful. What is going on is egregious beyond any words…It’s reprehensible beyond description, it’s totally corrupt.

But, I also know that it’s not about me. It’s about all of you and it’s about our country. I know that. I fully understand that. That’s why I got involved. It’s about all of us together as a country. It’s a movement the likes of which we have never in history in this country seen before, never in history.

“I take all of these slings and arrows gladly for you. I take them for our movement so that we can have our country back,” Trump said.

Trump explained that the only thing powerful enough to stop the political machine is the American people, if they chose to rise up and vote against it on November 8th.

He explained:

The corrupt political establishment is a machine, it has no soul. I knew these false attacks would come. I knew this day would arrive; it’s only a question of when. And I knew the American people would rise above it and vote for the future they deserve.

The only thing that can stop this corrupt machine is you. The only force strong enough to save our country is us. The only people brave enough to vote out this corrupt establishment is you, the American people.

Trump continued:

This election will determine whether we are a free nation or whether we have only the illusion of democracy, but are in fact controlled by a small handful of global special interests rigging the system, and our system is rigged. This is reality, you know it, they know it, I know it, and pretty much the whole world knows it.

The establishment and their media enablers will control over this nation through means that are very well known. Anyone who challenges their control is deemed a sexist, a racist, a xenophobe, and morally deformed.

They will attack you, they will slander you, they will seek to destroy your career and your family, they will seek to destroy everything about you, including your reputation. They will lie, lie, lie, and then again they will do worse than that, they will do whatever is necessary…

This is our moment of reckoning as a society and as a civilization itself. I didn’t need to do this, folks, believe me — believe me. I built a great company and I had a wonderful life. I could have enjoyed the fruits and benefits of years of successful business deals and businesses for myself and my family. Instead of going through this absolute horror show of lies, deceptions, malicious attacks — who would have thought? I’m doing it because this country has given me so much, and I feel so strongly that it’s my turn to give back to the country that I love…

This election is about every man, woman and child in our country who deserves to live in safety, prosperity, and peace, so true. We will rise above the lies, the smears, the ludicrous slanders from ludicrous and very, very dishonest reporters.

We will vote for the country we want. We will vote for the future we want. We will vote for the politics we want and we will vote to put this corrupt government cartel out of business and out of business immediately. We will vote for the special interests and say lots of luck, but you’re being voted out of power.

They’ve betrayed our workers, they’ve betrayed our borders and, most of all, they’ve betrayed our freedoms. We will save our sovereign rights as a nation. We will end the politics of profit. We will end the rule of special interests. We will end the raiding of our jobs by other countries. We will end the total disenfranchisement of the American voter and the American worker.

Our Independence Day is at hand, and it arrives finally on Nov. 8."

Trump’s presidential campaign is firing back hard at Democratic rival Hillary Rodham Clinton after revelations in WikiLeaks-published emails from her campaign staff prove she truly does support the Trans Pacific Partnership (TPP).
“Today’s email release reveals what we already knew, that Hillary Clinton supports TPP and TPA and she lied about it to the American people at the debate,” Jason Miller, Trump’s senior communications adviser, said in a statement. “She is without a doubt opposed to America First trade policies. Clinton’s so-called opposition to TPP will fade away should she become President and she will sell us out to global special interests.”

The emails, hacked from Clinton campaign chairman John Podesta and published by WikiLeaks in the latest tranche of emails, prove that Clinton’s campaign originally assumed she would support both fast track Trade Promotion Authority (TPA) and the TPP. Then, when it became controversial, the emails show the political staffers around Hillary Clinton concocted a scheme to help her flip-flop her position to against it—not because she would be truly against it but for political purposes in order to get votes from union members.

In fact, in one such email, Clinton campaign manager Robby Mook admitted it would not be “comfortable” for Clinton to oppose something she had supported throughout her time as Secretary of State.

Not only did she support it in her book—and publicly at least 45 other times according to CNN—but according to Bloomberg she actually had “taken a leading part in drafting” the TPP as Secretary of State."
100565,1003,Bonfire of the Patriarchy,http://www.huffingtonpost.com/stephen-h-dinan/bonfire-of-the-patriarchy_b_12463200.html?utm_hp_ref=politics,21,"For the next three and a half weeks, we will bear witness to something that is exceptionally ugly but perhaps necessary for us to enter a new era.

I’m calling it the bonfire of the patriarchy.

Patriarchy is a loaded term that many non-feminists dislike but it is an accurate description of a long era of human history where men and masculinity ruled our public sphere.

There is perhaps no better marker point for the official end of the patriarchy than the election of a woman as President of the United States, the single most powerful person in the world.

Now that Hillary Clinton’s election has become likely on Nov. 8th, partially due to Trump’s history of sexually assaulting, objectifying, and demeaning women, what I believe we must now face is dozens of disclosures and chilling testimony from women who have been harmed, both by Donald Trump himself and, as the Trump campaign has now promised, by Bill Clinton.

Yesterday, three more women came forward with stories about Trump. And Trump campaign CEO Steve Bannon has now promised to “turn Bill Clinton into Bill Cosby.”

The dam has broken. It is going to get much, much worse.

Normally, women who have been victimized are silenced by the threat of legal repercussions or media smears but now will be their moment to speak with the safety that comes in numbers

It will be very hard but important to witness.

The abuses of women by men in power has been the dirty secret of the patriarchy since time immemorial. Many titans of industry, political leaders, and powerful figures have each done their share, including those we still celebrate. It’s been part of the “spoils” of victory and the perks of power to use that power to take sexual advantage of women.

This propensity towards sexual conquest, groping, and rape lingers from our genetic line; when alpha male primates experienced a surge of testosterone as they advanced in the social hierarchy, they often took females sexually by force.

I believe this biological history is part of why otherwise reasonable men have done this again and again as they ascend into power.

In today’s world, this is no longer tolerable. It is time for a permanent end to accepting this behavior on any level, which, in turn, is a prerequisite for women to feel honored, respected and safe in the world.

This is not a women’s issue. It’s a human issue. As a man, I am committed to ending sexual assault, not just because I have women in my life that I love but because it’s crippling our ability to create a healthy society for all, including men. Once powerful men are comfortable taking advantage of women sexually, they become prone to many other kinds of abuse as well.

So what we must now go through, on the cusp of the dawning of a new era beyond the patriarchy, is witnessing the terrible trail of trauma that lies behind some of the most powerful and respected men in the world.

The silence must be broken fully so that it really becomes clear that we simply cannot allow this any more.

It will be ugly, sad, demeaning, and demoralizing. It will be a kind of Armageddon of our cultural shadow.

And yet, I want to encourage all of us to hold open our hearts, have compassion for both Donald Trump and Bill Clinton as they go through this bonfire (as well as Hillary and Melania).

It will be painful to witness as both of these powerful men have their shadowy history exposed.

And, this may be exactly the medicine we need right now - an exposure of the ugly side of male dominance and exploitation of the feminine in order that we can truly enter a new era, one in which respect for women, true equality, and safety for all is non-negotiable.

Witnessing this bonfire will send a strong message to the gropers, abusers, and rapists of the world. Subconsciously, they will know that the gig is up and the era in which that is permissable is coming to an end.

We will, as a whole society and world, come to the point of saying, “Enough.”

With that said, we must also forgive in order for the whole pattern to truly heal. If we remain in righteous moralization on what we witness, we will also forget that these powerful men are also divine souls on a path of maturation.

There will need to be healing and reconciliation, but after they have fully faced what they have wrought with humility and contrition.

I am convinced that Hillary Clinton will emerge from this bonfire as our first woman President. But she will likely be scarred in the process.

Let us hold her in the light so that she can govern in this new era with wisdom.

And let us all be willing to witness the bonfire with as much love as we can muster and recognize this as an historic moment in which an old patterns of domination and exploitation are dying to give rise to a new era in which women and men together create a more just, peaceful, and loving world.

That is the phoenix that can arise from the ashes."
100566,1003,This Year’s Trump And 2020’s ‘NextTrump’,http://www.huffingtonpost.com/mary-buffett/this-years-trump-and-2020_b_12477838.html?utm_hp_ref=politics,21,"If a soap opera scriptwriter were to pen the drama of this political season as afternoon fare, it would be laughed out of the writer’s room. Nobody would believe it. As a nation, we are dragging ourselves to the finish line, exhausted and full of mud, and we are counting down each day until we arrive at November 8th. We want to be put out of our misery.

Just when you think that this race cannot get any crazier, it continues to surprise and descend further. After last Friday’s episode of Donald Trump as “Uncle Creepy,” along with the soon unemployed Billy Bush as wingman, they engaged in what was called “Locker Room Talk.”

Days later, the nation staggered through a debate where pundits and commentators competed to outdo themselves with disgust. Donald Trump, we now know was trying to sneak four women who were critical of both Clintons into the family section in order to create a confrontation between them and the former President. Trump skulked around and appeared to stalk Secretary Clinton throughout most of the debate.

While Trump denied that he had sexually abused anybody, more and more women are coming out of the woodwork to say that they have been abused by Donald Trump. What is a trickle should build into a tsunami by Election Day.

The Trump candidacy died like roadkill on the interstate. This is something that will bedevil political science professors until the end of time, but somehow a “B list” celebrity with a bottomless ego and a greatly inflated balance sheet threatened to wreck the American experiment. As a nation, we are in the process of dragging ourselves to a conclusion, even though no long hot shower can fully remove the mud and grime of this political season.

This week, Donald Trump has decided to go after the very people who would help him win the race and potentially even govern as political leaders like Paul Ryan released House members to run for their political lives. Trump also remains livid that people like Lindsay Graham, John McCain and nearly 25% of GOP officeholders (at the Senate Congressional and Gubernatorial level) have chosen to repudiate him as their nominee. This is simply astonishing from a political party that prided itself on lock step discipline.

The overall Trump Brand is dead too—as dead as his candidacy. All of those buildings that bare the words “Trump” at the penthouse level are essentially licensing deals, where others construct the building and use his name to fill vacancies. Before the campaign began, Trump—even with his perceived flaws—had a silhouette of success for those who viewed him from a distance.

The scrutiny of a national political campaign has reduced his name and brand to shambles. Once Trump owned a bankable last name but now that brand is tarnished. Since allegation after allegation fell out of the Trump campaign, his brand is now a tarnished mess, aligned with Russian oligarchs, alt-right hackers, white supremacists, and sexual perverts. Who is going to build the next Trump Tower in the United States when his last name is a “bat signal” for everything that is wrong in our democracy? Perhaps the future of Trump is elsewhere, like Russia and some of its former satellites that are ruled by strongmen, where the embrace of such character defects is seen as a good thing.

However there is one silver lining in this political train wreck. We realized that our democracy was under attack and a number of people put our nation ahead of their normal political affiliations. Newspapers that had normally endorsed Republicans jumped the broom and realized that while Secretary Clinton might not be their cup of tea, she was certainly better than a glass of strychnine which symbolized the Trump candidacy.

There also is a personal element to this. I know what it’s like to be the only “girl in the boardroom,” the person who is diminished because of my gender or judged by my exterior as opposed to what’s in my brain. I’ve had a number of slurs thrown my way over the years. The entertainment industry is also full of stories of bad behavior, tales which are often recounted by a variety of my friends after a glass or two of wine. However, we fought so that the next generation might have it easier. I am heartened to see that the next generation is working even harder to be seen and heard on equal footing.

However, it’s not just a matter of teaching young women what not to tolerate; it is also a longer explanation to our young sons—as they grow into young men—that “Locker Room Talk” espoused by Donald Trump should be padlocked forever.

The campaign is essentially over but it’s not. Watching Donald Trump these days reminds me of the final scene from Doctor Strangelove where Slim Pickens rides the nuclear weapon to begin nuclear Armageddon. What started out as a 50-50 race quickly descended into chaos never seen in our lifetimes. The bottom fell out of the Trump campaign and states that once were “sure things” for Trump have moved away. Even places Utah, which gave President Obama only 24% is now listed as a toss-up thanks to a fourth party candidate. However, the sad thing is this: While Trump is toast; Trumpism will be around for a long time to come.

Trumpism will reappear under new management in 2020 and somebody will be the NextTrump. It may not have the rogue’s gallery of people like Steve Bannion, David Bossie or Roger Stone, but somebody will figure out how to press the buttons Trump pushed as he obliterated a generation of GOP leadership and won the nomination. They will figure out how to whip up resentment and class “dog whistles” without Trump’s anger, erratic behavior, a closet full of skeletons—and do it with a folksy demeanor.

The NextTrump won’t have the baggage and the tawdry sexual resume. He or she will come along in a smiling face and they might be harder to stop.

In finale, Donald Trump wanted to be the president in the very worst way—and has reaped his just rewards. However, it is the future, the season of the NextTrump, which should cause for many more sleepless nights."

Now add to this cavalcade of confusion the volte-face of a handful of prominent evangelical voices who, up until this moment, declared Trump “a morally good choice.” Such reversals do not signal remorse and enlightenment, however, but rather desperation and denial.

Everyone who has endorsed Trump, politician or preacher, has been diminished by the association. Yet chief among these tragic figures is Wayne Grudem, professor of theology and biblical studies at Phoenix University and author of Systematic Theology: An Introduction to Biblical Doctrine, a required text in many evangelical colleges and seminaries. In late July, Grudem published a 5,000-word defense of Trump that kicked up a firestorm. No other evangelical thinker attempted such an ambitious project—the reconstruction of Donald Trump into a credible presidential candidate—couched in the language of moral theology and prudential politics.

In reality, Grudem’s polemic was shot through with half-truths, facile assumptions, tortured logic, and emotional manipulation. His eleventh-hour abandonment of Trump suggests something of the anguished state of militant evangelicalism.

Offering not a scintilla of evidence, Grudem at first concluded that “Trump’s character is far better than what is portrayed by much current political mudslinging, and far better than his opponent’s character.” Declaring the need to make “an ethical decision” in this election, Grudem wrote, “we should base the decision on the most likely results. In this case, the most likely result is that Trump will do most or all of what he has said.” Put aside the inconvenient fact that Trump’s political views are amorphous and malleable, that he shows no capacity to work with the legislative branch of government, and that much of his agenda represents an assault on the constitution and the international norms upholding human rights.

Grudem ended his essay with a moral taunt about as damning as any Puritan jeremiad ever delivered:

But the most likely result of not voting for Trump is that you will be abandoning thousands of unborn babies who will be put to death under Hillary Clinton’s Supreme Court, thousands of Christians who will be excluded from their lifelong occupations... thousands of sick and elderly who will never get adequate medical treatment when the government is the nation’s only healthcare provider, thousands of people who will be killed by an unchecked ISIS, and millions of Jews in Israel who will find themselves alone and surrounded by hostile enemies. And you will be contributing to a permanent loss of the American system of government due to a final victory of unaccountable judicial tyranny.
Yes, gentle Christian voter, this apocalyptic cascade of events—the abandonment of entire classes of people to perdition and the permanent loss of American democracy—must be placed on your shoulders for failing to endorse Donald Trump for president. This is what passes as serious ethical reflection in evangelical circles.

But of course that was Wayne Grudem’s position in late July. The Trump video, in which the candidate boats of sexually assaulting women, apparently transformed Grudem’s political theology overnight. His pious defense of the Republican nominee morphed into a slippery, Trump-like non-apology for having done so. “I previously called Donald Trump a ‘good candidate with flaws’ and a ‘flawed candidate,’” he wrote in Townhall.com, “but I now regret that I did not more strongly condemn his moral character.”

The deepest problem for Grudem, and others like him, is that his original manipulation of Trump’s record was a deliberate evasion of the truth. Even now, Grudem cannot speak frankly, in total candor, about his previous endorsement. “I did not take the time to investigate earlier allegations in detail, and I now wish I had done so,” he says. “If I had read or heard some of these materials earlier, I would not have written as positively as I did about Donald Trump.”

The evasion of truth persists: Grudem expended 5,000 words to reimagine Donald Trump according to his liking, but “did not take the time to investigate” Trump’s public record and character? Like everyone else following Trump’s ascendancy, he knew all about the lies and misstatements, the infidelities, the misogyny, the mockery of the disabled, the race-baiting rhetoric, the attacks on a grieving gold-star family, and on and on. Grudem did not merely write “positively” about Trump; he wrote dogmatically, with moral certitude. “I feel the force of the words of James,” he intoned. “Whoever knows the right thing to do and fails to do it, for him it is sin.” And for all this sanctimony he offers no apology—not to his students, for whose moral formation he is partially responsible, nor to the larger Christian community he hoped to influence.

In the war of words during this disgraceful campaign, on both sides of the political aisle, truth has been the most conspicuous casualty. But how do we explain the failure to uphold basic norms about truth-telling among Bible-believing Christians?

History offers some clues. There is a belligerent strain in Protestant Christianity, embodied in the Calvinist tradition to which Grudem belongs, which has been willing to sacrifice moral and biblical truth in the pursuit of noble ends. John Calvin, supremely confident he had recovered a neglected view of predestination, sought to build a community of “the elect” in Geneva—and adopted a theology justifying the banishment, vilification, and execution of dissenters in order to achieve it. His doctrine was a violent rejection of the life and teachings of Christ. The English Puritans, overwhelmingly Calvinist, viewed the kingship of Charles I as the great obstacle to their hopes for a godly commonwealth. They wanted to blow up the old order. They instigated a civil war, orchestrated the king’s execution, and turned to a “man on horseback” to inaugurate a new regime: Oliver Cromwell. Like the Puritan project in Salem, Massachusetts, the experiment did not end well.

It is perhaps no accident that Grudem is considered a leading light among the “new Calvinists,” a small but vocal group of hard-line thinkers and preachers who hold an uncompromising view of the Calvinist doctrines of election and predestination. Like the old Calvinism, the new Calvinism teaches its adherents that they are a righteous remnant battling a godless and hostile political culture. This is not the place to debate Protestant theology, but the tribalism and dogmatism of historic Calvinism may have found a political outlet. As one theologian and critic put it recently: “I think Calvinism is the Donald Trump of theology.”

That’s a harsh verdict. Many believers outside the Calvinist or Reformed tradition, after all, have endorsed Trump, and some prominent Calvinists have denounced him as unfit for the presidency. Nevertheless, the rise of Trump represents an illness in the body politic—a politics of self-righteous rage that has an analog in militant Christianity. It is time, inside the church, for a ruthless moral inventory. As the Scripture warns: “Judgment begins in the house of God.”"
100568,1004,NY Times Responds To Trump's Threat To Sue Over Groping Allegations,http://talkingpointsmemo.com/livewire/nytimes-responds-trump-lawsuit-threat-groping-allegations,21,"The New York Times responded Thursday to Donald Trump's threat of legal action against the Times for its report on allegations by two women that Trump groped each of them, decades apart.

""The essence of a libel claim, of course, is the protection of one's reputation,"" David McCraw, assistant general council at the New York Times, wrote in a letter. ""Nothing in our article has had the slightest effect on the reputation that Mr. Trump, through his own words and actions, has already created for himself.""

McCraw cited Trump's comments in a leaked 2005 video, in which he bragged about grabbing women's genitals, as indicative of his reputation. He also cited a 2004 interview resurfaced by CNN in which Trump acquiesced to shock jock Howard Stern's request to refer to his daughter, Ivanka Trump, as ""a piece of ass.""

""We published newsworthy information about a subject of deep public concern,"" McCraw wrote. ""If Mr. Trump disagrees, if he believes that American citizens had no right to hear what these women had to say and that the law of this country forces us and those who would dare to criticize him to stand silent or be punished, we welcome the opportunity to have a court set him straight.""

On Wednesday night, the Times published a report detailing allegations by two women who say that Trump touched them inappropriately. Several other women came forward in stories published later that same night with their own accounts of being groped or forcibly kissed by Trump.

After the Times published its report, Marc E. Kasowitz, a lawyer for Trump, sent the Times a letter calling the article ""reckless and defamatory.""

At a campaign rally Thursday afternoon, Trump also claimed that his campaign was ""preparing"" a lawsuit against the Times.

Speaking at a Donald Trump rally in Florida, he claimed that newspapers publish allegations against Trump without evidence on Page One but bury revelations from Wikileaks email dumps about Clinton on Page 10.

He railed against several news organizations, calling the New York Times the ""Clinton Campaign Newsletter"" and referred to CNN as the ""Clinton News Network."" He said that the media is engaged in a ""conspiracy"" with Democrats and the Clinton campaign.

He cited an email from Donna Brazile obtained by Wikileaks that he claimed suggested she had access to primary debate questions in advance and may have sent them to the Clinton campaign. (Brazile has denied having access to the questions in advance.)

""You call that crooked. You call that cheating,"" Giuliani said.

He said that news coverage of the election is ""absurd,"" complaining that Trump ""makes a joke and its turned into some serious comment."""

Trump had been scheduled to appear on ""Hannity"" on Thursday night, according to a CNN Money report, but backed out just before noon.

A Fox spokesperson told TPM that the interview with Trump would be rescheduled, but did not provide further details.

According to CNN, ""CBS This Morning"" hosts also had difficulty getting hold of a Trump representative to discuss the groping allegations.

""We asked the Trump Organization to provide someone to talk to us, but it was unable to do so,"" Norah O'Donnell noted, according to the report.

Fox News is still set to air a special program Thursday night hosted by Hannity that features three women who have accused Bill Clinton of sexual misconduct, according to CNN.

Multiple women came forward in stories published Wednesday with their accounts of being groped or forcibly kissed by Donald Trump.

The Trump campaign has denied the allegations made by two women in one report by the New York Times as ""fiction."""
100571,1005,Surprise! Donald Trump's Supporters Don't Believe His Newest Accusers Either,http://www.motherjones.com/politics/2016/10/surprise-donald-trump-supporters-dont-believe-his-newest-accusers-either,21,"At a Thursday afternoon rally in West Palm Beach, an angry Donald Trump railed against the women who have accused him of sexual assault, promising that he would soon release evidence that would clear him of any wrongdoing and reveal the whole thing to be a sordid ""conspiracy."" But even before the Republican nominee took the stage, many of the supporters who crowded into the hall at the South Florida Fairgrounds had already made up their minds: Donald didn't do it. And besides, others rationalized, if he did it, it was a long time ago, and have you heard about Bill Clinton? Trump backer Gloria Bachhus brought up the sexual assault allegations against Trump before I had a chance to ask her a question. ""Oh, you're a reporter? I've got something to tell you,"" she said. ""I'm in the aviation business. They said some stupid thing that Trump in 1981 was grabbing a woman, and she said that she was sitting in first class."" She grabbed my arm for emphasis. ""Listen to me: She said that the [armrest] wasn't down. Well, in first class they don't have arms in the plane, in 1981. So she lied, okay? We know in the aviation business, first class does not have an arm! It has it in economy. You sit down and you separate from all the people on both sides. In first class you have your big seat and you don't have an arm."" (Jessica Leeds, one of the women who has accused Trump of groping her, told the New York Times that Trump had lifted the arm rest and began touching her during a flight several decades ago.)

""They're very weak, insincere,"" another Trump supporter, Charles Wood, said of the GOP nominee's accusers. ""Probably not true."" When I asked why he thought they would make their stories up, his wife jumped in. ""Money! And fame, attention.""

""I'm just so sick of all that,"" Nancy King told me as she leaned against the steel dividers separating the press from the audience. ""These women that 13 years later, all of a sudden, it's just crazy. You know? To me, a person's character, yes, that's important, but the women's character is just as bad. I mean just the fact that they would come out 13 years later and try to prove that. I see that as being opportunist.""

Maureen Salvo, an immigrant from the United Kingdom who told me ""all the strong women"" at her condo are voting for Trump, needed one word to sum up her feelings about the groping allegations. ""Bullshit! Bullshit! Bullshit!"" she said. ""I think Clinton is corrupt, she's getting scared now. They're all coming up—I think she got them to say what she wants."" But even if the reports were true, that wouldn't change Salvo's preference. ""He's just a man,"" she said. That's what men do.

Like a number of voters, Nancy Severson from Wellington was suspicious of why allegations of Trump's inappropriate conduct were just coming out now. ""That's a little late for that. I mean, I'm certainly not for men taking advantage of women or women taking advantage of men, but in this case, it seems like the timing is questionable—why it's coming out now."" So who was behind it? ""Oh, I definitely think it's her campaign,"" she said, referring to Hillary Clinton. ""There's a whole spin thing going on over there.""

Lisa Branden, a supporter from Royal Palm, Florida, who hoped that Trump might help her get better health insurance, told me, ""I'm not worried about it."" Why not? ""Look, they're all against him—the media, the mainstream media, Washington—they're all up against Trump, so they're gonna throw everything they have at him. I told my husband that from the beginning. They're gonna try to bring him down any way they can.""

""I don't really care about his past indiscretions,"" said Joe Paisano, a senior citizen in a Hawaiian shirt standing under a big American flag. ""What I care about is what he's going to do for the country, what he's going to do for America, what he's gonna do for us working guys, what he's gonna do for the vets.""

While most Trump supporters expressed concerns about the media (more than a few held up signs calling CNN ""Clinton News Network""), none were as fatalist as Ron Guziek, a bearded man in a ""Daytona Bike Week"" T-shirt. ""It's not going to have an effect,"" he said of the sexual-assault allegations. ""The Bilderbergers have already decided who's going to win."""
100572,1005,"Trump Attacks His Accusers in His Most Extreme, Angry, and Unhinged Speech Yet",http://www.motherjones.com/politics/2016/10/donald-trump-gives-his-most-extreme-speech-yet-florida,21,"Facing allegations that he sexually assaulted several women, Donald Trump gave the most extreme and angry speech of his campaign on Thursday, during a rally in West Palm Beach, Florida. The GOP nominee, who tweeted on Tuesday that the ""shackles have been taken off me,"" lashed out at the ""corporate"" media, the women who have accused him of kissing and touching them without consent, and a ""globalist"" criminal conspiracy involving Hillary Clinton, her husband, and international bankers.

After a string of warm-up speakers who only indirectly referred to the sexual assault allegations, Trump cut straight to the chase. ""These claims are fabricated,"" he declared angrily. ""They are lies. These events never happened—and the people who brought them—you take a look at these people, you study these people, and you'll understand that also."" Zeroing in on a reporter for People magazine, who said that Trump assaulted her during a 2005 interview, Trump seemed to dismiss her account by insulting her looks. ""Think of it,"" Trump said, ""she's doing a story on Melania, who is pregnant at the time, and Donald Trump, our one-year anniversary, and she said I made inappropriate advances. And by the way, the area was a public area, people all over the place. Take a look, you take a look, look at her, look at her words. You tell me what you think. I don't think so.""

Trump claimed he possessed information that would debunk the claims that he sexually assaulted these women: ""We already have substantial evidence to dispute these lies and it will be made public in an appropriate way at an appropriate time very soon.""

The GOP nominee sought to tie the cascading allegations against him to a broader anti-Trump conspiracy cooked up by media conglomerates, the Clinton campaign, and shadowy international interests. ""The corporate media in our country is no longer involved in journalism,"" he said. ""There's a political, special interest, no different than any lobbyist or other financial entity, with a total political agenda. The agenda is not for you, it's for themselves."" Trump charged that journalists ""collaborate and conspire directly with the Clinton campaign on helping her win the election."" He proclaimed, ""This is a conspiracy against you, the American people, and we cannot let it happen."" It was a plot, he said, to promote ""radical globalization"" and to protect a ""corrupt establishment."" The only way to thwart the evil cabal, he insisted, was to elect Trump president. But, he warned, the schemers had rigged the system to elect Clinton and keep Trump out. It was a clear message: if Clinton wins, she will be an illegitimate and criminal president representing sinister forces intent on screwing Americans. A Clinton victory, he signaled, would mean the election was fixed—a betrayal that no patriotic American should accept. 

Throughout the speech, Trump used harsh language that evoked old and ugly anti-Semitic conspiracy theories about international bankers who supposedly infiltrate national governments and control the global agenda. Citing recent Clinton campaign emails published by WikiLeaks, Trump told the crowd that ""Clinton meets in secret with international banks in order to plot the destruction of US sovereignty."" Echoing the rhetoric of Alex Jones and other conspiracy theorists, Trump repeatedly referred to ""globalists"" as the true enemy and Clinton as their handmaiden.

The crowd, packed into an indoor venue at the South Florida fairgrounds, lapped up Trump's terrifying message. His supporters repeatedly turned toward the press pen to heckle reporters with chants of ""CNN sucks!"" and ""Treason!"" During the tirade, Trump said that he felt ""hurt"" personally by the media coverage of his White House bid, but he added that race was not ""hell"" for him. The campaign, he declared, was ""a journey to heaven."""
100573,1005,Former Miss Teen USA Accuses Trump of Racial Preferences at Pageants,http://www.motherjones.com/politics/2016/10/former-miss-teen-usa-says-trump-liked-certain-types-black-people,21,"As women continue to come forward with allegations of sexual assault and misconduct by Donald Trump, news outlets have also begun reporting on his behavior at beauty pageants. On Wednesday, BuzzFeed reported that at least five women competing in the 1997 Miss Teen USA pageant recalled Trump entering a dressing room while the contestants, some of them as young as 15 years old, were changing. On Thursday, the Guardian shared a similar story from a Miss USA contestant who said that Trump ""just barged right in"" to the contestants' dressing room despite being told that the women were undressed.

But according to one former Miss Teen USA, Trump's beauty pageant misdeeds didn't stop at entering dressing rooms, but also extended to racist behavior towards black contestants.

In a series of tweets posted Wednesday, Kamie Crawford described her first interaction with Donald Trump after winning the competition in 2010. Crawford, who was seventeen at the time and was the first black girl to win the title in nearly a decade, said that prior to meeting Trump, she was warned that ""Mr. Trump doesn't like black people,"" and that if he did respond to her kindly, it would be because she was the ""type of black he likes."" Crawford also recalled a moment when Trump turned his back on a black contestant during rehearsals for Miss Universe: She adds that Trump proudly showed her off after her victory, and in another tweet says that he ""bragged about how 'beautiful' and 'well spoken'"" she was: Crawford's story is not the first time that Trump has been accused of being racially insensitive towards pageant contestants. Earlier this month, Trump engaged in a highly public feud with Alicia Machado, a Latina Miss Universe winner whom Trump once referred to as ""Miss Housekeeping."" The Republican presidential candidate has also been heavily criticized by black former Apprentice contestants, who have said that Trump—who once suggested that the show have a Black vs. White season—clearly favored white competitors.

100574,1006,WSJ/NBC poll: Trump back on top in Ohio,http://hotair.com/archives/2016/10/13/wsjnbc-poll-trump-back-top-ohio/,21,"Probably his best poll anywhere in a week, and a useful shot of morale for supporters as evidence that the “Access Hollywood” uproar might be blowing over — especially after that bloodbath poll of the state yesterday. If you believe WSJ/NBC, he’s back on track there after having trailed Clinton in the last four surveys.

Note, though, that the poll was conducted between October 10-12. It includes reaction to Sunday’s debate but little, if any, reaction to the groping accusations that dropped last night.

In Ohio, Trump holds a one-point advantage over Clinton among likely voters, 42 percent to 41 percent, with Johnson at 9 percent and Stein at 4 percent, although that margin is inside the poll’s margin of error.

Clinton and Trump are tied in a two-way race in the Buckeye State — 45 percent to 45 percent…

In Ohio, incumbent GOP Sen. Rob Portman holds an 18-point lead over Democratic challenger Ted Strickland, 55 percent to 37 percent.
The Senate Republican is running 14 points ahead of the Republican presidential nominee. As for how Trump’s doing it, that’s simple. WSJ/NBC is expecting a much redder electorate this year than Ohio saw in 2012: Even with higher Republican turnout, Trump’s been stuck in the low 40s in Ohio polling for weeks. He’s been at either 42 or 43 percent in the four-way race in eight of the last nine polls there. He leads in this one not because he’s rising but because Clinton, who’d been in the mid-40s in the last few surveys, suddenly dipped to 41 percent. That’s a function of NBC’s turnout model more than anything else, I’d guess, but who knows? Maybe some of the Wikileaks stuff that’s come out has hurt her with young progressives.

Ohio is the good news in the poll. The bad news is North Carolina, where Clinton leads by four, 45/41. That’s tied for her biggest lead there this month, and it continues a string of 10 straight polls of NC that she’s topped. Her overall lead isn’t big at 2.9 points but it’s been durable and 41 percent is Trump’s smallest number there in October. Everyone’s studied enough electoral maps by now to know that he needs both of these states to go red to have any chance to win: At the barest minimum, his path to 270 requires Ohio, North Carolina, Florida, and then, if Pennsylvania is a lost cause, some kind of toss-up-state grab bag plus an upset or two in blue states like Wisconsin. Nevada’s been a strong swing state for him all year but he’s down by four and six points in two new polls there. The last poll of New Hampshire was tight but he hasn’t led a single survey there all year. Florida has been close for most of the race but Clinton seems to have built a reliable three-point lead lately. He’s not contesting Virginia anymore. Pennsylvania is what it is. And Utah and Georgia might be prepared to take electoral votes out of his column, which, if it happens, would largely offset even a gigantic Trump upset in PA. Even Ohio is complicated right now because Gary Johnson is winning 25 percent of voters under 30 there in the NBC poll. If they shift away from the third-party candidate down the stretch, odds are they’ll be shifting towards Clinton given young America’s liberal tilt. Winning Ohio would be nice, but Ohio was always a stepping stone for Trump. Where’s the next step?

Here he is at a rally today promising to release evidence that disproves the sexual assault allegations against him “at the appropriate time.” No rush, buddy."
100575,1006,Trump: There’s a global cabal involving international banks and the media that’s bleeding our country dry,http://hotair.com/archives/2016/10/13/trump-theres-global-cabal-involving-international-banks-media-thats-bleeding-country-dry/,21,"The key bit in the clip below runs from about two minutes in to the ten-minute mark. I guess, when your campaign theme is “America First,” you’re duty bound to give a speech at some point about shadowy bloodsuckers using their control of the banks and the media to sap America of its national vitality.

Give him credit for using the somewhat more politically correct term “global power structure” in lieu of the more traditional “cabal.” Full transcript here:

For those who control the levers of power in Washington, and for the global special interests, they partner with these people that don’t have your good in mind. Our campaign represents a true existential threat like they haven’t seen before…

The political establishment that is trying to stop us is the same group responsible for our disastrous trade deals, massive illegal immigration and economic and foreign policies that have bled our country dry…

The Clinton machine is at the center of this power structure. We’ve seen this first hand in the WikiLeaks documents, in which Hillary Clinton meets in secret with international banks to plot the destruction of U.S. sovereignty in order to enrich these global financial powers, her special interest friends and her donors…

Let’s be clear on one thing, the corporate media in our country is no longer involved in journalism. They’re a political special interest no different than any lobbyist or other financial entity with a total political agenda, and the agenda is not for you, it’s for themselves…

This election will determine whether we are a free nation or whether we have only the illusion of democracy, but are in fact controlled by a small handful of global special interests rigging the system, and our system is rigged. This is reality, you know it, they know it, I know it, and pretty much the whole world knows it. The establishment and their media enablers [wield] control over this nation through means that are very well known.
That’s an efficient medley of nationalism’s greatest hits, with secret international plots (i.e. Clinton’s Wall Street speeches), government control by usurpers, and parasite imagery. The one unfamiliar note is the culprit — normally it’s not “the Clinton machine” that’s at the center of the cabal. That’s the difference between Trump and his alt-right fan base. But those who know this tune know how the real lyrics go. They’ll appreciate it, and find it significant that he’s willing to play it on a stage this big in the first place. And it is pretty significant. This is bound to appeal to all sorts of grassroots righties who don’t read alt-right propaganda right now but will be more open to it when they finally encounter it now that Trump’s laid the political groundwork for them. I did … not expect that his big pushback to the sexual-assault story last night would be an Internet rant about the New World Order with some stuff about the Clintons swapped in for the usual parts about the “Jewish octopus” or whatever, but oh well.

Whether you like it or not, try at least to appreciate the relative restraint of this, because if Trump crashes and burns next month and nationalists are further radicalized by the bitterness of his defeat, maybe the next leader of the movement will be more of a traditionalist in assigning blame about who stabbed America in the back. Enjoy the new National Front GOP."

Hours after the story broke, I interviewed former US Attorney Joe DiGenova on WMAL in Washington DC. He said his sources at the FBI and the Justice Department told him that things are only going to get worse for Director James Comey: This is a big development. This means there are some great, traditional, honest people inside the FBI and DOJ who will not let this stand. They know that Comey is a dirty cop and they are disgusted. Inside the bureau I had a meeting today with a senior former FBI agent who told me this exact story. That people are starting to talk. They’re calling their former friends outside the bureau asking for help. We were asked, today, to provide legal representation for people inside the bureau and we agreed to do so. And, to former agents who want to come forward to talk.

Comey thought this was going to go away. It is not. People inside the  are furious. They are embarrassed. They feel they are being led by a hack. But, more than that, they think he’s a crook. They think he’s fundamentally dishonest. They have no confidence in him. The bureau, inside, right now… is a mess.
As women come out of the woodwork and charge Donald Trump with assault allegations that couldn’t possibly be verified (like the New York Times printing an account from a plane trip 30 years ago) you would think one or two career investigators or lawyers would stand up for the rule of law and publicly reveal the truth behind the investigation that was apparently abandoned by Comey for political purposes.

Perhaps Mr. DiGenova’s offer to provide legal assistance will help coax some of these investigators out of the shadows and become a symbol for law and order. After all, our nation was founded on the principle that no one is above the law and “justice for all” is supposed to mean even a powerful presidential candidate must answer for their misdeeds. Last I checked, that’s why most FBI agents got into law enforcement in the first place."

Sure, the leaked Trump video is bad – and now the New York Times just published an article saying the GOP nominee inappropriately touched two women.

But on the main issues – Obamacare, illegal immigration, terrorism – Trump is spot-on. Black voters have taken notice.

In just 10 days, The Donald’s numbers with blacks have doubled. Maybe the black community saw this WikiLeaks reveal where Hillary demeans blacks and Muslims.

On an even bigger note, Trump is leading Hillary nationally 43% to 41% according to Rasmussen, as well.

NYT’s response?

Bring it on! From The Blaze:

The New York Times responded Thursday to Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump’s threat of a libel suit against the publication after it reported that two women alleged that Trump touched them inappropriately. The Times spoke to Jessica Leeds, who alleged that Trump groped her on a flight over 30 years ago, and Rachel Crooks, who said Trump kissed her on the mouth without her consent in her workplace in 2005. When the Times asked Trump about the allegations, he denied them, saying “none of this ever took place.” The Times reported that Trump then began shouting at their reporter. “You are a disgusting human being,” he told the reporter as she questioned him about the allegations. In a letter to Trump’s attorney Marc Kasowitz sent Thursday, New York Times general counsel David McCraw wrote that the publication stands by its story.

…

“If Mr. Trump disagrees, if he believes that American citizens had no right to hear what these women had to say and that the law of this country forces us and those who would dare to criticize him to stand silent or be punished, we welcome the opportunity to have a court set him straight,” McCraw wrote. Full letter from NYT…

 The left-leaning media will literally do anything to destroy Trump’s chances at becoming president.

Funny how all these sexual assault-related stories are popping up just three weeks before election day, huh?"
100579,1007,"CBS and ABC Basically Ignore WikiLeaks Evidence Against Hillary, Call It A “Distraction”",http://www.youngcons.com/cbs-and-abc-basically-ignore-wikileaks-evidence-against-hillary-call-it-a-distraction/,21,"The WikiLeaks documents that have come out this week are a huge problem for Hillary.

The media has done a great job completely ignoring it.

If the things we are learning about Hillary had been revealed about a Republican the world would be on fire.

Check out how two major networks characterized these damning emails.

From Newsbusters:

On Thursday, both CBS This Morning and ABC’s Good Morning America framed the release of Clinton campaign e-mails as a “distraction” for the Democratic nominee while continuing to censor some of the worst revelations, including several exchanges in which staffers attacked Catholics. By contrast, NBC’s Today at least mentioned the controversy. On This Morning, correspondent Nancy Cordes fretted: “Wikileaks says it has 50,000 of John Podesta’s e-mails, and if what we’ve seen so far is any indication, the group plans to release another batch of them every day between now and the election. Enough to create a steady stream of embarrassment for the Clinton campaign, which aides argue is exactly what the Russians and Trump want.”

On Good Morning America, correspondent Tom Llamas announced: “The self-proclaimed ‘unshackled’ Trump sending his base into a feeding frenzy over those hacked e-mails.” The headline on screen throughout the segment declared: “Clinton Camp Faces Its Own Distractions.” Unreal.

To the mainstream media, the Hillary campaign bashing Catholics, trying to trick Bernie Sanders, lamenting “need Latinos”, telling Wall Street execs she is looking out for them, and coordinating with the media is just a “distraction”. No, no.

Your network is doing the distracting.

Distracting the American people from what is really going on behind the scenes of the most corrupt presidential candidate in recent history."
100580,1008,"For President, Vote for the Judiciary and for America",http://www.americanthinker.com/articles/2016/10/for_president_vote_for_the_judiciary_and_for_america.html,21,"So let me understand this

Bill Clinton sexually frolicked with Gennifer Flowers, apparently sexually abused Paula Corbin (paying her an $850,000 litigation settlement) and Kathleen Willey. Leveraged his workplace supervisory position over Monica Lewinsky to convert the Oval Office into a sexually hostile workplace environment, even as he gazed into her gullible eyes, inter alia, and promised that he would divorce Hillary and would marry Lewinsky after his presidency. If we are to believe the accuser -- as Hillary tells us we must -- he raped Juanita Broaddrick. Ultimately, the state bar of Arkansas disbarred Bill Clinton for perjury.

Bill Clinton is the modern-day hero of the Democrat Party. He appears as the star of the Democrat convention every four years. His words inspire Democrats. He is legend. The mainstream media cannot praise and glorify him enough. Hillary Clinton sends him on the campaign trail to stump for her, to speak for her. His word, his endorsement, is sacrosanct.

And yet he has been a serial sexual abuser for decades -- “because [he] could.” Alongside him, always defending him and thereby assuring her own continued access to power, to serve her own voracious ambitions, Hillary Clinton actively helped destroy women victims who spoke out.

Suddenly now the same mainstream media, who have found no one more suited in character and temperament for the presidency than Bill Clinton, instruct us that Donald Trump contrarily is disqualified for the presidency because a “hot mic” eleven years ago caught him ogling and boasting disgustingly about sexual exploits?

It is impossible not to be disgusted with all of these characters. We are mired in a kakistocracy of epic proportions. Trump with his bizarre ego, the insults and calumny and falsifications and exaggerations that have allowed others to puncture the urgently important and pure message that he repeatedly has compromised as its leading messenger. Even more, Hillary Clinton with her congenital lying, to the point of lying about why she was named “Hillary.” She inspires no trust in its most absolute vacuum. Travelgate. Rose Law Firm billing records. Cattle Futures. Lincoln Bedroom. Missing White House furniture. Leaving the White House “broke” and emerging a Top One Percenter, worth hundreds of millions without building a thing but instead selling access and influence to government contracts and regulations, while delivering 15-minute backroom “speeches” at $225,000 a pop to Wall Street insiders.

So now I suddenly am supposed to care that Trump was caught on a microphone eleven years ago saying disgusting things? We already knew he is a serial womanizer, just as we know that Clinton has been a sex abuser for decades. Clinton may have avoided microphones, but the dress was stained. Frankly, I expect more Trump tapes and videos. I was wondering why they had not yet been leaked. The leakers were waiting for October. If I were voting for schoolteacher I would care. If I were voting for rabbi, pastor, priest, or imam I would care. But I am voting for something else -- the Federal Judiciary and the America our Founding Fathers envisioned.

Here is what I care about. I care about the economy and that we have not had a proper recovery from the Great Recession of eight years ago. I care that the Clinton “reset” with Putin has led to Russia seizing the Crimea, threatening the Ukraine, reestablishing Russian dominance in the Middle East, and staring down the American president and his useless secretary of state. I care about the safety and security of Israel and the insanity of the Iran Deal that has given the world’s leading state sponsor of terrorism $150 billion to finance murder of Americans and terror against the West, all while positioning Iran to threaten the entire world with nuclear weapons soon enough. I care about police in our cities being attacked and killed, and about African Americans being denied what I have: a life of hope for personal economic opportunity, safe streets, children getting fabulously educated for the new era, and an equality that the Democrats repeatedly have promised people of color but repeatedly have failed to deliver. I care about bringing back jobs and repatriating the trillions of dollars now reposing overseas because of our broken tax system. I care about securing our nation’s borders in an era where terrorists have disrupted life in democracies throughout Europe and controlling those borders to keep out crime and illicit drugs that are scourging our nation. And I care about the federal judiciary.

The United States Supreme Court is on the line. The United States Courts of Appeal, in federal appellate circuit after circuit, are on the line. The federal district judges -- the trial judges who hear federal cases in the first instance -- are on the line. As we have been losing the judiciary like crazy, we get rulings that increasingly challenge our country’s core values. Legitimate efforts to assure honest voting, honest voter registration, get overturned. The shame of very late term partial-birth abortion becomes legally possible. Our nation’s immigration laws are at jeopardy. Defiant “sanctuary cities” become multiplied. Even America’s most core values, including First Amendment assurances that government not interfere with religion and Second Amendment protections, are at risk.

So I do not care what Trump said eleven years ago. I do not care a whit about his 1995 taxes of eleven years ago. If he lost a ton of money then, it helps explain how he grew to be so successful -- he learned from those mistakes that there are limits to risk-taking. I like that. I do not care if he never pays income taxes again. Almost half the country does not pay taxes. If he is cheating, he will be caught and punished; by contrast, if he is not paying because the law allows him to use deductions, then he is no different from every other responsible taxpayer. It is proper to use every legal tax deduction available. That is why there are investment advisors, financial planners, and tax attorneys -- to help their fabulously wealthy clients avoid paying taxes. Liberals do it. Hollywood, Broadway, Wall Street, the Clintons, and Harry Reid do it. So why can’t Trump?

So I do not care about Trump’s filthy mouth and taxes of eleven years ago. In voting for Trump, I actually am not voting for Trump at all. Rather, I am voting for the federal judiciary, whose lifetime-appointed judges will direct the course of this country’s trajectory and values for the next quarter century. ObamaCare proved that a Democrat Congress, and even a Republican majority Congress, will not control a Democrat president. After thirty years, we know exactly the mess that Hillary Clinton will bring. By contrast, the Republicans have proven they will stand up to Trump if he exceeds bounds. He won’t. I am casting my vote for the federal judiciary and for the America that our Founding Fathers envisioned. The ballot I cast will say “Trump.”

100581,1008,Forget Tawdry Trump or Lyin' Hillary: Vote for the Party Platform,http://www.americanthinker.com/articles/2016/10/forget_tawdry_trump_or_lyin_hillary_vote_for_the_party_platform.html,21,"It would bring me no sorrow to awaken tomorrow and find that Donald Trump had withdrawn as the GOP's candidate in the race for President of the United States, replaced by Ted Cruz or Marco Rubio or Scott Walker or Bobby Jindal – even Mitt Romney – or nearly any other lukewarm body who has, in the last two decades, been at least as conservative as Keith Olbermann.  (It seems Hillary's team feared such a list.)

I never was the least bit surprised to hear a decade-old recording of a biblically illiterate, adulterous, strip club-owning presidential candidate do his best imitation of someone corrupted by liberalism. (One of the first things I said to my wife after hearing Trump's vulgar comments: ""He sounds like a liberal!"")  However, unlike many conservatives – especially Christian conservatives – I never declared myself ""NeverTrump."" And (like the highly regarded Dr. Michael Brown) I'm still not.  However, I've also not committed to voting for Trump.

Nevertheless, I'm as certain as any human being can be that the next president of the United States is going to be Donald Trump or Hillary Clinton.  If that is still the case when it comes time to cast my ballot, I almost certainly will vote for Mr. Trump.

As Franklin Graham said after the Trump video was released:

The only hope for the United States is God. Our nation's many sins have permeated our society, leading us to where we are today. But as Christians we can't back down from our responsibility to remain engaged in the politics of our nation. On November 8th we will all have a choice to make. The two candidates have very different visions for the future of America. The most important issue of this election is the Supreme Court. That impacts everything. There's no question, Trump and Clinton scandals might be news for the moment, but who they appoint to the Supreme Court will remake the fabric of our society for our children and our grandchildren, for generations to come. 

One of the few things Mr. Trump has impressed me with is the two lists of potential Supreme Court nominees he's released.  How much Mr. Trump can be trusted actually to nominate a candidate from these lists is a matter worth weighing.

Another matter worth weighing: the platform of the Republican Party vs. that of the Democratic Party.  Again, I'm not sure how much Donald Trump can be trusted to govern according to the soundly conservative platform of his (current) party – as another recently concluded, it's likely Trump is merely renting out the Republican Party in pursuit of his ambitions.  However, I know I can trust Hillary to govern according the radically liberal platform of her party.

When it comes to which candidate to choose come election time, a considerable amount of attention should be paid to the platform of the political party the candidate represents.  I long ago (in my twenties) abandoned the silly notion of ""voting for the person"" and not for the party.

The party matters because the platform of the party matters.  Many a modern ""Blue Dog Democrat"" has capitulated (remember Bart Stupak and Obamacare?) to the extreme liberalism of their party leaders (who determine the party platform).  (Tellingly, Stupak voted with his party 96 percent of the time.)  Older history provides a great lesson here.

As The Miracle and Magnificence of America reveals, in the middle of the nineteenth century, the anti-slavery platform of the newly formed Republican Party played no small role in the formation of the Confederate States of America.  Every party platform since the creation of the Republican Party had forcefully denounced slavery.  After the infamous Dred Scott ruling by the U.S. Supreme Court in 1857, the subsequent Republican platform strongly condemned the ruling and reaffirmed the right of Congress to ban slavery in the territories.  The corresponding Democrat platform praised the Dred Scott ruling and condemned all efforts to end slavery in the U.S.

Throughout its secession document, South Carolina, the first state to secede from the U.S., repeatedly declared that it was leaving the U.S. in order to preserve the institution of slavery.

[A]n increasing hostility on the part of the non-slaveholding [i.e., northern] states to the institution of slavery has led to a disregard of their obligations. ... [T]hey have denounced as sinful the institution of slavery. ... They have encouraged and assisted thousands of our slaves to leave their homes [through the Underground Railroad]. ... A geographical line has been drawn across the Union, and all the states north of that line have united in the election of a man to the high office of President of the United States [Abraham Lincoln] whose opinions and purposes are hostile to slavery.

""They"" in the secession document refers to the Republican Party.  The first GOP platform did not use the word ""sin,"" but instead declared polygamy and slavery ""those twin relics of barbarism.""  (Imagine that!  An implied reference to marriage as the union of one man and one woman in the very first Republican platform!)

Like every other state to secede, my home state of Georgia (the fifth state to leave the U.S.) also cited the election of Lincoln and the Republican Party:

A brief history of the rise, progress, and policy of anti-slavery and the political organization into whose hands the administration of the federal government has been committed [the republicans] will fully justify the pronounced verdict of the people of Georgia [who voted to secede]. The party of Lincoln, called the Republican Party under its present name and organization, is of recent origin. It is admitted to be an anti-slavery party[.]

In 1816, George Bourne, a renowned minister and abolitionist, published The Book and Slavery Irreconcilable, which ""dealt at length with individual texts of Scripture, even as it leaned even harder on what Bourne obviously considered the humanitarian agreement of biblical and republican principles.""  Bourne (rightly) considered slavery a sin and questioned whether those who owned slaves should be considered Christians.

Bourne wrote:

Every man who holds Slaves and who pretends to be a Christian or a Republican, is either an incurable Idiot who cannot distinguish good from evil, or an obdurate sinner who resolutely defies every social, moral, and divine requisition. ... Every ramification of the doctrine, that one rational creature can become the property of another, is totally repugnant to the rule of equity, the rights of nature, and the existence of civil society.

The same argument that Bourne made regarding slavery can easily be made regarding abortion, homosexuality, and a perverse redefinition of marriage.  For example, substitute ""holds Slaves"" with ""supports abortion,"" and then substitute ""that one rational creature can become the property of another"" with ""that a child in the womb is a mere 'choice.'""  And like slavery, abortion, homosexuality, promiscuity, and a perverse redefinition of marriage are ""totally repugnant to the rule of equity, the rights of nature, and the existence of civil society.""

The 2016 Republican Party Platform has been hailed as ""the most pro-life, pro-family ever.""  On the contrary, as was the case with slavery, for decades now the platform of the modern Democratic Party has been dedicated to preserving the ""right"" to kill children in the womb.  Add to that the commitment modern Democrats have to undermining what God has revealed on sex, marriage, and the family, and it should be clear to any truth-loving American that the modern Democratic Party must be opposed at every turn.  This will certainly be true come November 8.

100582,1008,GOP: The Bastion of Piety,http://www.americanthinker.com/articles/2016/10/gop_the_bastion_of_piety.html,21,"Trump’s 2005 hot mic scandal is an example of why the GOP always loses to Democrats. This is a perfect illustration of how the GOP leaders run for cover while Democrats unify for the good of their agenda.

Instead of rallying behind the party candidate, GOP leaders would rather promote their own personal pride and moral high ground. Division like that does not win presidential campaigns. The GOP has always had a chronic case of “it’s all about me” as opposed to “it’s all about us.”

What did we learn on October 7, 2016? Did we learn that Trump is attracted to beautiful women? Nope! He was married to three supermodels and had kids by all three. Did we learn that Trump ogles women and uses vulgar language? Nope! What heterosexual red-blooded American man has not done this in the past among friends? Did we learn that the most pious of the GOP have never ogled a woman or made a crude comment? Yes! Apparently, Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell and House Speaker Paul Ryan have never uttered a foul word about a “hot babe” to a friend or colleague. Further, many leaders in the GOP have never done it either because they are all chastising Trump for his lewd comments.

Let us examine for a moment Hillary’s email scandal, FBI investigations, Benghazi, and multiple congressional investigations (not to mention her husband’s scandals). Through them all, Democrats circled the wagons and protected their own. This is why they win. The agenda, the party, it is all bigger than one person. When Hillary Clinton says “Stronger Together”, she is not referring to the American people. No! She is referring to the Democrat Party.

Clinton’s email scandal, according to FBI Director James Comey’s own words, put national secrets at risk. Not even her fiercest rival in this Democratic Primary race, Bernie Sanders, would speak ill of her. In fact, in the first Democrat debate with Anderson Cooper, Sanders said, ""I think the Secretary is right, and that is, I think the American people are sick and tired of hearing about your damn emails."" Hillary smiled and thanked him… the crowd roared with approval. Even at his own peril, Sanders helped sweep under the rug what might hurt the party.

As First Lady Michelle Obama campaigns for Hillary, not a word is mentioned in the media or among democrat pundits how Michelle Obama said that Hillary was unfit to run the White House. At a 2007 campaign event in Chicago, Ms. Obama said, “If you can’t run your own house, you can’t run the White House.” But that was then and this is now. In 2016, Hillary is the anointed one and President Obama and Michelle are on record as saying, “there is no one more qualified for the presidency than Hillary Clinton.”  Rally the troops, circle the wagons, and never ever show dissension in the party ranks!

When it comes to the Republican Party… dissension is their middle name! Trump used foul language… Trump ogled a woman… Trump made reference to what he would like to do to that attractive woman… Compared to what Hillary has done, this is minor. But according to several GOP leaders, this is unforgiveable and Trump should drop out of the race. All because the moral high ground is more important than winning the White House. You cannot win in politics if the moral high ground is more important than the party’s agenda.

GOP leaders should have silenced their party while privately recommending that Trump issue an apology. Americans are quick to forgive. Then, the morning after the apology, GOP leaders could hit the talk show circuit pointing to the apology and urging Americans to focus on the pillars of the campaign, border security, rebuilding the military, law and order, reducing taxes, and reducing regulations. That is what should be the focus of this election season, not some lewd comment that Trump made 11 years ago. What difference -- at this point, what difference does it make? (Sound familiar?)

Unfortunately, they chose a different path, breaking the cardinal rule… never show dissension. To quote Godfather Vito Corleone to his son Santino, “Never tell anybody outside the family what you are thinking.”  The Democrats live by this commandment. The GOP, on the other hand, breaks this rule with predictable regularity. Until they learn the lesson, they are destined to lose battle upon battle.

Advice to Mr. Trump: disavow Republican leaders. Paint them as part of the problem in Washington, the establishment that is against you. Remind us that you are the outsider that will finally make a difference because you are not owned or controlled by anyone with a political agenda greater than “Make America Great Again!”

100583,1009,THE LIBERAL MEDIA’S PERPETUAL SMEAR CAMPAIGN,http://www.powerlineblog.com/archives/2016/10/the-liberal-medias-perpetual-smear-campaign.php,21,"Today’s news is dominated by claims that years ago, Donald Trump made crude comments about women, or inappropriately touched women, or intruded into a women’s dressing room, and so on. Gone from the campaign are such issues as the economy, Obamacare, national security and immigration. As Election Day approaches, the news is all Trump scandals, all the time.

Some will say–I may have said–that Republican primary voters asked for it by nominating a man with obvious personal vulnerabilities, instead of a more upright (and more electable) Marco Rubio, John Kasich, Ted Cruz or whoever.

But what’s a Republican to do? Last cycle, we nominated the ultimate Boy Scout: Mitt Romney. Whatever you think of Romney from a policy perspective, he is as admirable a man as you will ever meet. To find a presidential candidate of better moral character, you probably have to go back to Abraham Lincoln and George Washington. Romney never said a rude word about a woman in his life.

So what happened? Did Romney and the GOP get credit in the press for the candidates’s outstanding character? No. Romney, who helped to create tens of thousands of jobs at Bain Capital, was denounced as a “vulture capitalist” and blamed, absurdly, for one woman’s developing cancer. The Washington Post made a front page story of the fact that 50 years earlier, when he was in high school, he and others had cut a classmate’s hair. Oh, and Romney was a racist, too. Does anyone remember why? I don’t.

The cycle before that, GOP voters nominated John McCain. McCain is a great patriot, a man of extraordinary character and courage who survived years of torture and abuse as a prisoner of war in Vietnam. Did the liberal media give Republicans credit for nominating such a hero? No. The New York Times, to its everlasting shame, peddled a false rumor that McCain had an affair with a lobbyist. (Bill Clinton would have done that before breakfast.) It also berated McCain for failing to release his medical records–which, actually, he did, unlike Bill Clinton and Barack Obama.

The Left’s permanent smear campaign against conservatives doesn’t just extend to Republican presidential candidates. Recall how the Democrat/media complex treated the Tea Party. Prominent House Democrats lied, disgracefully: they claimed, falsely, that Tea Party activists at a protest in Washington had hurled racial insults at black Democrats like John Lewis. The press ate it up. They printed the Democrats’ lies as facts, and to this day reporters and editors have never corrected the libel, even though a $100,000 prize to anyone who could substantiate the Democrats’ lies went unclaimed.

What’s the point? I’m not really sure. I certainly am not in favor of nominating candidates of poor or marginal character. But the hypocrisy of the liberal media is galling. In this election cycle, lewd comments made decades ago are apparently of earth-shattering importance. Really? Where was that standard when Bill Clinton was running for office? Or John Kennedy? Or Lyndon Johnson? And how about Barack Obama and Joe Biden? Has anyone actually investigated to see what they might have said about women over the last thirty years?

What is the point of nominating someone of extraordinary moral stature, like Mitt Romney, if the political press will not only unanimously refuse to acknowledge the fact, but worse, join in a campaign of deception to smear Romney in the eyes of voters?

These days there is lots of gnashing of teeth over the decline of our political culture. And it surely has declined, as manifested in the current presidential campaign. But one must ask, why has that happened? It seems to me that the media’s permanent smear campaign against the Republican Party, waged cycle after cycle regardless of the actual merits of Republican nominees, is the largest part of the answer."

O’Keefe recorded Feingold, the former senator who is running against Republican incumbent Ron Johnson in Wisconsin, suggesting that as president Hillary Clinton would use executive orders to limit gun rights. The hostess of the event added that Hillary “wants to shut it down,” “it” being private ownership of handguns, and “get guns away from everyone in this country.” She also mentioned imposing a limit on the number of bullets a citizen can purchase as a possible avenue of circumventing the Second Amendment. Here is the video: The video’s release should hurt Feingold in Wisconsin, a strong gun rights state. By rights, it should hurt Hillary Clinton, too, if the news leaks out. But that would require the press to cover something other than what Donald Trump said or did ten or twenty years ago.

This is a good time for a reminder that Ron Johnson is one of this year’s Power Line Picks. His seat is very much in jeopardy, and if Feingold wins, he may well be the most left-wing member of the Senate. We urge you to contribute to Johnson campaign here."
100585,1009,“STRONGER TOGETHER” UNDER HILLARY CLINTON? I DON’T THINK SO,http://www.powerlineblog.com/archives/2016/10/stronger-together-under-hillary-clinton-i-dont-think-so.php,21,"“Stronger together” is Hillary Clinton’s campaign slogan. Like most of what comes out of Hillary’s mouth, it is insincere. Clinton has written off approximately 20 percent of the American public as deplorable and irredeemable. Her top aides express contempt for traditional Catholics, evangelicals, and Jews who support Israel.

But let’s look beyond the inevitable Clinton insincerity and ask whether, under a Hillary presidency, America would be stronger together.

We must first ask what makes America strong. I believe there are four main elements.

First, America must have a strong military. Second, America must have a shared belief that it is great, and not just “because it is good.” Third, America must hold its citizens to high standards of personal conduct. Fourth, America must be a meritocracy and must judge merit without regard to extraneous factors such as race, ethnicity, and gender.

Would an America unified behind Hillary Clinton’s left-liberal leadership and vision satisfy these requirement? I don’t think so.

First, America’s military is in steep decline under President Obama. Marco Rubio laid out some of the sorry details here. In all likelihood, this decline would continue under Hillary Clinton.

Second, Hillary Clinton’s stated position on American greatness is that “America is great because it is good.” Coming from Hillary, this tired phrase is code for the claim that American greatness depends on policies such as open borders and liberal largess.

The real left-liberal view of American greatness is even more disturbing. It holds that America is anything but great. Political leaders like Bill Clinton and Barack Obama have manifested this view by running around the world apologizing for American foreign policy.

Meanwhile, under the guidance of left-liberal intellectuals, the rejection of American greatness has become the organizing principle behind a new way of teaching of American history to top high schools students.

Can America be great if it teaches students that it isn’t even good?

Third, Hillary Clinton and her fellow left-liberals want to hold Americans to lower standards of personal conduct than those currently embodied in the criminal law. They want to release criminals, set lower sentences, and decriminalize certain conduct. They also want to impose substantially less discipline on disruptive students.

Their main argument in favor of these measures is that certain segments of the population bear a “disproportionate” burden as a result of current standards. Thus, they want standards lowered because some groups have difficulty adhering to them. Such laxity won’t make America stronger; it will weaken us.

Finally, Hillary Clinton and her fellow left-liberals oppose a meritocracy in which merit is judged without regard to factors like race, ethnicity, and gender. Instead, they favor a spoils system in which a share of rewards — e.g. admission to college and accession to jobs — is set aside for African-Americans, Latinos, and (where necessary) females. This system produces a lowering of quality and a sense of entitlement antithetical to a strong America.

For these reasons, America won’t be “stronger together” under Hillary Clinton’s leadership. Rather, it will be stronger if those who oppose the left-liberal policies and viewpoints described above maintain a status apart. That way, we can uphold a vision of what a strong America truly is like and, as Hillary’s America begins to unravel, perhaps persuade a critical mass of Americans of the soundness of our vision."
100586,1010,24 hours illustrating why Trump is a threat to press freedom,https://thinkprogress.org/trump-threat-to-press-freedom-committee-to-protect-journalists-eddc2e6d4270#.sgaztn400,21,"In the hours since a number of women stepped forward to accuse Donald Trump of sexual assault on Wednesday, Trump has vowed to sue the New York Times for reporting two of the women’s stories and smeared journalists at a rally.
Speaking publicly for the first time since the new allegations emerged, Trump told supporters at his Florida rally on Thursday, “The corporate media in our country is no longer involved in journalism. They are [a] political special interest.” Trump’s speech came after campaign surrogate Rudy Giuliani broadsided the media for reporting on the Trump allegations during his own speech. It also inspired rally attendees to lash out at reporters covering the event.
 This isn’t the first time journalists have been the targets of vitriol from Trump rally attendees.
Trump’s threat to press freedoms
Around the same time Trump was smearing the media, the Committee to Protect Journalists (CPJ) declared Trump to be a threat to press freedoms throughout the world.
In an move unprecedented in the CPJ’s 35-year history, the nonprofit organization released a statement on Thursday that says, “Trump, through his words and actions as a candidate for president of the United States, has consistently betrayed First Amendment values.”
“Since the beginning of his candidacy, Trump has insulted and vilified the press and has made his opposition to the media a centerpiece of his campaign,” the statement, attributed to CPJ chairman Sandra Mims Rowe, continues. “Trump has routinely labeled the press as ‘dishonest’ and ‘scum’ and singled out individual news organizations and journalists.”
Mims Rowe’s statement goes on to cite a number of examples of Trump mocking, insulting, and expelling journalists from events. Many of them are included in this CNN compilation of Trump smearing the media. The statement then mentions oft-repeated threats to sue media outlets when they cover him unfavorably, citing his vow in February to “open up our libel laws so when they write purposely negative and horrible and false articles, we can sue them and win lots of money.” The New York Times’ lawyers, for what it’s worth, said Thursday they aren’t worried about Trump potentially suing the paper for its reporting on the sexual assault allegations.
But the CPJ isn’t just concerns about the impact a President Trump could have on press freedoms at home.
“A Trump presidency would represent a threat to press freedom in the United States, but the consequences for the rights of journalists around the world could be far more serious,” Mims Rowe writes. “Any failure of the United States to uphold its own standards emboldens dictators and despots to restrict the media in their own countries. This appears to be of no concern to Trump, who indicated that he has no inclination to challenge governments on press freedom and the treatment of journalists.”
Indeed, Trump has praised Russian strongman Vladimir Putin, calling the man presiding over a country where opposition leaders and journalists have been killed under mysterious circumstances “highly respected within his own country and beyond.”
“For this reason CPJ is taking the unprecedented step of speaking out now. This is not about picking sides in an election,” the CPJ statement concludes. “This is recognizing that a Trump presidency represents a threat to press freedom unknown in modern history.”"

But First Lady Michelle Obama delivered a campaign speech that was far from typical.
Obama was there to talk about Donald Trump’s history of sexual harassment, the scope and magnitude of which is still only just coming to light. Allegations against the failed businessman stretch back decades, but the public’s first real glimpse into the depths of Trump’s depravity came last week, when tapes of him recounting the times he would approach women and “grab them by the pussy” were surfaced by the Washington Post. Since then, multiple women have come forward with stories of their run-ins with Trump behind closed doors and away from prying eyes.
“We saw this candidate actually bragging about sexually assaulting women. And I can’t believe that I’m saying that. A candidate for president of the United States has bragged about sexually assaulting women. And I have to tell you, I can’t stop thinking about this,” said Obama. “It has shaken me to my core in a way that I couldn’t have predicted. So while I’d love nothing more than to pretend like this isn’t happening, and to come out here and do my normal campaign speech, it would be dishonest and disingenuous of me to just move on to the next thing like this was all just a bad dream.”
Instead, Obama offered perhaps the strongest condemnation of Trump’s misogyny to date, and contrasted his appetite for sexual assault with the historic candidacy of Hillary Clinton_—_all without calling him out by name. “It now seems very clear that this isn’t an isolated incident. It’s one of countless examples of how he has treated women his whole life, and I have to tell you, I listen to all of this and I feel it so personally,” she said. “And I’m sure that many of you do to, particularly the women. The shameful comments about our bodies, the disrespect of our ambitions and intellect, the belief that you can do anything you want to a women: It is cruel. It is frightening. And the truth is, it hurts.”
Obama also addressed some of the reaction following the release of the Trump tapes. In the days since they were made public, Trump campaign officials and thousands of his sexist supporters have lashed out at Trump’s accusers, attacking their credibility and even their physical appearance. After a hypothetical poll was circulated that showed Trump winning in a landslide if women weren’t allowed to vote, Trump supporters began tweeting with the hashtag #RepealThe19th.
“We thought all of that was ancient history, didn’t we? And so many have worked for so many years to end this kind of violence and abuse and disrespect, but here we are,” said Obama. “We are drowning in it. And all of us are doing what women have always done: we’re trying to keep our heads above water…Maybe because we think that admitting that how much it hurts makes us as women look weak. Maybe we’re afraid to be that vulnerable. Maybe we’ve grown accustomed to swallowing these emotions and staying quiet, because we’ve seen that people often won’t take our word over his.” Michelle Obama’s comments were perhaps the most powerful rejection of the Trump brand of sexism to date, but hardly the first. Republicans like Ana Navarro have also lambasted Trump and his supporters for their anti-women rhetoric, as have everyday voters like Marybeth Glenn, a conservative woman whose epic Tweet storm calling out Republicans who have refused to distance themselves from Trump set the internet aflame.
Michelle Obama has emerged as one of Hillary Clinton’s most effective surrogates, energizing crowds at the DNC last summer and again on Thursday. The image of the country’s first black First Lady on stage in support of the first female presidential candidate was thrown into sharp relief when, moments after Obama’s speech ended, the networks cut to Donald Trump, who proceeded to attack his accusers as ugly and untrustworthy."
100588,1010,Here’s why Trump’s accusers waited until now to come forward,https://thinkprogress.org/trump-victims-come-forward-694740ab44b3#.dttpgw9br,21,"The floodgates have opened. After a video emerged last week of Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump describing how he could get away with sexually assaulting women because of his fame, more and more women are coming forward to recount their stories of experiencing this very behavior.
But the women are already being met with a common myth that victims of harassment and abuse often face: that they should have spoken out earlier, and the fact that they didn’t means they’re lying.
Before this week, a number of women had already publicly discussed being assaulted by Trump, alleging that he had groped and kissed them without their consent. Some of them have also filed charges. A 1997 lawsuit filed against Trump alleges that he groped and attempted to rape makeup artist Jill Harth after a business meeting at Mar-a-Lago.
But last night, a number of additional women shared their stories for the first time with a range of media outlets. Jessica Leeds told the New York Times that Trump groped her on an airplane in the 1980s. Rachel Crooks said in the same article that Trump kissed her on the mouth against her will in 2005 when she was a receptionist working in Trump Tower. Mindy McGillivray recounted for the Palm Beach Post an experience in 2003 when she says Trump grabbed her buttocks when she was working on a photo shoot at Mar-a-Lago. And People Magazine reporter Natasha Stoynoff wrote about Trump pushing her up against a wall and forcibly kissing her in 2005.
In response, some Trump defenders are trying to cast doubt on these women’s stories by wondering why they didn’t say anything about what they experienced back when it happened.
On Wednesday night AJ Delgado, a senior adviser to the Trump campaign, went on MSNBC’s All In with Chris Hayes and said, “These allegations are decades old. If somebody actually did that, Chris, any reasonable woman would have come forward and said something at the time.” That narrative carried through into the morning. On Thursday, MSNBC host Joe Scarborough said he was “skeptical” of the timing of these stories, saying he would have come forward earlier. “If I had been sexually harassed by this man, the Megyn Kelly story would have given me an opportunity, there have been a thousand of the reports already.”
Trump himself lashed out at one the women on Twitter with the same argument: But staying silent about harassment and abuse is the most common response among victims of these crimes. It’s not hard to see why.
In a landmark report on harassment in the workplace, the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission found that only somewhere between 6 and 13 percent of victims file a formal complaint, while less than a third talk about it with a manager or union representative. The vast majority_—_nearly three-quarters_—_say nothing at all. “The least common response to harassment is to take some formal action_—_either to report the harassment internally or file a formal legal complaint,” the report says.
The most common explanations victims give for staying quiet is that they fear they won’t be believed, nothing will come of speaking up, or that they will face retaliation for doing so. That last fear has frequently come to pass: One study found that three-quarters of employees who spoke out about abuse faced retaliation.
This dynamic is even more difficult to overcome if the perpetrator holds a position of power, as Trump did in all of these instances. “If the person who is harassing you is someone who is really important not just in your company but in your industry, you have to worry not only will this make it impossible for me to continue to work here, but…what kind of black mark am I putting by my name by speaking up,” Emily Martin, vice president for workplace justice at the National Women’s Law Center, previously told ThinkProgress.
That’s what some of these women say kept them quiet. “I was afraid that a famous, powerful, wealthy man could and would discredit and destroy me,” People’s Stoynoff said. Crooks’ boyfriend at the time, Clint Hackenburg, recalled that she had the same reaction. “She felt like she couldn’t do anything to him because of his position,” he told the Times. “She was 22. She was a secretary. It was her first job out of college. I remember her saying, ‘I can’t do anything to this guy, because he’s Donald Trump.”
There’s also not much in it for victims to come forward. A big payday is extremely rare: federal sexual harassment damages are capped at $300,000, and the median settlement is just $30,000. And that’s if a victim has the time and resources to bring a case and is able to prevail in what is often a case of her word against her abuser’s.
What may finally be making women feel safe enough to come forward is the power of their numbers. Abuse and harassment can be isolating experiences; that changes if women see other victims describing the very same behavior they themselves endured. And it certainly helps that Trump himself has been caught on tape describing his own predatory actions."
100589,1001,Trump's implosion casts dark shadow over wonder boy Paul Ryan's once charmed political path,http://www.dailykos.com/stories/2016/10/14/1582396/-Trump-s-implosion-casts-dark-shadow-over-wonder-boy-Paul-Ryan-s-once-charmed-political-path,22,"After first getting elected at 29, gaining national exposure as a vice presidential candidate and landing the House speakership by 45, Paul Ryan's luck may be running dry. Now that Donald Trump is determined to go down in a blaze of glory with the entire Republican party shackled to his side, the question is: Will Ryan survive?

Depending on what happens to the House majority, Ryan's options range from abysmal to meh. But none of them bode particularly well for the presidential bid he surely harbors in his heart.

The worst option by a long shot: Republicans maintain a slim House majority. Politico writes:

The rabble-rousing Freedom Caucus will make up a larger percentage of a diminished conference, which could push the House GOP to the right as the rest of Washington lurches to the left.
Not only would Ryan have to claw in order to amass the 218 votes to continue leading the caucus, that job would be even more thankless than it's been since 2010. If Ryan wants to pass any bills through the House that have even a chance of becoming law, he'll need to attract Democratic votes and will simultaneously be eviscerated by a newly energized crazy caucus.

Wanna help rip the gavel from Paul Ryan’s hands? Give 1$ to each of our 14 House endorsees today!

Do you live in a state that will determine the presidential race and/or who controls the Senate? Get involved this weekend in crucial door-to-door canvasses and phone banks.

Then there's just hanging up the reins altogether and not running for re-election. Ryan and his wife are reportedly worth at least $3 million. So he retires from Congress to become a lobbyist or lead a think tank or some such. He could conceivably build a presidential resume by leaving Congress but it's certainly not the norm.

And then there's continuing to lead a GOP caucus that's in the minority, which could perhaps be the most satisfying option for him, if not the best launch pad for the White House.

Ryan's own predilection is toward incremental progress. His minority would likely consist of 200-odd votes, which would give him a strong hand in negotiations with President Hillary Clinton and Pelosi. [...] Think small-bore corporate tax reform or modest entitlement tweaks, or something of that nature, in return for a boost in infrastructure spending. That's a deal Ryan could cut."
100590,1001,Donald Trump has been abusing and gaslighting women for decades,http://www.dailykos.com/stories/2016/10/14/1582332/-Donald-Trump-has-been-abusing-and-gaslighting-women-for-decades#read-more,22,"After a People magazine reporter came forward to tell about having been assaulted by Donald Trump, Trump blew off the allegation by saying “Look at her.” In one more act of gaslighting, his campaign claims he didn’t mean to imply the woman was too ugly to sexually assault, but in case there was any doubt, here’s Trump in 1994:

So why in 1992 did you tell a writer for New York magazine, Marie Brenner, that ‘You have to treat women like shit” — ultimately pouring a bottle of wine down her back?

I didn’t say that. The woman’s a liar, extremely unattractive, lots of problems because of her looks.
Look at that. The same basic play: I didn’t do or say what that reporter reported, and you shouldn’t believe her because she’s ugly. Isn’t it interesting how Trump often changes his policy positions in the course of a single speech or interview, but his character has remained the same for decades?

And who could think this man would mistreat women?

That statement is exactly why women think you’re a chauvinist pig.

They’re right — and not. People say, ""How can you say such a thing?"" but there’s a truth in it, in a modified form. Psychologists will tell you that some women want to be treated with respect, others differently. I tell friends who treat their wives magnificently, get treated like crap in return, “Be rougher and you’ll see a different relationship.’ Unfortunately, with people in general, you get more with vinegar than honey.
What a truly horrific human being. Who will likely get 60 million votes for president of the United States. It’s appalling."

Here's a glimpse of his Thursday night rally in Ohio from Sahil Kapur:

“The problem is not that all Republicans think the way this guy does. The problem is that they’ve been riding this tiger for a long time. They’ve been feeding their base all kinds of crazy for years, primarily for political expedience.”
Obama's new take on the Republican “swamp of crazy” that has led to Donald Trump's ascension may seem obvious to most progressives, who have watched the GOP dumb down its voters for decades. But it signifies a new phase of this campaign. The president’s widely praised convention speech made the purposeful case that Trump was a three-headed freak show with little relation to conservatism. But that was when Democrats were trolling for votes in a sea of squeamish, if not repulsed, conservative voters.

Now that a clearer path to a Democratic White House has emerged, the president has taken more of ""let me tell how I really feel"" approach to the campaign trail.  

Frustrated you don't live in a swing state? No matter where you live, MoveOn has a great way for you to get involved where it matters most. Check it out!

Greg Sargent writes: 

Obama accused Republicans of relentlessly feeding a “swamp of crazy,” adding that they looked the other way while many base voters descended into delusions about Obama himself (birtherism) and about his presidency (claiming he founded ISIS and wanted to take away everyone’s guns).

Obama noted that GOP lawmakers had a choice — they could have differed with him on the issues while simultaneously telling their voters a more balanced story about the Obama years. Instead, Obama suggested, they decided it was their interests to keep the base as riled up as possible, so they looked the other way while the conspiracy-mongering took deep root.
He’s also admonishing GOP candidates like Ohio Sen. Rob Portman, currently leading his Senate race against Ted Strickland, who ""stood by"" while this toxic brew percolated. The implicit message to voters: It's not good enough to split your ticket. If you can't vote for Trump, you can't vote for the people who made Trump possible. They are one in the same.

Obama pounded home the point again at another Ohio rally Friday."
100592,1002,Lolita Zinke: This Election Is About Big Issues,http://www.breitbart.com/2016-presidential-race/2016/10/14/lolita-zinke-this-election-is-about-big-issues/,22,"I believe in the power of strong female leadership. I’m a pro-military, pro-equal pay, pro-Second Amendment, pro-immigration, and pro-business Hispanic woman voting for Donald Trump. Hillary Clinton is not a strong leader. Blindly voting for Clinton because she happens to be a woman does not prove feminist bonafides. For me, it would go against everything my husband and I have stood for: love of family, strength of our local community, and defense of our country.
I have seen my husband get dragged through the mud and called every name in the book by cowards on Twitter and in the opinion pages. I’ve been criticized myself by the left because they cannot comprehend or respect a woman choosing to vote for Mr. Trump. Because I choose to reject the decades of lies and corruption of Hillary Clinton and her husband’s sordid past, I’ve been called uneducated, (I have a law degree by the way), a puppet (I actually urged Ryan to support Trump), a disgrace to women, and so many more things that are not fit to print. The intolerance of the modern Democratic Party is a far cry from the Democratic Party I used to support as an independent voter.

Let me tell you why I do support Mr. Trump. I’m a wife, daughter, mom and grandma, and I love our country. Like our daughter and granddaughters, I care about what is going on around the world. When Ryan was deployed commanding troops in war, it was my job to keep morale up at home. Navy SEALs are more than colleagues, they are brothers. We are family. When Ty and Glenn died in Benghazi it shook our family. When Hillary Clinton lied about it, it was a slap in the face. When she criticized families for calling her out in it, it was un-American. As a military wife and mom, I will never support somebody who does not support the military.

Everyone knows my husband was a Navy SEAL for 23 years. I also have a daughter who is a Navy Diver and my son in law is an active duty SEAL. My youngest son is considering military service as well. Hillary Clinton will continue the dangerous foreign policy she and President Obama started and she will continue to put out troops in harms way with no plan. This will open us up to more casualties abroad and more terrorist attacks at home.

I’m a small business woman. I am also the mom of two college students who are about to face an economy that under Barack Obama and Hillary Clinton doesn’t have jobs for them. Nearly 13 percent – that’s the unemployment rate for millennials. Taxes, regulations, and economic conditions are important. I believe Trump’s business acumen will help build a stronger economy and he will surround himself with incredibly smart and successful individuals rather than career bureaucrats.

We all know Mr. Trump has said some regrettable things. He’s since apologized. I got over it. With everything that is going on in the world – Iran and North Korea flexing nuclear muscle, terrorist attacks in America, high unemployment with millennials – I think this election is about more than locker room talk.

100593,1002,Trump Campaign to John Podesta: Resign or Come Clean on Owning Shares in Putin-Connected Company,http://www.breitbart.com/big-government/2016/10/14/trump-campaign-john-podesta-resign-come-clean-owning-shares-putin-connected-company/,22,"The Donald Trump presidential campaign is demanding that Hillary Clinton’s campaign chairman John Podesta come clean about the details surrounding his membership on the executive board of an energy company, Joule Unlimited, which received millions from a Putin-connected Russian government fund and the “75,000 common shares” Podesta owned and had transferred to a holding company called Leonidio LLC.
“The disclosure that Clinton Chair John Podesta transferred his shares in Putin-backed Joule Unlimited to an anonymous holding company when he joined the Obama Administration is extremely concerning,” Donald Trump Senior Communications Advisor Jason Miller said in a statement. Podesta had failed to fully disclose his position on Joule Unlimited’s board of directors and include it in his federal financial disclosures, as required by law, before he became President Obama’s senior adviser in January 2014.

“Because the holding company is completely anonymous, we do not know whether or not he still has deep financial ties to Vladimir Putin and his regime,” Miller wrote. “As such, Mr. Podesta needs to either reveal who is behind the holding company or he must resign from the Clinton campaign immediately.”

The WikiLeaks hacks uncovered an email exchange under the subject “Podesta Outstanding Docs for Joule.” In the  email exchange, Eryn Sepp, who was an assistant to Podesta at the Center for American Progress, forwarded a message to Podesta from Mark C. Solakian, who was Senior Vice President and General Counsel at Joule Unlimited Technologies, Inc.

“It is my understanding that John transferred the resulting 75,000 common shares from the option exercise to the Leonidio LLC.,” Slovakian wrote in a January 2014 email, referencing the Delaware-based holding company. “As such, we would need to edit the Transfer of Share Agreement to reflect the transfer of 75,000 common shares to the LLC.”

Podesta’s membership on the board of directors of Joule Unlimited was first revealed in research from Breitbart News Senior Editor-at-Large and Government Accountability Institute (GAI) President Peter Schweizer.

In the GAI report, tilted, “From Russia with Money: Hillary Clinton, the Russian Reset, and Cronyism,” it is revealed that Podesta joined the Joule Unlimited board in June 2011.

Podesta has not commented on the revelations linking him to Putin and Russia-connected companies. But the longtime Democratic operative has publicly claimed that Russian spies hacked his email to influence the presidential election.

Clinton 2016,http://www.breitbart.com/2016-presidential-race/2016/10/14/nuclear-option-bush-vs-clinton-redux-2016/,22,"It was always going to be this way: Bush vs. Clinton 2016. From the very start, the media tried to rig this election to be a showdown between the Republican Party’s polite and uptight Bush clan and the Democratic Party’s shameless and self-serving Clinton mafia.

Only the Bush they had in mind — Jeb! — did not have the stamina to keep up with the exclamation point his campaign deployed to put a little pep in his step. The poor little punctuation mark hung like a sad, shriveled carrot, dangling there beyond the end of his name in hopes of spurring him toward dynastic destiny.

Some eight wild months after Jeb! finally surrendered and began a long nap, in swoops Billy Bush to rescue the dynasty by slaying the family’s greatest threat: a Republican NOT named Bush.

The Bush family motto has always been if not a Bush, then how about a Clinton? We’ve all heard how, on long, overnight plane trips together, Bubba gives Poppy the bed.

Oh, dear.

But, back to the tape. Listening to Mr. Bush enthusiastically encourage Mr. Trump’s vulgar and absurd approach to picking up women, it is clear that Mr. Bush needs no help from an exclamation point. He is so excited in the recording that he is practically panting as he trots alongside Mr. Trump as the billionaire lover dazzles with all his fantastical boasting.

But let’s be honest, in the locker room, there are talkers and there are doers. These are the words of a talker.

After playing the tape over and over and over, the media then sits up and screams, “Put the kids to bed!” Finally, they can caution parents to keep their children away from Donald Trump.

But have they forgotten what our children have already been exposed to in the great modern American political debate?

In September 1998, The Washington Post reported:

“A few hours before President Clinton began his videotaped grand jury testimony Aug. 17, the FBI laboratory informed Starr’s office that the president was the source of the DNA taken from Monica S. Lewinsky’s navy blue dress ‘to a reasonable degree of scientific certainty.’”

“Daddy, what is a DNA sample?” the child asks. “And how did it get onto her blue dress? What is an intern?”

Or about this gem from 1997:

“Mommy, what does ‘distinguishing characteristic’ mean? And how do you get Peyronie’s disease? What’s an affidavit?”

Seriously, people, you have dragged America’s children through far worse.

The question I still have is how is it possible that Mr. Bush and Mr. Trump could have been recorded saying such things and, for 11 years, NBC News took no action whatsoever against its reporter? Does NBC News, owner of the Access Hollywood program, condone such behavior and comments from their “on air talent”?

And when they finally decided to take action, did company officials actually discuss ways of releasing the tape of Mr. Trump’s comments while covering up for Mr. Bush?

And how long exactly did the company sit on the tape before dropping the bombshell “October surprise” just weeks before the election?

We won’t hold our breath waiting for answers to these questions.

But it all reminds us that it is beyond high time that we grab the Republican Party by the Bush and grab theDemocratic Party by the Clinton and toss them all out into the gutter where they belong."
100595,1003,How To Stop Violence In America: Managing Discomfort And Fear Are The Solution,http://www.huffingtonpost.com/marc-schoen-phd/how-to-stop-violence-in-america_b_12461360.html?utm_hp_ref=politics,22,"With the escalation of American violence, it is easy to blame the vast availability of guns as the only culprit. But is it enough to control the access to guns? Not likely. Clearly the availability of chemicals and technology for explosive devices, in addition to the myriad of other ways to create destruction and harm are here to stay. Building fences and sequestering cultures are not the answer as well. Although gun availability is undoubtedly a major contributing factor, sadly these issues are becoming increasingly reduced to empty, emotional rhetoric and rallying cries for politicians. Given the history of these issues, and particularly gun control in America, it is unlikely they will be settled anytime soon. Truly, it makes far more sense to move past these polarizing issues and instead focus our discussion on an actual solution that can unite all of us - one that both sides of the aisle can agree upon.

Guns, weapons, explosives, and other forms of destruction are merely symptoms of a more primary and central culprit that is at the heart of violence in America - our most primitive instinct. For the purposes of this discussion, I will refer to this as the survival instinct. Our survival instinct evolved for the purpose of keeping us out of danger, such as running from a charging lion or an incoming spear. Yet the very instinct that has allowed us to survive as a species through the millenniums, is the very gut response that is literally putting us in harm’s way. It is now fomenting what it was meant to avert. As civilization has advanced, humans have become increasingly less controlled by their most primitive instincts. Unfortunately, it appears that our progression as a species is stalling and regretfully, reverting to ancient times when our instincts were at the helm.

If we are truly interested in reversing America’s tide of self-destruction, then it is imperative to directly address the ever sensitive, hair trigger survival instinct. At the pulse of the precarious survival instinct is our growing inability to manage discomfort. Essentially, we are becoming insidiously less and less hardy in the face of stress, pressure, competition, disappointments, frustrations, and uncertainty. As our level of poorly managed discomfort elevates within us, the greater probability of the survival instinct will be triggered.

Discomfort is like an internal pressure cooker, where it starts out simmering, but left unattended can quickly reach a boiling point. The earliest stages of mismanaged discomfort are first noticeable as symptoms: poor sleep, rumination, compulsions, impatience, withdrawal, irritability, poor performance and decision making under pressure, stomach and head/back pain, and other forms of physical illness. In later stages, rising levels of unabated discomfort begins to materialize in the form of addictions, intolerance, self-righteousness, rage, hostility, and antisocial behavior.

Once discomfort has reached a boiling point, it develops a strong foothold, feeds on itself, becomes a ticking time bomb, looks for an escape hatch, and can explode at the slightest provocation. Intervening at such a late stage, as we are learning, does little to change the future. It’s like putting out a forest fire, which as we are learning, can set the stage for potentially bigger fires in the future. As long as the forest remains dry and flammable, putting out a forest fire does little to alter the remaining landscape, leaving it vulnerable to the slightest spark.

Can we really afford to continually be in the precarious position of continually waiting for each new spark and explosion? Certainly, this strategy does not appear to be working. The problem is fixable.

The bottom line is that we need to train our children, adolescents, and young adults to be much hardier in the face of discomfort. Regrettably, they are not receiving training in this area. Given the greater availability of funding and psychological resources than ever before, you would think that the tide would have favorably shifted. Yet this isn’t the case, the situation is deteriorating. Instruction in positive thinking, taking deep breaths, and relaxation training are not enough, nor should school teachers be held responsible or be expected to fix it.

By far the best solution to counter the expanding dominance of our survival instinct is to intervene when discomfort is at its most incipient stages. Our primitive instincts were never designed for the world we currently live in, so it’s no surprise that they can lead us to overreact, misrepresent reality, and even lead us to self-destruction. Since discomfort is inevitable, and life is not likely to become less demanding and pressure-packed, we have no alternative but to train ourselves to be tougher in the face of discomfort. I refer to this type conditioning as Discomfort Training, Discomfort Training is a course I offer to UCLA medical students and the UCLA athletic teams to boost their performance in situations where there is pressure, competition, or unsavory conditions.

More about Discomfort Training can be found in an article that was published in the journal of the United States Olympic Committee, Fall 2015, page 25-31. This article can be found here: http://go.teamusa.org/1Rr0Xg2

In subsequent articles, I will more elaborately discuss what can be specifically done to build hardiness, as well as, Discomfort Training, and the management and treatment of an overactive survival instinct."

“Trump bragged about doing exactly what the women describe. ‘I’ll go backstage before a show, and everyone’s getting dressed and ready and everything else,’ he said.”

Basically in a nutshell, this is a man saying that he has the right to gawk at naked teens since he “owns” that right.

We have laws against internet porn when it involves children. We actually send people to prison, for looking at photos of naked children, (and that includes teens since they are not 18 years old.) For looking at naked pictures of children and teens ON THEIR COMPUTER.

What is absolutely incredulous to me, is that we are not collectively, as a nation, standing up to not just the allegations of Donald Trump groping women; which is in and of itself appalling, but that he has in fact, bragged that he gawks, live, and in person, NAKED TEENS.

How is this not child pornography? How is this not grounds for each and every man and woman in the country, finally, finally, finally, realizing that this is a pathological narcissist who only sees things from his perspective; who blames everyone else for exactly what his behavior and feelings and motivations are, (actually called projective identification, a primitive defense mechanism used by people with a Borderline Personality Disorder, and as well with pathological Narcissistic Personality Disorder.).

But that’s all clinical speak and who cares about that?

When is each and every man and woman in the Republican party, including the “alt-right” going to care about children and stop excusing this man who excuses all of his behavior, including his right to indulge in live child pornography?! I want every single one of you undecided and/or Trump supporters to picture this: Your 15-year-old daughter is so excited and you are so proud; she is a contestant in a beauty pageant. Mr. Trump walks right in to gawk at her naked body, because he “owns” it. Picture it. Your kid. Your baby.

This is what you are condoning if you don’t stop this vile child pornographer. Yes, I am calling him what he is."

Our politics, if it is nothing else, is divided. Ironically, everybody is in agreement about the bitter polarity of our current government. Republicans all agree they can’t stand Democratic policies and Democrats all agree they can’t stand Republican policies.

Mitch McConnell so subscribes to this that he openly refuses to govern - which is his job - and finds himself constitutionally (and yet unconstitutionally) unwilling to conduct hearings and fill the SCOTUS vacancy. According to the founding document, isn’t the Judicial Branch important? According to Mitch, doing what the Constitution says is not as important as stopping his own government from moving forward.

What is the result of all of this palpable political enmity other than that sludge leaders like McConnell keep their job in perpetuity by crippling government and then pointing out how government isn’t working? Mud is slung, spin is offered, but most importantly the other side is the enemy. We never help our political enemy - even if that obstructs the execution of justice and flies in the face of our whole history.

He has reasons to feel like Donald Trump is his enemy, given the insults to his family in the wake of the primaries - having it suggested that one’s father may have been involved in the killing of President Kennedy is quite a slight - but Cruz bowed and endorsed Trump anyway. Hillary Clinton is the bitter political enemy of Ted Cruz, and in his mind our Christian virtue remains intact if we vote for a “serial philanderer” and “pathological liar”, not to mention somebody who is shaping up to be a legitimate antichrist.

How do we ever get at the truth when dealing with people like Cruz, Trump, and yes, Hillary Clinton? If spin is all, if we live in a propaganda-driven world seeking profit, how can we ever know the truth?

I don’t have all the answers. But I damn well know political enemies never help one another unless brute reality is forcing them to transcend politics. Chris Christie shouldn’t have hugged Barack Obama, politically speaking, because he is the enemy, but the suffering of the people of New Jersey in the wake of the storm transcended political considerations. Sometimes the truth just happens.

I have to ask myself: Why would a person who is a Republican - so, beyond any question of doubt, this individual despises the policies of Hillary Clinton - why would such a person say something which helps her to become president? More specifically, why would thoughtful, intelligent people, people who rose to the highest ranks of our military, why would they help her if they are Republicans?

That leads me to a big question I now ask everybody: Why would Republican generals and security personnel, people who understand the specifics of the danger in our world, why would they lie and say that Trump is a national security threat? Why would they say that and help Hillary?

Sometimes the truth just happens. Trump must indeed be dangerous and unstable and a threat to our safety. Because why would Republicans ever lie to help Democrats to become presidents? I know - I am 100% certain - that the Republicans who declared Trump a danger to our security were not telling a falsehood.

My good friends, I suggest that any time we see truth happen in politics we should pay close attention.

My son has autism, and he has been bullied at school. Mostly the good kids show up and help him, so it isn’t a sad story. He has been laughed at by kids who are healthy. And who is it there mocking my son? It is a bully - somebody a lot like Donald Trump.

I am against bullies. Aren’t you? Can we not agree that bullies are bottom feeders who prey upon people weaker than themselves to gain advantage or to feel good about themselves? Can we not agree that such people fundamentally suck?

My middle school in Florida back in the 70’s was a melting pot, full of evolutionary moment and ruthlessness and bullies. I remember there were people who would beat you up if you didn’t move out of their way. I wonder and I ask Trump supporters: Why would we want to make the bully at our school in charge of security there? Like, since I’m not the bully and I am in the way, isn’t that like voting to have myself get beaten up?

Absolutely.

We can trust the Republican generals when they say we can’t trust Trump, because they can’t stand Hillary Clinton. This transcends politics - it is the truth. We need only open our eyes to see it.

Ironically, though she is riddled with flaws and imperfections, we can trust Hillary Clinton with regard to how she will govern because she has held office. She has been the target of a sophisticated congressional colonoscopy for years, we know she has made mistakes, we know she has been a politician in her use of the truth - we have all the dirt under her fingernails. She is human, a luxury we must grant our governors if we are to govern ourselves.

What do we know about Donald J. Trump? He is a businessman, in real estate mostly. We have zero information about how he would govern or what he would do as president, only the words of a serial liar on the campaign trail.

If he is a business man, if that is his entire history, and he won’t release his taxes ... then what do we know about him? Nothing. Only what he says. Which, terrifyingly, brings us back to nothing.

In spite of anything he says, might a man like Donald Trump decide to grant the SCOTUS nominations to the people who will judge according to what is best and most profitable for Donald Trump? Given his history, why would we expect otherwise? Trump’s entire life has been devoted to one thing and one thing only - Trump. And money. I know that sounds like two things, but in his case it is one thing.

Why would we trust a bully who is withholding the most important and telling facts available about him? I know Hillary is not perfect, but we know nothing about Trump other than that he uses his power to grab the pussies of beautiful women he encounters at work and brags about it, he admires Putin, and he will bully everybody who gets in his way.

Why would we give an unstable, careless, dangerous man access to the most formidable military force ever known to mankind? Why would we give a perverted bully we know almost nothing about a fiddle and stockpile of fissionable matches?

I have a feeling we should listen to the Republican generals."
100598,1004,Trump Camp Offers Colorful Brit As Witness To Dispute Groping Claim,http://talkingpointsmemo.com/livewire/trump-campaign-provides-anthony-gilberthorpe,22,"After claiming to have proof that multiple accusations of sexual misconduct against their candidate were fabricated, the Trump campaign on Friday provided the New York Post with a colorful British witness to dispute one woman's allegation that Trump groped her on a plane in the early ‘80s.

The New York Post reported that Anthony Gilberthorpe “has no evidence to back up his claim—just his self-described excellent memory.”

Yet the Trump campaign told the Post that Gilberthorpe's experience in the first class cabin of an airliner in 1980 or 1981—Gilberthorpe couldn’t remember which—serves as proof that Trump did not grope Leeds. Gilberthorpe, 54, would have been 17 or 18 years old at the time.

“I have only met this accuser once and frankly cannot imagine why she is seeking to make out that Trump made sexual advances on her. Not only did he not do so (and I was present at all times) but it was she that was the one being flirtatious,” Gilberthorpe said in a note provided to The Post by the Trump campaign.

Gilberthorpe further claimed Leeds was “trying too hard” to win Trump’s attention.

“She wanted to marry him,” he said, according to the Post.

The Post noted that Gilberthorpe, a former Tory Party activist, made news as a whistleblower in 2014. He claimed that, as a 17-year-old, he “procured” boys, some of whom he said may have been underage, for sex parties with high-ranking British politicians. When Gilberthorpe came forward in 2014, most of the officials he accused of soliciting boys were already dead, and a former minister dismissed his claims, saying that Gilberthorpe had invented the story after his own political career failed to take off, according to the Daily Mail.

Gilberthorpe was also the alleged tipster behind a sex scandal that led to the downfall of conservative British parliamentarian Piers Merchant’s career. Merchant, after he resigned, accused Gilberthorpe of setting up his affair with a 17-year-old hostess and leaking news of it to the Sunday Mirror, a British tabloid, in exchange for £25,000.

Leeds, 74, claimed in a New York Times story published Wednesday night that Trump groped her without her on on a flight in the early ‘80s. In an interview with Anderson Cooper the following day, she further claimed Trump kissed her without consent and said the flight could have been in 1979.

Leeds described to the Times and Anderson Cooper that she was wearing a skirt, and that Trump attempted to reach up her skirt before she left the seat next to his and went to the back of the plane for the rest of the flight. Gilberthorpe, however, claimed to the Post that Leeds was wearing a white pantsuit."
100599,1004,Obama Questions Trump’s Grasp Of Democracy: You Can’t Jail Opponents,http://talkingpointsmemo.com/livewire/president-obama-trump-democracy-jailing-clinton,22,"Stumping for Hillary Clinton in Cleveland on Thursday, President Barack Obama reminded her Republican opponent that politicians cannot threaten to jail public figures in a democracy.

“We have fought against those kinds of things,” the president said, digging at Donald Trump’s grasp of the U.S. Constitution. “We say in a democracy you can't threaten to jail your opponents. There are things called due process. In a democracy, you can't just ban reporters or press that you don't like because there's this thing called the First Amendment. In a democracy, you have a contest but if you lose, then you say congratulations and you move on because the country and our system of government is bigger than any single individual.”

Trump has attacked the FBI for declining to prosecute Hillary Clinton for her use of a private email server as secretary of state, claiming that any other person would be in jail. “Lock her up!” has been a rallying cry at Trump rallies for months, and the Republican nominee promised to do just that at the second presidential debate on Sunday. Trump pledged to sic the Justice Department on Clinton and told her that if he won the election, she’d “be in jail.”

The real estate mogul has also banned reporters whose coverage he deemed unfair from campaign rallies and warned supporters that the election results will be “rigged” in Clinton’s favor unless they monitor polling stations.

Current and former government officials from both sides of the aisles have condemned his remarks as irresponsible and dangerous.

Obama criticized Republican leadership for allowing Trump to get away with comments like this for so long.

“I'm disturbed about Republican elected officials who know better but are still supporting this guy,” the president told the audience in Cleveland."
100600,1004,Sean Hannity Devotes An Entire Show To Bill Clinton Accusers,http://talkingpointsmemo.com/livewire/sean-hannity-bill-clinton-accusers,22,"Fox News host and outspoken Donald Trump supporter Sean Hannity devoted the entire hour of his program Thursday night to the stories of three women who have accused former President Bill Clinton of sexual misconduct.

The “Hannity” host said his show offered a platform for Juanita Broaddrick, Kathleen Willey and Paula Jones in order to tell a “whole generation of people that do not know your stories.” Kathy Shelton, who was raped at age 12 and whose rapist was appointed Hillary Clinton as his public defender, was also featured in the pre-taped special.

All four women appeared at a surprise press conference organized by the Trump campaign just 90 minutes before Sunday’s presidential debate, and later attended the debate as the Republican nominee’s guests.

During the special, Hannity mostly allowed the women to recount their own personal stories, throwing in a few rather leading questions of his own.

At the top of the hour, he asked the group if the mainstream media ever contacted them about their experiences.

“With 26 days to go and they haven't contacted you, does that reek of politics to you?” Hannity asked.

Reporters from BuzzFeed, Time, The Daily Beast, The Washington Post and others pointed out on social media that they have tried without success to contact or get on-the-record interviews with Clinton’s accusers. BuzzFeed also published a lengthy profile of Juanita Broaddrick in August.

Later in the interview, Hannity noted that all of the women have said they feared Hillary Clinton becoming president.

“You fear for your life?” he asked.

The interview aired after a day of hiccups for Fox News. Trump canceled a scheduled Thursday appearance on “Hannity” amid a wave of fresh allegations from women who said he groped or kissed them without their consent.

Bloomberg published a story on Wednesday, just as the allegations against Trump were breaking, referring to the hour-long Hannity special as the kick-off to the Trump campaign’s media blitz about Bill Clinton's sexual history. According to Bloomberg's Joshua Green, a Fox spokeswoman asked for a correction to his story, saying the Hannity episode would just be a “normal show” and that the Clinton accusers would be on for “two segments at most.""

After updating the story, Green learned that Hannity would in fact be dedicating the entire episode to Clinton’s accusers, prompting the spokeswoman to say she did not “know the communications between Hannity and the Trump campaign.” 
A Fox News spokeswoman told TPM that Green did not initially reach out to the channel for comment on how the episode would be framed.

After the interviews with the accusers aired on Thursday night’s show, Hannity and a panel discussed the women’s allegations for the remainder of the program.

Hannity has repeatedly said on-air that he plans to vote for Trump, even appearing in a campaign ad for the Republican nominee without giving Fox News a heads up. The Fox host has maintained that he can show such blatant favoritism toward one candidate because he is “not a journalist.”"
100601,1005,A Sinking Trump Could Take the Republican Congress Down With Him,http://www.motherjones.com/politics/2016/10/sinking-donald-trump-could-take-gop-congress-down-him,22,"For a case study in how much an election can change in a matter of days, you could do a lot worse than the past week. A week ago, it looked probable that Hillary Clinton would win the White House, possible that Democrats would take control of the Senate, and extremely unlikely that they would flip the House of Representatives. But a lot has changed in a few tumultuous days, and Donald Trump's disastrous week has put every chamber in play.

To recap: Last Friday, the Washington Post unearthed a 2005 video that showed Trump bragging about sexually assaulting women, prompting dozens of Republicans to rescind their endorsements of the Republican nominee. During a debate on Sunday, Trump responded to the video by haranguing his opponent with accusations of rape against Bill Clinton. House Speaker Paul Ryan announced on Monday he would no longer defend Trump and would focus his energy on maintaining the Republican congressional majority; Trump then more or less declared war on Ryan and the GOP establishment. By Thursday, press coverage of the election was dominated by the stories of women who have begun to come forward to claim that Trump assaulted them.

Over the course of those events, polls showed Clinton expanding her lead over Trump. Suddenly, the biggest questions about November 8 were no longer about the White House, but about just how long Clinton's coattails might be if she continues to build on her lead. Has enough gone wrong for Republicans to cost them the Senate, or even the House, where they hold a substantial built-in advantage?

Unlike presidential polls, the numbers for down-ballot races are trickier to interpret and often lag behind those for the top of the ticket. Though the polls for congressional races are not yet showing a clear effect, Democratic pollster Mark Mellman says they are likely to move in Democrats' favor. ""Races that people were looking at as outside possibilities become more reasonable in a scenario where Clinton has a bigger national lead,"" he says. Polling over the next week will provide a few clues as to whether Democrats' down-ballot fortunes will indeed rise as Trump sinks.

For the House, the most important polling number to watch is the congressional ""generic ballot"" question, which asks voters which party's candidate they are more likely to vote for in their district. In a truly representative House, any advantage in the generic ballot for a political party would mean a majority in the chamber. But the House isn't quite representative, and Democrats face three hurdles to gaining a majority.

First, some districts, such as those in low-population states like Wyoming, have fewer constituents, who therefore hold more voting power. Second, Democrats' diverse coalition is geographically concentrated in urban areas, limiting the number of congressional districts where they hold an edge and providing a systemic advantage to Republicans. Finally, there's gerrymandering. As the party in charge in a majority of states during the last redistricting process, Republicans drew maps in many states that defy geographical logic but are very friendly to their electoral prospects.  Pennsylvania, for example, has voted for a Democrat for president in every election since 1992, but 13 of its 18 districts are represented by Republicans in the House. That is not expected to change in November, even as the state is likely to go for Clinton.

As a result, Democrats will need to lead by more than a few percentage points on the generic ballot to gain control of the House. How much more? Pollsters and forecasters differ in their projections, but answers generally fall in the range of 6 to 10 percentage points.

Kyle Kondik, managing editor of the electoral forecasting site Sabato's Crystal Ball at the University of Virginia's Center for Politics, says the Democrats will need a 10-point margin to put the House in play. Mellman would see margins of between 6 and 8 points as an indication that a Democratic takeover of the House is possible. Republican pollster Bill McInturff says a 7-point advantage would mean Democrats ""have a shot.""

So where are the Democrats now? For months, polls have shown Democrats with a slight edge on the generic ballot but nowhere near enough to take back the House. On October 6, the day before the Trump video was released, Democrats had a 3.3-point lead in the RealClearPolitics average. But polls after the video have shown Democrats pulling ahead. A Wall Street Journal/NBC poll over the weekend gave Democrats a 6-point lead on the generic ballot, and a Reuters/Ipsos poll gave Democrats a 10-point lead. Democrats' advantage in the RealClearPolitics average has now jumped to 6.2. The next week could determine whether Democrats' polling gains are a blip or the beginning of a down-ballot wave.

""If you're basically just casting a protest vote for president, it's easy to imagine voters just not showing up at all,"" says Kondik. ""That's when it starts to get very dire for Republicans in the House and Senate.""
A second variable for down-ballot candidates is turnout. The big question is whether some Republican voters who cannot bring themselves to vote for Trump will simply stay home on Election Day, hurting the chances of Republican House and Senate candidates who need them to turn out. ""If you're basically just casting a protest vote for president, it's easy to imagine voters just not showing up at all,"" says Kondik. ""That's when it starts to get very dire for Republicans in the House and Senate.""

Turnout is hard to predict on the basis of polls. Poll questions that ask about levels of enthusiasm could be one indicator: Turnout among Republicans is likely to decline if they start indicating they're much less enthusiastic about Trump than they were about Mitt Romney in 2012. Another metric is early voting and absentee ballot returns, which are possible to track in certain states to determine whether Republicans are casting ballots in reduced numbers. In the swing state of North Carolina, for example, early data shows that Republicans are returning absentee ballots at a lower rate than they did in 2012—a bad sign for Trump as well as for the incumbent Republican senator, Richard Burr.

It's still not clear what effect the events of the last week will have on Senate races. The conventional wisdom holds that it will be hard for most Republican Senate candidates to outperform Trump by significant margins, so the presidential polling could dictate the outcome of competitive Senate races. Republican Senate candidates in states where Trump is tanking will have to rely on ticket splitting, when people vote for different parties for president and other offices. Split-ticket voting has declined in recent elections as voters' association with a political party has grown stronger. ""We live in a country where the partisan polarization is very high and very intense,"" says Mellman. ""Running three, four, five points ahead of the top of the ticket is difficult.""

Still, some Republican Senate candidates seem to be immune to Trump's collapse. Rob Portman, the incumbent Republican senator in Ohio, has polled ahead of Trump for months and likely will keep his seat even if Trump loses Ohio. (A poll released Thursday had him leading his opponent, former Gov. Ted Strickland, by 18 points.) In other races, Republicans may be dragged down because they decided late in the cycle to disavow Trump—a move that could hurt them among Trump's most ardent supporters. The prime examples are incumbent Sen. Kelly Ayotte in New Hampshire and Senate aspirant Joe Heck in Nevada. Mellman predicts those two will ""have problems""—that they could become casualties of the dilemma of being forced to choose between distancing themselves from Trump and risking the support of moderate voters by standing with him.

At the moment, however, it's not clear that Clinton is lifting Democratic Senate candidates along with her. In fact, recent polls show Democrats struggling even in races where they were thought to hold a substantial advantage before Trump's recent controversies, such as in Wisconsin, where Democrat Russ Feingold suddenly leads incumbent GOP Sen. Ron Johnson by only a few percentage points in the latest polls. FiveThirtyEight actually found an inverse correlation on Thursday between Clinton's polling and that of Democratic Senate candidates in the past few weeks. But it's too early to tell whether this is a sign of more ticket splitting this cycle than pollsters thought was possible, or whether Clinton's rise is simply slow to manifest at the Senate level.

The question, says Kondik, is whether we are looking at a cycle like 1996, when Bill Clinton easily won reelection but Republicans kept the House and the makeup of Congress hardly budged. ""I just wonder if we're actually in that kind of election cycle,"" he says. There's a ""clear trend toward less ticket splitting."""
100602,1005,Elizabeth Warren Asks Obama to Remove His Top Financial Regulator,http://www.motherjones.com/politics/2016/10/elizabeth-warren-mary-jo-white-sec-barack-obama,22,"Sen. Elizabeth Warren demanded Friday that President Barack Obama demote his top financial regulator, Securities and Exchange Commission Chairwoman Mary Jo White, who's held the position since 2013. The Massachusetts Democrat raised numerous objections in a letter to White's tenure atop the SEC, narrowing in on White's resistance to writing regulations that would compel corporations to reveal their political spending habits. By refusing to rein in how corporations can spend money, Warren argued, White has allowed dark money to explode under her watch.

""I do not make this request lightly,"" Warren's letter concluded. ""I have tried both publicly and privately to persuade Chair White to direct the agency's resources toward pressing matters of compelling interest to investors and the public, and toward completing those rules that Congress has required it to implement. But after years of fruitless efforts, it is clear that Chair White is set on her course. The only way to return the SEC to its intended purpose is to change its leadership.""

Obama cannot fire White outright from the SEC. But the president does have the authority to replace her as chair with one of the agency's other commissioners. White would still be a commissioner and be able to vote on final rulemakings, but she wouldn't have the same authority to direct the SEC's spending priorities in deciding which rules to formulate.

""I do not make this request lightly...But after years of fruitless efforts, it is clear that Chair White is set on her course,"" Warren wrote.
Warren recognizes that it would be ""an uncommon act"" for Obama to remove White as chair, but she thinks it is imperative that Obama act, given ""White's extraordinary, ongoing efforts to undermine the agency's central mission.""

White was confirmed as head of the SEC in 2013 by unanimous consent, but the liberal wing of the Democratic Party has never been enamored with her. A former US attorney, White had worked as a defense attorney representing financial institutions prior to joining the government. When her nomination came before the Senate, she reassured Democrats that her stint defending banks wouldn't influence her work as a regulator. But since taking the reins at the SEC, White has refused to have the agency work on a rule that progressives have pined for since the Supreme Court's 2010 Citizens United decision made it possible for corporations to spend unfettered sums on politics.

Before Mary Schapiro, White's predecessor, left office, she said the agency would soon be proposing a disclosure rule that would force public companies to reveal all the money they devote to political activities. But as soon as White took control of the SEC, that effort to shine light on dark money came to a halt. White removed disclosure from the list of rules on the agency's agenda, and it hasn't come back since.

""For years, the Chair of the SEC, Mary Jo White, has refused to develop a political spending disclosure rule despite her clear authority to do so, and despite unprecedented and overwhelming investor and public support for such a rule,"" Warren wrote in her letter to Obama. ""This brazen conduct is merely the most recent and prominent example of Chair White undermining your Administration's priorities and ignoring the SEC's core mission of investor protection."" Instead of furthering disclosure of corporate activities, White has actively worked under the ""curious presumption that public companies currently disclose too much information,"" Warren said.

As soon as White took control of the SEC, the effort to shine light on dark money came to a halt.
In addition to her objections over the dark money disclosure rule, Warren singled out the SEC's failure to put into effect rules required under the 2010 Dodd-Frank law intended to clean up Wall Street following the recession. The SEC has yet to finalize 19 mandatory rules from the law. White ""appears to view these congressional mandates as mere suggestions that the agency is free to ignore,"" Warren says. ""And she has gone further—publicly denigrating some of these requirements as superfluous and misguided.""

Warren has long objected to White's administration of the SEC. She's penned numerous letters requesting action from White, and at a June congressional hearing, she told White, ""A year ago I called your leadership at the SEC extremely disappointing. Today I am more disappointed than ever."" Apparently the sentiment was shared; White replied, ""I'm disappointed in your disappointment.""

Warren opened her letter by noting that the recent government funding bill passed by Congress included a Republican-backed measure restricting the SEC from putting out a final disclosure rule and warned that, with White's disinterest in the rule, the same measure is likely to be there when Congress must next pass a spending bill in December. Beyond that, there isn't much to explain the timing of the letter. Maybe it was part of an effort to signal to the next administration that Warren won't sit back on presidential nominees that she finds troublesome. As recent emails from WikiLeaks indicated, when Warren's staff first met with Hillary Clinton's staff last year, the main concern from the Warren wing was whom Clinton might appoint as financial regulators."
100603,1005,The Stunningly Long List of Women Who've Accused Trump of Sexual Assault,http://www.motherjones.com/politics/2016/10/all-women-whove-accused-trump-sexual-assault,22,"Last Friday, the Washington Post published a leaked tape showing Donald Trump speaking to Billy Bush of Access Hollywood, describing groping and kissing women without their consent. Following the tape's release, the Trump campaign saw falling poll numbers and a mass exodus of support from horrified Republicans. Trump responded to the onslaught of criticism by saying that what he described was just ""locker room talk""—not a description of something he'd ever actually done.

But on Wednesday night, the New York Times published the accounts of two women who alleged that Trump had done precisely what he'd so lewdly described on tape—groped and kissed them without consent. Since then, 17 women have gone public with more tales of unwanted sexual touching or inappropriate behavior by Trump. During a speech on Thursday, Trump denied all of their accounts. Here's a list of all the allegations against Trump so far:

""He probably doesn't want me telling the story about that time he continually grabbed my ass and invited me to his hotel room,"" one woman wrote.
In July, months before the Access Hollywood tape came to light, Jill Harth, a makeup artist, spoke to the Guardian about her sexual assault allegations against Trump, which she filed in a 1997 lawsuit accusing Trump of ""attempted rape."" She recounted how in 1992 and 1993, Trump made unwanted verbal sexual advances and groped her several times, including in one 1993 episode at his Mar-a-Lago estate. Harth had come there with her boyfriend at the time to finalize and celebrate a beauty-pageant-related business deal. Harth alleged that Trump, while giving a tour of the estate, pulled her into the bedroom of one of his children, pushed her against a wall, and was ""all over"" her, trying to get his hands up her dress. ""I had to physically say: 'What are you doing? Stop it,'"" Harth recalled.
In May, the New York Times published the story of Temple Taggart, who alleged that in 1997, when she was the 21-year-old Miss Utah, Trump introduced himself to her by kissing her on the lips: ""I thought, 'Oh my God, gross.' He was married to Marla Maples at the time. I think there were a few other girls that he kissed on the mouth,"" Taggart said.
In June, Cassandra Searles, Miss Washington USA 2013, alleged that Trump repeatedly grabbed her butt: ""He probably doesn't want me telling the story about that time he continually grabbed my ass and invited me to his hotel room,"" she wrote.
In Wednesday's New York Times story, Jessica Leeds recalled being seated in first class next to Donald Trump on a flight in the early 1980s. She remembered that about 45 minutes after takeoff, Trump allegedly pushed up the armrest between their two seats and began grabbing her breasts and trying to stick his hands up her skirt. ""He was like an octopus,"" Leeds told the Times. ""His hands were everywhere.”
The other woman who told her story to the New York Times was Rachel Crooks, who in 2005 was a receptionist at a real estate company based in Trump Tower. Then 22 years old, she ran into Donald Trump outside one of the building's elevators. Crooks alleged that when she introduced herself to Trump and shook hands, he would not let go of her hand and instead began kissing her on the cheeks and finally on the mouth.
Mindy McGillivray spoke to the the Palm Beach Post on Wednesday about her alleged encounter with Donald Trump in 2003, while she was assisting with a photo shoot for a Ray Charles concert at the Mar-a-Lago resort. She told the Post that after the show had ended, she was standing near Donald and Melania Trump when all of a sudden she felt someone grab her butt. When she turned around, she recalled, she saw Donald Trump, who quickly turned away.
""Who do you complain to?"" another woman said. ""He owns the pageant.""
Also on Wednesday night, People published a personal essay by journalist Natasha Stoynoff alleging that in December 2005, Trump had pushed her against a wall and began kissing her while she was on a reporting assignment at Mar-a-Lago. ""I was stunned,"" she wrote. ""And I was grateful when Trump's longtime butler burst into the room a minute later, as I tried to unpin myself.""
Another woman, Jennifer Murphy, came forward on Wednesday night with allegations that Donald Trump kissed her on the lips during a job interview. Murphy, who told her story to Grazia, was a contestant on season 4 of ""The Apprentice,"" and plans to vote for Donald Trump.
Five contestants who competed in the 1997 Miss Teen USA pageant, which Donald Trump owned at the time, told BuzzFeed that Trump walked through their dressing rooms while the girls, between the ages of 15 and 19, were changing, causing two of them to rush to cover themselves up. Eleven other contestants contacted by BuzzFeed did not remember Trump entering the changing room.
Two Miss USA contestants made similar allegations to the Guardian and CBS about Trump walking into their changing room during the 2001 pageant. Tasha Dixon, the former Miss Arizona, told CBS that Trump walked into the changing room while some girls were fully naked. ""Who do you complain to?"" Dixon said. ""He owns the pageant."" The other contestant spoke to the Guardian anonymously, and recalled a similar moment from the 2001 pageant: ""He walked in, he stood, and he stared. He was doing it because he knew that he could.""
On Friday, the Washington Post published the story of former model Kristin Anderson, who alleged that in the early '90s, Donald Trump—who Anderson said had not introduced himself—slid his hand up her skirt and touched her vagina through her underwear at a Manhattan nightclub.
Also on Friday, Summer Zervos, a former candidate on The Apprentice, spoke at a press conference with attorney Gloria Allred. There she alleged that in 2007, across several meetings about potential job opportunities, Donald Trump kissed Zervos and later groped her. Zervos alleged that at one meeting, Trump had her brought to his bungalow at a Beverly Hills hotel, where he immediately began kissing her, put a hand on her breast and ""thrust his genitals"" at her while she pushed him away several times and made clear that she didn't want to take part in such activity.
The question remains as to why the allegations made by women before the Access Hollywood tape's release—like those of Jill Harth or Temple Taggart—didn't receive far broader attention when they surfaced months ago. This week, the Guardian reporter who first recounted Harth's story in July told the Columbia Journalism Review that the lack of initial attention may stem from a common pattern in sexual assault allegations: Few people pay attention to women's stories until a man's voice affirms them. ""Trump came out in leaked video and said, in so many words, that sexual assault is something that he does regularly,"" she said. ""It wasn't any woman saying it; it was a powerful man running for president saying it that got people to take it seriously, which is remarkable."""
100604,1006,"Hillary: Trump literally stalked me at the debate, you know",http://hotair.com/archives/2016/10/14/hillary-trump-literally-stalked-debate-know/,22,"Do these people really not have enough “war on women” material on Trump circulating right now that Hillary has to use a loaded, obviously scripted term like this? Good lord. If you want to knock Trump for trailing her around the stage, you’re better off noting that Democrats themselves have first-hand experience with invading an opponent’s space at a townhall debate to try to break his or her concentration. It was a dumb tactic that didn’t work then, and it didn’t work now. Perhaps future nominees will learn something from it.

It goes to show how comfortable Clinton is with Trump’s attacks on Bill’s sexual misconduct, though, that she’d taunt Trump here by suggesting he’s a creeper. With good reason: Here’s an interesting gender split from a new YouGov poll that asked people if they thought it was appropriate for Trump to bring up Bill Clinton’s behavior at the debate to attack Hillary. Those numbers are partly being driven by partisan leanings, I’m sure. Men tilt Republican while women tilt Democratic, so go figure they’d view an attack by the Republican nominee differently. The phrasing of the question might be helping Clinton too. The point of Trump’s attack wasn’t to use Bill Clinton’s behavior against Hillary, it was to say that Hillary’s own behavior in seeking to discredit his accusers was gross. But then, that was always the risk in a clumsy messenger like Trump trying to make that point — if voters, especially women voters, saw his insistence on bringing up Bill as a way to shame Hillary, the wronged wife, instead of as an indictment of her for complicity in Bill’s malfeasance, it was destined to backfire. Interestingly, even 29 percent of Republicans saw the gambit as inappropriate while a near-majority of independents, 48 percent, agreed. (Forty-three percent of indies thought it was fine.)

One more poll result. This is the split when people are asked whether Trump would be a good role model for children: That’s not from YouGov, that’s from the new poll released last night by the far-left hacks at, er, Fox News. Clinton scored 54/43, so feel free to remind your kids tonight that it’s fine to commit a major felony involving national security as long as you’ve got the FBI in the tank for you. "
100605,1006,Mike Pence: Evidence is coming “before the day is out” that will show the allegations against Trump aren’t true,http://hotair.com/archives/2016/10/14/mike-pence-evidence-coming-day-will-show-groping-allegations-arent-true/,22,"The key bit comes at 5:00 of the clip below. He doesn’t say which allegations, specifically, will be disproved. The one in the NYT about Trump groping a woman on an airplane in the 1980s? The one in People magazine about him pinning a reporter to the wall and kissing her? The one about him walking in on contestants backstage at Miss Teen USA while they were changing? Hard to imagine what evidence he could produce to debunk the first of those, but he might have a friendly letter or email from the People reporter, Natasha Stoynoff, that’s dated after their alleged encounter at Mar-a-Lago. That fact, that women who claim sexual misconduct sometimes behave cordially towards the man they’re accusing after the misconduct supposedly happened, was used against some of the Fox News women who accused Roger Ailes. He might also have pageant contestants lined up who don’t remember him ever walking in on them in the dressing room (even though he, er, sort of admitted to Howard Stern that he does that). This election being what it is, though, the evidence is probably going to have something to do with the Times allegations and we’re going to end up in a national debate over whether armrests in the first-class cabin on commercial jets in the 1980s really were movable or not.

Maybe the “evidence” will be that the Mexicans are behind all of this.

Donald Trump will broaden his attack against the media to hit globalism and the Clinton Foundation by charging that Mexican billionaire Carlos Slim is part of a biased coalition working in collusion with the Clinton campaign and its supporters to generate news reports of decades-old allegations from several women…

As early as Friday, Mr. Trump is planning to claim that Mr. Slim, as a shareholder of New York Times Co. and donor to the Clinton Foundation, has an interest in helping Hillary Clinton’s campaign, according to a Trump adviser.

Attacking the Mexican billionaire would allow Mr. Trump to hit several targets. He could slam the “failing” New York Times, which he says had to be “rescued” by a “foreigner”—Mr. Slim, the adviser said.
That’d be right in line with yesterday’s New World Order rant, which lacked nothing except a foreigner in the villain role. Meanwhile, as I’m writing this, this is breaking: One thing I’ve been thinking as regards the Times story is that, if the charges really were made up whole cloth in order to smear Trump for political reasons, they’re tamer than I would expect them to be. If you’re trying to singlehandedly blow the guy’s candidacy apart and are willing to lie to any extent to do it, claiming that he groped you for a few seconds — in public, on an airplane, no less — wouldn’t be the logical way to do it. You’d claim a sustained assault, in private, involving actual rape. (Which is not to imply that Juanita Broaddrick’s claims against Bill Clinton, which do involve that scenario, aren’t credible. Watch any interview with her and you’ll see how believable she is.) In particular, if you’re prepared to lie, you’d want to neutralize Trump’s attacks against Clinton by accusing him of the very worst things that Bill is accused of. Instead the Times story involves an unwanted kiss and the plane incident. The only reason I can think of for a liar to prefer a story of “minor” sexual assault to one involving something even more heinous is if they’re calibrating their narrative to the “Access Hollywood” tape, wanting to show that Trump really is willing to be “casually” rough with women due to his sense of entitlement. But even then — if it’s a lie, why not lie big? The tape would simply be assimilated into a new narrative that Trump wasn’t telling Billy Bush the full story of what he’s actually capable of."
100606,1006,British man says Trump accuser is lying about their encounter in first class,http://hotair.com/archives/2016/10/14/british-man-claims-trump-accuser-lied-airplane-encounter/,22,"We were promised some proof that Trump didn’t do the things his accusers claim he did and here it is. The Trump campaign says it was contacted by Anthony Gilberthorpe after the NY Times published an accusation of inappropriate touching by Jessica Leeds.

Leeds says she was groped by Trump on a flight sometime in the early 1980s after being bumped up to first class. Trump has denied the accusation but, until now, hasn’t offered any proof for his side of the story. From the NY Post:

Gilberthorpe, 54, said he was sitting across the first class aisle from the couple and saw nothing inappropriate. Leeds was wearing a white pantsuit, he said, while Trump was wearing a suit and cuff-links, which he gave to his British flight companion.

Indeed, Gilberthorpe claimed, Leeds was “trying too hard” in her attempt to win Trump over.

“She wanted to marry him,” Gilberthorpe said of Leeds, who apparently made the confession when Trump excused himself and went to the bathroom.
Gilberthorpe seems confident Jessica Leeds is the woman he remembers seeing on a flight in 1980 or 1981 based on the old photo that appears in the NY Times video clip. One obvious question that doesn’t get raised in the NY Post story is how Gilberthorpe wound up in first class across from Trump when he was around 19 years old. However, there is a mention of what he was doing around this time. As the NY Post explains it, “Gilberthorpe made headlines in 2014, when he went public with a claim that as a 17-year-old he procured boys (some who “could have been” underage”) for sex parties with high-ranking British politicians.” Here’s a 2014 story about Gilberthorpe’s claims:

Mr Gilberthorpe claims that at the 1983 Blackpool conference he was asked by Dr Alistair Smith – the Tory Party Chairman in Scotland – to arrange for young rent boys to have sex with two high-profile cabinet ministers, who we are not naming today.

Other MPs at that party were said to include Rhodes Boyson and Keith Joseph.

In that week he presented the _then-Prime Minister Mrs Thatcher with a cake to mark her 58th birthday. But he says he also had a more sordid role – using his young looks to find these underage boys for her ministers.
That’s just one of the stories Gilberthorpe tells about Tory Members of Parliament and underage boys. So did this happen? Is Gilberthorpe a reliable witness? It’s hard to say. There has been an official government inquiry into the accusations which go well beyond the claims made by Gilberthorpe. Some news outlets such as the Mirror, the Daily Mail and Vice News have taken the story seriously and included Gilberthorpe as one of the witnesses to the events in question. The Vice story gives some background on the broader accusations about pedophiles in Parliament.

On the other hand, some sources have claimed Gilberthorpe is a money and publicity seeker who has made up tabloid stories in the past. From Private Eye:

In September 1987, for example, he announced his engagement in the Times to Miss Leah Bergdorf-Hunt, a fashion designer from California. The Gloucester Express reported the news on its front page under the headline “Gilby to Marry”. It quoted Gilberthorpe as saying: “Both our families are delighted… I hope this will explain to a few people about my recent visits to America.” But there was no engagement, and indeed no Miss Bergdorf-Hunt. As revealed in Eye 690, the whole thing was a fantasy.
There’s also another significant story involving a married Member of Parliament named Piers Merchant who began having an affair with a 17-year-old political volunteer in 1997. One day pictures of Merchant and the girl, whose name is Anna Cox, appeared in the Mirror. The pictures were screenshots from a video created by Merchant’s friend Anthony Gilberthorpe who had essentially set Merchant up. From Merchant’s own account of the story in the Guardian:

The story was splashed across the Sunday Mirror the next day. Anthony Gilberthorpe had set the whole thing up, ensuring that I was up in York in his flat with Anna, that the room was covered in CCTV and wired for sound. I’d known him for years, he’d been a friend of the family, but he was paid about £25,000.

I resigned, because I felt it was the only way to prevent such intrusion and I felt I could never do my job properly again. I felt huge relief. Then I decided to sell my story to the Mail. The Mirror was furious and stretched the story out on the front page for three successive Sundays, with stills from the video footage. Then they broadcast the footage of me in bed having sex with Anna on their cable TV channel, Live TV.
What to make of all this is hard to say. On the one hand, Gilberthorpe was willing to plan to humiliate his friend for a payday. That makes him seem like a mercenary. On the other hand, he has exposed sexual abusers twice before which makes it seem less likely he’d be willing to cover for someone acting, as Leeds claims, like an Octopus. Still, there’s enough uncertainly about Gilberthorpe’s credibility, and enough other accusers, that this doesn’t really settle the question. It will be interesting to see if the NY Times follows up on the exact date of the flight and the claim that Leeds was wearing a specific outfit. Both of those claims seem like something that could potentially be verified."

While rifling through the numerous cables, here’s something that stood out.

Discussing the subject of rape, Hillary believes every person is to be believed “at first until they are disbelieved based on evidence.”

Makes complete sense.

However, why has Hillary yet to believe Juanita Broaddrick?

Why has she silenced her?


From Zero Hedge:

One of the first email chains just released is a follow up to what we think is one of the key stories so far, namely the disappearance of the 16th Sid Blumenthal email, as per the thread “Proposed response to upcoming State Dept disclosure on Sid emails.” This is an issue discussed yesterday in our post “Where Is Sidney Blumenthal’s 16th “Missing” Email?” which we urge everyone to read. Another email chain between Clinton campaign staffers Josh Schwerin and Jennifer Epstein brings attention to a tweet by Bloomberg politics correspondent Jennifer Epstein who notes in December 2015 that Hillary Clinton was “asked if she believes people who claim rape like Juanita Broderick and Kathleen Willey…” to which she then tweets that “HRC on rape claims against WJC:l: “I would say that everybody should be believed at first until they are disbelieved based on evidence.”


HRC on rape claims against WJC:l: ""I would say that everybody should be believed at first until they are disbelieved based on evidence."" We’re assuming WJC stands for William (Bill) Jefferson Clinton.

But you see that Hillary is saying Juanita is to be believed, right?

Quick, alert the press!

What about all the other women who have claimed they were assaulted by husband Bill?

Why were they silenced and threatened?

Is a rape victim only to be believed if that person is accusing a Republican candidate for office?

Why the double standard?

So many questions, so little time.

Unfortunately, we will never get our answer because the media is an extension of the Democrat party."

She’s above us.

All Clinton wants is control.

Control of our lives; the constitution; everything.

Might sound a little hyperbolic, but the facts back up the claim.


Check out this cartoon from A.F. Branco…

From Comically Incorrect: Here’s precisely how grandma feels about ‘everyday Americans,’ courtesy of WikiLeaks…


From Daily Caller:

Newly leaked emails reveal that Hillary Clinton hates the phrase “everyday Americans.”

The emails, hacked from the campaign chairman John Podesta’s Gmail account and published by Wikileaks Tuesday, reveal an exchange between him and Jen Palmieri — the Clinton campaign’s director of communications — where the two struggled to decide how the phrase should be used in a speech Clinton gave in New Hampshire in April 2015.

…

“I know she has begun to hate everyday Americans, but I think we should use it once the first time she says I’m running for president because you and everyday Americans need a champion,” Podesta replied.

A smart person wouldn’t trust Hillary to run a New York hot dog stand.

What does that say about progressives as a whole?

If liberals think Hillary cares about them or their interests, they’re in for a rude awakening if she beats Donald Trump in November.

FLOTUS can’t believe the billionaire uses such vulgar language, and condemns the 2005 video of him talking about women with Billy Bush.

Yet, this is a woman who says Beyonce is a role model for her two girls.

Has Michelle ever seen a Beyonce music video?

Did she catch Queen Bey’s Super Bowl halftime performance when she trashed cops?

Does she not recall sitting through America-hating Rev. Wright’s sermons? Is there a double standard here, Michelle?

From Rush Limbaugh: RUSH: So Michelle Obama’s in New Hampshire, and she’s commenting on Trump’s locker room talk, and she says, “It’s not locker room talk. I don’t know men who talk that way. Decent men do not talk that way. What Trump was talking about was sexual assault,” she said. “Donald Trump was acting out sexual assault, and it is intolerable.” Something… You know, Trump said… If you go back to this audiotape, he said, “When you’re a celebrity, they let you do anything.” How can there be assault if somebody’s granting permission?

How can it be assault if they let you do anything? But that’s a fine point. The fine point is Trump… Men brag, and she is telling people that she doesn’t know men who brag. You know the people that have been to the White House? How about some of the rappers that talk about their bitches and their hos have performed such lyrics in the White House? But she doesn’t know men who talk and sing about sexual assault. It’s all over hip-hop lyrics and has been for a while! So is assault on the police a feature of some hip-hop lyrics, and it’s been performed at the White House. But she doesn’t know men who talk that way. She doesn’t know decent guys who talk that way.

No. She’s only invited them to the White House to perform and then bestowed great honors on them. And if you’re asking: No, she hasn’t had a comment on her husband parading around an airplane 2007 with an erection in front of a bunch of impressed female infobabes. She hasn’t commented on that.

And then she said… You know what else she said? She said, “We need to elect Hillary Clinton because we need somebody to heal the wounds that divide us.” Well, now, wait just a minute. Wounds that divide us? Why are there divisions in Barack Obama’s America? Why are there wounds in Barack Obama’s America? Why is there any healing necessary in Barack Obama’s America? Whatever happened to hope and change? Whatever happened to postracial? Whatever happened to postpartisan? Whatever happened to all this?

So you mean we have racial wounds?

We have wounds, we need healing, and apparently Obama’s not up to the job?

Video of Wright’s “God d*** America” speech… Maybe it’s a racial thing with Michelle.

When black entertainers curse and gyrate and demean women, it’s okay.

But when a billionaire white man talks about women improperly, it’s bad.

Interesting.

100610,1008,Make America Great Again is a Movement,http://www.americanthinker.com/articles/2016/10/make_america_great_again_is_a_movement.html,22,"On Rush's radio show, VP nominee Mike Pence said when he and Trump pull into a venue greeted by huge crowds and long lines, Trump has often said to him, “This is a movement, and it's about this country, and it's about the American people.”

I say, “Amen, and right on brother.” How else can you explain Trump defeating a respected black doctor and 15 politicians to win the GOP presidential nomination hands down? GOP voters simply were fed up with broken promises, betrayals, and endless, fruitless fundraising. I get it.

Since writing the “American Tea Party Anthem”, I have been on the front lines fighting for freedom since 2008; speaking and singing at over 500 tea party rallies; over 15 national bus tours. Evolving into chairman of the Conservative Campaign Committee, I traveled state-to-state helping conservatives win elections, resulting in gifting the GOP control of the House and Senate.

Over the past eight years, my wife Mary and I have spent so much time on the road leaving Sammy, our greyhound, with pet/house sitters that he does not even greet us anymore when we return home; only a disinterested glance from his doggy bed.

Like my fellow patriots, I did not know the GOP was playing us; afraid to oppose the black president on some issues while siding with Obama on others. For eight years the GOP claimed they were powerless to stop Obama from being the most lawless president in U.S. history; powerless to keep their campaign promises to push back against Obama's tyranny; powerless to stop Obama from using government to punish his opposition; powerless to stop Obama from destroying our economy; powerless to stop Obama from implementing policies which endanger American lives. 

And then, along came Trump, “I will make America great again!” The same way a dog-whistle can only be heard by dogs, Trump's promise perked up the ears of the American people. The America-hating Left and political establishment could not hear the renewed hope that Americans heard in Trump's proclamation.

Fat and happy with the “Washington cartel” status quo, politicians in both parties were outraged that a mere commoner who does not even know how to speak pro-politician would dare enter their domain.

As with millions of Americans, Trump's “Make America Great Again” movement has given me hope. Leftists who control the airways pound patriots 24/7 with their message that America has unfairly exploited, dominated and destroyed the planet for far too long. Their brainwashing is so effective that American black millionaires believe themselves to be victims of evil America.

In the Left's battle to enforce planetary justice, they are orchestrating America's cultural and economic decline. The Left uses everything from bogus new reports and polls to TV sitcoms to dispirit patriots from fighting to restore America. The Left tells us 24/7, “You are outnumbered.” “Throw down your weapons.” “Resistance is futile.” Behold your new god: Progressive Thinking Man.

In the late 1960s, I was a rare black student from the Baltimore projects at the prestigious Maryland Institute College of Art; there on scholarship. I worked various jobs to cover the cost of my books and art supplies. The majority of my fellow collegians were white from wealthy families; totally funded by their parents. And yet, all I heard from them was endless vitriol for their country and parents.

The curriculum at MICA contributed to instilling anti-America, anti-parents and anti-God mindsets. A freshman required course was titled, “The History of Ideas”. In hindsight, I realize the professor was a nut with serious issues. Still, he was a professor so I assumed he was much smarter than my parents. That course shattered everything taught to me by my Christian parents.

Chuckling, Dad recently reminded me what I said to him about God after taking that college course. “Dad, I still believe, but not the way you believe.”

During my college years hating God, country and parents was cool. I still remember a white hippie buddy's rant, “This f***ing country is so f***ed up. No f***ing way will I bring a f***ing baby into this f***ing country.” While I knew America had issues, I could not understand his passionate anger and deep hatred for our country.

Well, guess who has been infiltrating and taking over government, media and education for the past 40 years? Answer: America-hating hippies, filling generations with anti-Americanism and a perverted definition of fairness. The Left's erroneous message is the world outside of America has too little because Americans have and use too much. This explains Obama's desire to bring America down from her high horse.

Trump's popularity, which bridges all demographics, tells me that the Left's anti-America virus has not reached critical mass. Most Americans long to see a leader who will put our country's best interest first.

Hillary Clinton is evil incarnate; exposed to “hate everyday Americans.” It is so repulsive watching Hillary's TV ads and media operatives using standard Democrat tactics -- divide Americans into bogus victimized groups and portray the democrat candidate as the savior.

As I stated, the Left is obsessed with bringing America down from her place in the world and implementing planetary justice. Therefore, the Left hides Hillary's multiple insidious evil crimes and misdemeanors. Meanwhile, the Left blows up Trump's shortcomings which are the equivalent of jaywalking or spitting on the sidewalk compared to Hillary's.

The Left and political establishment still do not understand Trump's infectious appeal. They are incapable of hearing the higher sound of hope for a renewed America. Trump is leading a serendipitous movement for such a time as this. No amount of crap thrown at him has stuck. Donald Trump will be our next president of the United States.

My patriot ears heard Trump's message of renewed hope for America. I penned a parody song titled, “Trump Train”. 

Please enjoy the music video and spread far and wide. Encourage Americans of all stripes to hear Trump's message and join the movement to “Make America Great Again!”

100611,1008,Trumping the Feminists,http://www.americanthinker.com/articles/2016/10/trumping_the_feminists.html,22,"As of last Friday, feminists across the country are melting down over the shock of having to see and hear a twelve-year-old tape of Donald Trump talking about behaving badly toward women.  One can only assume that these mighty warriors for women have been living in a bubble for the last forty years.  They apparently thought their plan to transform men into full-fledged wimps had been fully implemented.

Trump obviously missed two generations of enforced indoctrination and sublimation that has indeed turned many men into pajama boys.  He, on the other hand, has behaved like a thug rapper who thinks the words he spews are a how-to manual.  Everyone is offended by his past exploits, his apparent belief that because he was rich, he could get away with brutish conduct.

Trump clearly has a history of inappropriate behavior, not unlike several past presidents and politicians, but not quite as vile.  He hasn't killed anyone, as Ted Kennedy did.

Now the NYT is hawking a video of more women who say he groped them, one of them thirty years ago!  If true, why did they not haul off and slug him?  Where was all that girl power?  Wasn't that the height of the feminist movement, when they were all taking self-defense classes?

These women who are so, so offended by tales of Trump from long ago are pathetic.  Have none of them ever been to Italy?  All over the world, men have been known to be, and often are, boors.  It has been known to be the nature of the beast.

Do those of us with daughters teach them to plug their ears and run as fast as they can from ugly words?  No.  They have to learn that not everyone is civilized or well-mannered, kind or respectful.  We teach them to have self-respect and, if bothered by another person, male or female, to fight back, with words, distance, or physical force if necessary.  We teach them not to take aggressive intrusion on their person from anyone.  To be human, one must be aware.

Much of such commonsense parenting is being undermined by the foolishness of trigger warnings and safe spaces on college campuses.  Young people are being taught that speech must be severely regulated lest someone's feelings be hurt.  All in all, feminism has been turned upside-down and inside out.  These women want to be considered equal to men – powerful, competent, advocates for other women.  At the same time, they act like fragile children, as afraid of gutter language as they are of an inappropriate touch.  But these same women do not speak out for the millions of women in the Muslim world who are oppressed and abused; that would be politically incorrect.  They do not speak out for the Yazidi women who have for several years now been sold into sex slavery in service of barbaric jihadists.  That too would be an affront to Obama's rule that we must speak no evil about radical Islamic terrorists.

In short, no modern woman should have her feathers ruffled by unseemly words uttered years ago.  Better we worry about the words Hillary Clinton utters today.  She promises to raise our taxes by trillions of dollars, which means more massive debt.  She promises to increase refugee immigration by 500%, which will guarantee an increase in domestic terrorism.  She wants more gun control, more divisive racial rhetoric, more restrictions on law enforcement, more federal control of our schools, and Supreme Court justices who will further abrogate the Constitution.  In short, the end of America as founded.

Everyone knows that Hillary Clinton has a forty-year history of pathological lying.  Everyone knows she, in the words of Colin Powell, has ""unbridled ambition.""  People know she abused the women who threatened her husband's political career.  She was the one who hired the detectives to dig up dirt on them.  Those detectives stalked and harassed some of them.  Hillary name-called, lied, and dismissed her husband's predatory behavior as Bill being Bill.  Those women were victims of her as much as they were victims of Bill Clinton.

Hillary has as gritty and perhaps an even grittier history than Trump of bad behavior toward women.  She has taken millions of dollars from Saudi Arabia, Qatar, etc. – Muslim countries where women cannot drive, must be covered head to toe in burkas, and can be stoned for a variety of small reasons.  Using Trump's past as a weapon to take attention away from her own crimes that are being exposed on a daily basis by Wikileaks is so calculated, so transparent.  But it's what the Clintons do.

The feminist movement has done terrible damage to several generations of women who embraced it.  The first wave, that began just after the advent of the birth control pill, taught girls that they ""could have it all"" – education, career, and family.  Millions of them put off the family for too long, until it was too late, and regretted their choice.  Others had children in their forties when their own parents were too old to be hands-on grandparents.  The second wave taught that women could be as sexually promiscuous as men without consequences.  But there were consequences: STDs, drug abuse, loss of self-respect.  And now we have the third wave, a complete turnabout, in which young women must be shielded from offensive words and ""trigger warned "" in case there may come by something offensive in a work of literature (so many books they cannot read!) or in a campus speaker who may have views antithetical to their own.

Feminist culture has created women who would be unrecognizable to the women of the American past – women of the Colonial, Revolutionary, Civil War and industrial, WWI, and WWII eras.  Those women were tough, strong, and competent, whether they had educations or not.  And their lives were truly difficult in countless ways women of today cannot imagine.

Women of the twenty-first century have so much for which to be eternally grateful, but it seems all the feminists among us do is complain about the silliest, most irrelevant things.  They have won on every front but cannot stop whining.  If Hillary wins the election, their lives are not going to be better; they will be decidedly worse – less free, less secure economically, and less safe, for them and their families.  There will be more chaos in the Middle East and around the world.

Trump's past behavior is odious, but he is the only option at this late date.  He just might turn things around.  Hillary will double down on all of Obama's failed policies.

100612,1008,Hillary and the fundamental legal premise of tyranny,http://www.americanthinker.com/articles/2016/10/hillary_and_the_fundamental_legal_premise_of_tyranny.html,22,"We now know that the FBI's dereliction of duty regarding Hillary Clinton's e-mail malfeasance is complete.  Not only did Director James Comey have the gall to explain her guilt in the very statement in which he announced that he (against the better judgment of some agents) would not recommend charges against her, but the FBI actually agreed to destroy laptops containing relevant evidence, thereby handicapping any future investigation.

Loyal Democrat voters could breathe easily again.  For months, they had squirmed under the awkward burden of knowing their presidential nominee had been caught violating federal law. Let me emphasize that point.  They were not afraid their nominee had broken the law; they believed, as we all did, that she had broken it.  (Not only do I feel confident in asserting that most of Clinton's supporters know she violated the law; in assuming this, I am actually applying the principle of charity, as I am granting that her supporters have enough common sense to see the obvious.)  The important question in their minds was whether she would actually be prosecuted for her violation, as any of us would certainly be in like circumstances.

Not that a prosecution would have changed anyone's voting preference, mind you.  After all, Democrat voters, like most products of late modernity's progressive socialization process, have long-since accepted that the privileged members of the ruling political and corporate elite cannot be held to the same moral or legal standards as the rest of us.  These voters wouldn't want to think the teenager who made their fast food burgers had been shoplifting from a convenience store.  But knowing that they are about to give the most powerful office on Earth to a serial violator of federal law -- even of a law with the ominous title ""The Espionage Act"" -- causes nary a twinge of self-doubt.

For you see, they, and we, all feel, deep in our hearts, that the teenager at the burger joint, the middle manager at the bank, the construction worker, the housewife, the small business owner, the nurse, and we ourselves, being mere ordinary people, are subject to the laws of our respective communities, whereas the progressive elite -- the elect and the elected -- are above the law.  We all instinctively sense that among the elite, crime and punishment are mere political ploys.  The progressive Republican Party hoped to have Clinton prosecuted for the same reason the progressive Democratic Party wanted to have Congressman Tom Delay prosecuted: it's good electoral strategy.

The loyal Democrat voters' only concern was the pragmatic question of whether they would have to vote for Hillary without knowing the outcome of her trial, not whether a woman who flaunts her disdain for the laws and security of her country has any business running for office.  Having been spared this discomfort by the powers that be, they could finally rally behind her ""historic campaign"" with vigor.  They were relieved not because she was innocent, but because, though obviously guilty by any standard applicable to ordinary people, Clinton, who is not of ordinary blood, would not have to deal with any ""October surprise"" publicity in the form of a prosecution.

This is not a victory of justice, a category that does not apply to the elite, much as Aristotle says it does not apply to the gods.  It is a victory of politics, of electoral gamesmanship.  Hillary had her pieces lined up in a way that allowed her to get away (again!) with acts that, in the bygone age of equality before the law, might have landed her in prison.  Two points for her!

In the aftermath of the 2012 presidential election, I wrote that America had voted to end modern civilization -- literally, that a major world-historical shift had, for the first time, been effected by means of a democratic election.  America, the planet's last principled guardian of modernity's political victories -- natural equality, individual sovereignty, limited republican government -- was faced with the choice of reelecting or rejecting a Marxist president supported by the Communist Party, who had promised to fundamentally transform the country and used his first term to begin fulfilling that promise.  She voted to stay the course, although the course, in this case, meant an ever-accelerating descent toward the abyss of Ronald Reagan's projected ""thousand years of darkness.""

When I wrote that assessment in 2012, many dismissed my thesis as poetic excess or a passing mood evoked by a disappointing election result.  Wrong.  ""Disappointing"" is a word we use to describe a result that might realistically have turned out otherwise.  Watching your favorite baseball team being eliminated from the playoffs is disappointing.  Finding out the new owners of your favorite restaurant have changed the recipes is disappointing.  But watching a glorious seven-hundred-year historical arc exhausting itself at last; seeing the immense intellectual achievements of philosophers and artists from Aquinas and Dante to Locke and Swift being snuffed out in favor of neo-Marxist critical theory and the nihilistic, infantilizing vulgarity of our popular entertainment; and observing in real time the final outcome of the civilized world's two-hundred-year submersion in the moral quicksand of government-controlled child-rearing (i.e., public school), is not ""disappointing.""  It is revelatory.

What has been revealed is that this age has tempted fate too long.  Tocqueville's prediction, more than one hundred seventy-five years ago, about the peculiar threat to political freedom, namely the successful free people's careless slide into the comfortable compliance of soft despotism, has not merely proved correct; it has perhaps become irreversible.  (If you think Donald Trump can reverse it, or would even care to, I'll grant that this is a moment for grasping at straws if ever there was one; for my part, I am inclined to see him as, in effect if not in intention, the best friend Hillary Clinton ever had.)  The disaster must play itself out, one way or another.  The American majority, primed over generations for this moment, is finally embracing its demise, and therefore indirectly the demise of the entire civilized world, which for generations has stupidly and ungraciously enjoyed its Doomsday Eve party primarily on America's dime.

One of the chief, and most irreversible, symptoms of modernity's decay is the abandonment of the premise of all justice in a modern free society, namely equality before the law.  When a majority of men accept the immunity of their ""betters"" to federal law, not merely as a practical fact of political corruption but as a forgivable and overlookable reality -- that is, as acceptable -- you can be sure you are witnessing a society in freefall.  For its majority has succumbed to the fundamental legal premise of tyranny, which means men have rationalized their own enslavement.

The Doomsday Eve party is winding down.  The remaining drunken revelers, exhausted by excess and having crossed the line between Dionysian freedom and Dionysian chaos, are slowly being delivered into a long, much-needed sleep.  Not a very restful one, I'm afraid.

100613,1009,THE PRESIDENTIAL CHARACTER,http://www.powerlineblog.com/archives/2016/10/the-presidential-character.php,22,"Surveying the electoral scene of the moment summons to mind Henry Adams’s mordant observation that the progression of presidents from George Washington to Ulysses S. Grant was a sufficient refutation of the theory of evolution. What would Adams think of our current candidates?

I’m with John about the utter shamelessness and hypocrisy of the left over revelations and allegations of Trump’s bad behavior. It’s disgusting, to use one of The Donald’s favorite adjectives, as well as being transparent. But you could see this coming 100 miles away. There has been talk for months that the left would roll out “War on Women 2.0” against Trump, but the brazenness of this attack is amazing even for the shameless left.

First, the NBC News “Access Hollywood” tape, which credible reports say was being held in reserve for maximum effect, comes out on Friday. Then in the debate on Sunday, Anderson Cooper pressed Trump hard on the question of whether he had ever had inappropriate or unwanted physical contact with any women. It was the most obvious set-up since O.J.’s lawyers asked Mark Fuhrman whether he’d ever used the “n-word.” What was Trump supposed to say? Maybe that he behaved to the presidential standard of JFK and Bill Clinton? That might have been fun. Take the Fifth Amendment, as Mark Fuhrman subsequently did in the O.J. trial? You can’t take the Fifth Amendment in a presidential campaign (unless you are an aide to Hillary Clinton).

You absolutely knew what was coming next, and the New York Times obliged with the story two days ago about several women “coming forward” to make allegations about Trump. The allegations seem plausible to me, in general if not in every detail, but as the cliché goes, “I question the timing.” The Times sure was able to bring this story out quickly. Usually they spend a long time on a story of this magnitude, which makes you wonder whether this came to them pre-packaged, or have decided actually to follow their executive editor’s advice to take sides openly in this election.

Is there anything here that we didn’t already know about Trump? I think I’ve been even-handed about Trump in my serial analysis of him here on Power Line, and I will have more to say between now and election day both pro and con, but for today it suffices to say that Republicans could have avoided this disaster if they took more seriously the question of character in selecting a nominee.

By coincidence, I wrote an essay on presidential character for ISI’s Intercollegiate Review, not with Trump in mind specifically (I wrote it months ago, when the GOP contest was still in doubt), and it came out from behind the subscription paywall today. Here are a couple relevant passages, but I invite you to read the whole thing:

The character of the individuals who seek the presidency cannot be understood apart from the character of the office itself—both what it was designed to be and what it has become. The Founders would be appalled by the modern presidency, which bears little relation to the office the framers of the Constitution created.

The behavior of most modern presidents and candidates—personally ambitious politicians making populist appeals and offering lavish promises, often impossible to fulfill, of what they will do for the people—is precisely what the Founders wanted to avoid when they established the presidency. . .

Our inflated expectations of presidents, together with inflated presidential promises to solve the nation’s problems, probably have contributed to the loss of public confidence in the federal government. The single most salient fact of the past fifty years may well be the survey results showing that public confidence in the ability of the federal government to perform well has declined dramatically, from nearly 70 percent in 1960 to less than 20 percent over the past twenty years. The one sustained reversal of this trend came during Ronald Reagan’s presidency, and it is probably not a coincidence that Reagan’s core message, stated directly in his first inaugural address, was that the American people themselves, and not Washington, would fix the nation’s serious problems. . .

After Barack Obama—after three generations of progressivism only slightly interrupted by the Reagan years—the conservative president we desperately need requires a paradoxical combination of boldness and restraint. The president will need to be bold in challenging the runaway power and reach of his or her own branch, against the fury of the bureaucracy, its client groups, and the media. This boldness is necessary to restore the proper kind of restraint that a republican executive should have in our constitutional order.

It is not clear where such a person might come from. The supply of people who understand this seems very short indeed."
100614,1009,WIKILEAKS: PODESTA AGREED THAT IRAN DEAL IS DISASTROUS,http://www.powerlineblog.com/archives/2016/10/wikileaks-podesta-agreed-that-iran-deal-is-disastrous.php,22,"Among the recent WikiLeaks documents is an exchange between John Podesta, Hillary Clinton’s campaign manager, and John Anzalone of something called Anzalone Liszt Grove Research. Anzalone sent Podesta an email that consisted of a quote from Sen. Mark Kirk contained in a BuzzFeed article about the Iran deal. Analone also included a link to the article.

In the quoted portion of the article, Kirk said that the Iran deal “condemns the next generation to cleaning up a nuclear war in the Persian Gulf.” Kirk added: “This is the greatest appeasement since Chamberlain gave Czechoslovakia to Hitler.”

Podesta responded to this email by saying: “Yup.”

Hillary Clinton backed the Iran deal and continues to. Nor is she alone. Virtually the entire Democratic Party publicly supports this disastrous agreement.

Neither Podesta nor the Clinton campaign has denied the authenticity of the email exchange, according to this report from a Chicago television station. Instead, Podesta condemned Russia for the leaks which he says are designed to help Donald Trump.

Regardless of how one views the leaks, many of them have been enlightening. The Podesta-Anzalone exchange is no exception. I see no explanation for Podesta’s “yup” other than his concurrence with Sen. Kirk’s grim assessment of the Iran deal. Thus, we can conclude that Podesta agreed with Kirk that the centerpiece of President Obama’s foreign policy, supported by Hillary Clinton, is atrocious.

I wonder whether Hillary agrees. If so, it’s another example of her duplicity, but also a rare instance of sound judgment."
100615,1009,"MEMORY LANE, WITH A SUGGESTION FOR TRUMP AND A CARTOON",http://www.powerlineblog.com/archives/2016/10/memory-lane-with-a-suggestion-for-trump-and-a-cartoon.php,22,"It is interesting to see the news dominated by allegations of sexual boorishness by Donald Trump. Some of us are old enough to remember when Bill Clinton was disbarred and fined $90,000 because he committed perjury in a sexual harassment case. In those days, of course, Democrats insisted all of that was “just about sex,” and demanded that we stop talking about it. Same with the Lolita Express, I guess.

That was then and this is now. Or, more pertinently, that was a Democrat and this is a Republican. So here is an idea: Trump should point out that he was a Democrat when the boorishness in question happened (or didn’t), and therefore it is dirty pool to mention those events. Or else he can say that since then he has reformed his behavior, as well as his politics.

Meanwhile, Hillary Clinton appears to have stopped campaigning. She has no public appearances scheduled prior to the final presidential debate. Apparently she is happy to let the press campaign for her. Michael Ramirez comments; click to enlarge:"
100616,1010,All the assault and harassment allegations against Donald Trump,https://thinkprogress.org/all-the-assault-and-harassment-allegations-against-donald-trump-93f05679365#.ciwvlkz60,22,"With less than a month until Election Day, Donald Trump’s campaign took a turn this week as multiple women have come forward with allegations of assault and harassment against the Republican nominee.
Since the Washington Post published audio last week of Trump bragging about assault, the number of women sharing their stories has multiplied. Trump calls it “locker room talk” and “just words,” but dozens of women claim otherwise.
Some say Trump forced himself on them, kissing and groping them in his luxury hotels or touching them in nightclubs. Others say he walked in on them changing for a Miss USA pageant and looked up women’s skirts at restaurants. Here is a comprehensive timeline to all of the alleged incidents that have been shared so far: The incidents range from the late 1980s to just a few years ago, and the accusers include both Trump’s ex-wife and total strangers.
Trump has denied all of the allegations, instead choosing to smear the women. “These events never, ever happened, and the people that said them, meekly, fully understand,” Trump said on Thursday. “You take a look at these people, you study these people, and you’ll understand also.”"
100617,1010,Trump campaign says it has secret evidence to disprove women’s sexual assault claims,https://thinkprogress.org/trump-secret-evidence-sexual-assault-9a5edea8094d#.1y1n86m6o,22,"Days after an unearthed video revealed that Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump boasted in 2005 that he sexually assaults women, and a slew of women came forward to say that they were among his victims, the Trump campaign says it has evidence that will prove that these women (and he) were lying.
On Thursday, Trump suggested in a campaign speech that he could not have sexually assaulted these women because they are too ugly and threatened to sue the media for publishing their claims. But now, he and his surrogates are promising something even better: documentary proof that he never sexually assaulted any of the myriad women who have come forward.
“ We already have substantial evidence to dispute these lies, and it will be made public in an appropriate way and at an appropriate time_—_very soon,” Trump pledged at a West Palm Beach rally.
Jerry Falwell Jr., president of Liberty University and a member of Trump’s “Evangelical executive advisory board” told CNN’s The Hour that Trump (who as recently as 2013 testified that he almost never uses email) had told him he has exculpatory electronic messages.
“He told me about emails he had from these accusers who wanted to work for him after the supposed event had occurred. And he told me about other email evidence that supports the fact that it didn’t happen,” Falwell said.
On Friday morning, Trump’s running mate Mike Pence told CBS’ This Morning that the secret evidence would come in a Friday news dump. “Before the day is out, there’ll be more evidence publicly that calls into question these latest allegations,” Pence promised. “Stay tuned. I know there’s more information that’s going to be coming out that will back his claim that this is all categorically false.”
But while it is possible that Trump’s accusers might each have emailed Trump to thank him for not sexually assaulting them, in the past he has frequently boasted of having secret information that somehow never materializes.
Last summer, after his nativist campaign kickoff speech included claims that most Mexican immigrants were drug smugglers, rapists, and criminals, CNN’s Anderson Cooper asked Trump to prove these claims. “Well, you’re going to find out if I have evidence. I’m not telling you now, but you’re going to find out what I have,” he vowed. No proof has been produced.
Well after President Obama released his long-form birth certificate, Trump tweeted in August 2012 that he had inside information to prove that the document was fraudulent. Four years later, he has still not identified the “extremely credible source” or any evidence of this claim.Trump now pretends this never happened and that his birther obsession ended in 2011.
The Wall Street Journal reported on Thursday night that Trump will blame the allegations on a complicated conspiracy involving the Clinton campaign, the New York Times, and its minority shareholder Mexican billionaire Carlos Slim."

On MNSBC’s Morning Joe on Friday, Trump surrogate Ben Carson took a quite literal approach to this type of silencing.
Instead of answering a question about his position that Trump’s accusers are lying_—_and that the accusations are ultimately unimportant because of the country’s national debt_—_Carson demanded that BBC World News America anchor Katty Kay’s microphone be cut off. During his appearance on MSNBC, Carson referenced a debunked right-wing theory that says that Trump couldn’t have assaulted one of the women, Jessica Leeds, on an airplane in the 70s because the armrest wouldn’t have been able to move. Then, he pivoted from smearing the women to suggesting sexual assault isn’t important because we have national debt.
Before “nations fall,” Carson said, “they take their eye off the ball, start engaging in things that really don’t matter that much. Not that, you know, sexual language and abuses is not important, but when you are talking about the train going off the cliff, you really need to deal with that first.” “You seem to suggest this morning in your interview with the description of the first class cabin and previous interviews that these women are lying,” Katty Kay said. “The real reason women who have been sexually abused don’t come forward is precisely this, all too much they’re accused of being liars. Are you saying these women are lying?”
Instead of answering the question, Carson demanded that Kay’s mic be cut off.
“Hey, can you turn her microphone off, please?” he said. “Turn her microphone off so I can talk.” After Carson left, Joe Scarborough debriefed with Kay.
“I don’t think I’ve ever had anybody tell me to turn my microphone off before. That’s censorship,” she said. “A form of censorship in response to a very simple question…which he never answered.” Since the news broke of Trump caught on tape bragging about what amounts to sexual assault, the campaign has been coming up with some creative excuses for his behavior. They’ve insisted that Trump’s comments were “just words, not actions,” despite the number of women now coming forward with accounts of groping and nonconsensual touching, and normalized Trump’s comments as typical “locker room talk” and something “all men do.”
Some have even characterized Trump’s comments as “macho,” as Pat Robertson put it, or “alpha,” as Trump’s son and surrogate Eric Trump said, implying that Trump was just being “manly.” On local radio on Wednesday, Trump supporter Carl Paladino said Trump was just “showing his sexual prowess.”
The campaign has also threatened to sue women for coming forward. Trump supporter and Fox Business anchor Lou Dobbs doxxed one of the women on his Twitter account. As Kay told Carson, these are precisely the reasons women don’t come forward with sexual assault accusations: because most often they are accused of lying, exaggerating or are punished for speaking out.
It’s also textbook rape culture, according the National Sexual Violence Resource Center communications director Laura Palumbo. Rape culture, she told ThinkProgress via email, “is reinforced by attitudes that normalize violence, myths about sexual violence, blaming victims and devaluing women.”
“Comments that minimize the significance of sexual violence create feelings of shame and fear, and keep victims silent_—_which in turn keeps people who cause harm invisible.”"

It’s crazy enough that polling shows Hillary Clinton with a lead in Arizona, while only lagging Missouri by five. Those may be Red states, but they were already in the “possible” category, especially Arizona. 

But Donald Trump’s numbers are cratering so hard, that we’ve got some particularly crazy deep-Red states suddenly threatening to be in contention.

ALASKA. Yes, Alaska. 

Trump led the pack with 36.1 percent, followed by Democrat Hillary Clinton at 30.6 percent, Libertarian Gary Johnson at 17.9 percent and Green Party nominee Jill Stein at 6 percent. Nine percent were undecided.
The poll was conducted after the first debate, but before all the latest crazy. 

INDIANA. Yes, Indiana.

Indiana was never supposed to be competitive, even before Donald Trump tapped its governor as his running mate.  The latest Monmouth University Poll throws those expectations out the window.  Trump currently leads Hillary Clinton by a slim 4 points [45-41], down from his 11 point lead in August. 
Not only is Clinton creeping closer, but “Democrat” Evan Bayh leads the Senate race 48-42 and, amazingly, Democratic gubernatorial candidate John Gregg leads his GOPer opponent 50-38. 

TEXAS. Yes, freakin’ TEXAS! 

The WFAA/SurveyUSA poll found Trump beating Clinton 47 percent to 43 percent — a remarkably close margin in a state that the last two GOP nominees carried by double digits [...]

The 4-point margin may be Trump’s smallest lead in Texas yet, but it is not far from what prior polls have found. Trump has consistently led Clinton by single digits, including by 7 points in a KTVT-CBS 11/Dixie Strategies Poll released Oct. 5
(More here.)

Utah. Yes, Utah, but for a weird reason.

Among Utah voters likely to cast ballots in November's presidential election, 34% currently support Trump, 28% back Clinton, 20% back McMullin, and 9% support Libertarian Gary Johnson. 
Gotta give it to the Mormons—they don’t like Hillary Clinton as much as the next arch-conservative. But unlike the Falwells of the Christian Right who refuse to reassess their support for Trump, Mormons are struggling to reconcile Trump with their faith—and their faith is winning!

Clinton is shy of where she’ll end up, still consolidating the small pockets of Democratic support in places like Salt Lake City and Grand County (where Moab is located). President Barack Obama got 34 percent in Utah in 2008, without a Mormon at the top of the ticket. Expect Clinton to get there. So the big question is whether Utah-centric spoiler Evan McMullin will take enough of the conservative Mormon vote to hand the state to Clinton (or even win it himself, outright). 

So there you have it. Four states that should be nowhere near contention. Four states that are more winnable for Hillary Clinton than must-win states for Trump like Pennsylvania. 

Clinton doesn’t need them, but with hot Senate, governor and/or House races in all of them, contesting them is a scrumptious cherry on top. Not to mention, if these states are in play, what other non-polled states and races are also in play? That’s why it’s important, people, to do what you can on behalf of our ticket. Each little GOTV act you take is like throwing a tiny little anvil at a drowning GOP. Throw enough of these tiny anvils, and we’ve got a big anvil. Than a yuge anvil. A tremendous anvil. The biggest! So do it! And let’s make this happen:"

Partial transcript as follows: 

I’ve got news for you. You may not have a place in Hillary Clinton’s America. She has her own war on women. Evidence: what the women Bill Clinton violated said about her. She even has her own war on religion. The woman is utterly against religious liberty. No surprise there, since it’s her pal Barack Obama whose policy she wants to continue, who took the Little Sisters of the Poor to the United States Supreme Court to force them to provide contraceptives and the morning after pill under Obamacare to their employees, a violation of their religious beliefs.

Evidence: WikiLeaks this week. The communications director, along with a now campaign chairman for Hillary Clinton and a Democratic strategist mock Catholics and evangelical Christians for quote, “their backward views.” Their anti-Christian bigotry is palpable. They, Hillary and her gang, talk of a need for a Catholic spring and a desire to plant the seeds of a revolution in Catholic teaching — reminiscent of the Arab spring, that they were complicit in in the Middle East — which is now in chaos. The same people who fret after Americans are killed, whose worst fear is not the Americans who were killed, but an anti-Muslim backlash. the same group that told American Christians in a national prayer breakfast, “You Christians, you get off your high horses” after we were being beheaded by Muslims. Are any of you confident that this woman will appoint Supreme Court justices who are going to protect your First Amendment religious liberty?"

Clinton’s statement is significant because it suggests that, according to polling data, Clinton views an overwhelming majority of the American electorate to be “fundamentally un-American.” According to data from Pew Research Center, 83% of the American electorate would like to see immigration levels frozen or reduced.

VIDEO: CLINTON VOWS TO FIGHT FOR DISABLED AMERICANS

Clinton’s declaration describing those who want to limit immigration as “unAmerican” came in the context of her urging action on “immigration reform.”

“Immigration reform is so important,” Clinton told the Wall Street executives, as she demanded that Congress “get immigration reform done.”

By “immigration reform,” Clinton was referring to the 2013 Rubio-Schumer proposal, which she supported and which would have granted immediate amnesty and eventual citizenship to millions of illegal aliens, would have doubled the annual admission of foreign workers, and would have dispensed 33 million green cards to foreign nationals in the span of a single decade despite current record immigration levels.

Clinton went on to suggest that those who oppose such dramatic expansions to immigration are “fundamentally un-American”:

What I really resent most about the obstructionists is they have such a narrow view of America. They see America in a way that is no longer reflective of the reality of who we are. They’re against immigration for reasons that have to do with the past, not the future. They can’t figure out how to invest in the future, so they cut everything. You know, laying off, you know, young researchers, closing labs instead of saying, we’re better at this than anybody in the world, that’s where our money should go. They just have a backward-looking view of America. And they play on people’s fears, not on people’s hopes, and they have to be rejected. I don’t care what they call themselves. I don’t care where they’re from. They have to be rejected because they are fundamentally unAmerican.”

This is not the first time she has described sectors of the American electorate as “unAmerican.” At a September fundraiser earlier this year, Clinton described Trump supporters as “deplorable,” and “irredeemable, but thankfully they are not America,” Clinton said.

During her Goldman Sachs speech, Clinton went on to argue that being “American” is not a national identity, but rather is “an intellectual invention.”

“American was an invention,” Clinton declared. “It was an intellectual invention, and we have done pretty well for all these years. And these people want to just undermine that very profound sense of who we are. And we can’t let them do that. So it’s not just about politics or partisanship. It really goes to the heart of what it means to be American.”

Clinton’s declaration seems to echo a sentiment that has been expressed by mass migration enthusiast Republican House Speaker Paul Ryan.

Paul Ryan, like Clinton, has previously suggested that America is not a country or a national identity, but is rather an intellectual idea.

“America is more than just a country,” Ryan said just a few months before Clinton delivered her speech to Goldman Sachs. “It’s more than Chicago, or Wisconsin. It’s more than our borders. America is an idea. It’s a very precious idea.”

Ryan’s statement came as he was stumping for the Rubio-Schumer immigration agenda in 2013 with open borders advocate Luis Gutierrez, who has since endorsed Hillary Clinton for President over Donald Trump. Gutierrez was also one of the first members of Congress to endorse Ryan for House Speaker–Gutierrez has called Ryan his “good friend” and “guiding light” on immigration.

Ryan’s statement is significant because while a country has borders, “ideas” do not. If America is an “idea” rather than a “country” that means that refugees in Somali have as much “right” to a job in the United States as the children of the American revolution.

Indeed, like Clinton, Speaker Ryan has a long record of pushing to expand record-high immigration levels and advocating for open borders. This goal is shared by Hillary Clinton, who went so far as to privately tell foreign bankers that her “dream” was to enact “open borders.”

Several reports have documented how immigration is not the only issue of agreement between Paul Ryan and Hillary Clinton. As Breitbart News has extensively documented, Ryan’s views on foreign migration, foreign trade, and foreign wars more closely align with the views of Hillary Clinton than they do with the views of Donald Trump and the Republican electorate. Indeed, Sen. Tim Kaine has predicted that Speaker Ryan will be the key to passing a President Hillary Clinton’s agenda–including enacting the largest amnesty in U.S. history within her first 100 days in office.

The overwhelming similarities between the goals of establishment leaders in both political parties and the goals of their wealthy corporate donors, like Goldman Sachs, recently prompted Green Party presidential nominee Jill Stein to denounce Hillary Clinton as a “corporatist” and the face of “#TheNewRepublicanParty.”

“Both Democrats and Republicans are funded by big corporate interests,” Stein has written, noting that these members of Washington’s “uniparty” are united in their shared desire to advance the goals of their wealthy donors rather than the desires of the people.

Bernie Sanders has previously explained how open borders–backed by both Clinton and Ryan–is a “Koch brothers proposal” that would dissolve national sovereignty and “would make everybody in America poorer” by allowing corporations to “bring in all kinds of people [who would] work for $2 or $3 an hour” and would drive down wages for American workers.

By Bernie Sanders’ own argument, Hillary Clinton’s “dream” is to enact a policy that would “make everybody in America poorer” and would do “away with the concept of [the United States as] a nation state.”

As a result of current federal policy, every year the U.S. issues one million plus new green cards; admits one million foreign workers, refugees, and dependents; and imports half a million foreign youths sought by college administrators. In 1970, fewer than one in 21 Americans were foreign-born, but today, as a result of the federal government’s four-decade-long green card gusher, nearly one in seven U.S. residents was born in a foreign country.

Alabama Senator Jeff Sessions has explained that, far from being “fundamentally unAmerican,” recognizing limits and curbing immigration to protect American jobs and wages is “rational” and is the “mainstream” view held by most Americans.

“It is not mainstream, but extreme, to continue surging immigration beyond all historical precedent. And it is not rational, but radical, to refuse to recognize limits,” Sessions has explained.

Sessions has previously noted that Clinton’s desire to expand immigration beyond all-known historical precedent place her at odds with the vast majority of the American electorate. “Hillary Clinton has embraced a radical and extreme open borders agenda that, properly exposed, will make her un-electable,” Sessions has said."

Reacting to recent Wikileaks revelations that show Hillary’s campaign team mocking conservative Catholics and boasting of subverting Church teaching, the Archbishop penned an article blasting the Democrat machine and suggesting that as bad as things have been under Obama, Hillary could make them worse.
Video: Pence Denounces Clinton Aide’s Anti-Catholic E-Mail

Despite the immense “cultural damage” brought about by the current White House, Chaput writes, with the “contemptuously anti-Catholic emails” of Hillary’s campaign team, “bad can always get worse.” In fact, in the view of many people, Chaput had written earlier, Hillary “should be under criminal indictment.”

Chaput quotes at length an email he received from a non-Catholic attorney, who assured him that these “bigots are actively strategizing how to shape Catholicism not to be Catholic.”

“They are, at the very core, trying to turn religion to their secular view of right and wrong consistent with their politics,” he quotes. “We have political actors trying to orchestrate a coup to destroy Catholic values, and they even analogize their takeover to a coup in the Middle East, which amplifies their bigotry and hatred of the Church.”

This week’s leaked emails included boasts by Clinton campaign chairman John Podesta that he had set up two phony “Catholic” organizations in order to bring about a revolution in the Catholic Church.

In his article, Chaput writes that he had had personal experience with members of one of the groups, Catholics United, who came to him in 2008 trying to convince him to downplay the abortion issue.

With their “servile partisan hustling,” the Archbishop writes, Catholics United helped “elect an administration that has been the most stubbornly unfriendly to religious believers, institutions, concerns and liberty in generations.”

Referring to a Wikileaks email from the Hillary camp railing against Catholics’ “systematic thought and severely backwards gender relations,” Chaput notes that “it would be wonderful for the Clinton campaign to repudiate the content of these ugly WikiLeaks emails,” which he knows will never happen.

All of us “backward-thinking Catholics who actually believe what Scripture and the Church teach would be so very grateful,” he declares.

The Archbishop is no fan of Donald Trump. He appropriates the words of a “friend” who describes the choice facing voters in November as between “a vulgar, boorish lout and disrespecter of women, with a serious impulse control problem” and “a scheming, robotic liar with a lifelong appetite for power and an entourage riddled with anti-Catholic bigots.”

Still, when November 8 rolls around, one Catholic prelate has made it clear he won’t be “with her.”"
100623,1003,Donald Trump Doesn’t Understand ISIS or Who Created It,http://www.huffingtonpost.com/paul-heroux/donald-trump-doesnt-under_b_12502950.html?utm_hp_ref=politics,23,"Donald Trump repeatedly makes the false claim that President Obama founded ISIS. This is absolutely absurd by any stretch of how he tries to spin it. But where did ISIS come from?

ISIS is in Iraq and Syria and many other countries. Trump likes to state that the vacuum the was left after the US troops withdrew from Iraq under Obama resulted in the creation of ISIS. This is not what happened and the growth of ISIS can be traced back decades.

The Backdrop

When the Grand Mosque in Mecca was seized in November 1979, Saudi Arabia decided that to appeal to the religious right, the ruling family would support the strict version of Islam commonly known as Wahhabism (or known in Saudi Arabia as muwahhidun, which is the ‘oneness of god’). The next month in December 1979, after the Soviet invasion of Afghanistan the Saudi Arabia government encouraged many disaffected youth to take up arms in Afghanistan, fulfilling their pledge to encourage religious extremism. At the same time, Saudi Arabia funded mosques and madrassas all over the world to promote this extreme version of Islam.

Throughout the 1980s, mujahideen, or holy warriors, flocked to Afghanistan to support their fellow Muslims. The most famous was probably Osama bin Laden. Shortly after the end of the war when the USSR left Afghanistan in 1989, Iraq invaded Kuwait in 1990. This was a good opportunity for Bin Laden and database of soldiers, many of whom saw little action in Afghanistan, to come to the defense of Kuwait. Bin Laden was rebuffed and the US led coalition was chosen. That database of soldiers is where the name Al Qaeda comes from; Al Qaeda means “the base.”

Al Qaeda was then active throughout the 1990s and peaked in 2001. After the 9/11 attacks in 2001, the US invaded under false pretenses Iraq in search of WMD. On 9/11, there were no WMD in Iraq and Al Qaeda was not operating in Iraq either. After the 2003 US invasion of Iraq, Al Qaeda flocked to Iraq to attack and kill US troops. Over the presidency of George W. Bush, the war in Iraq became unpopular at home and in Iraq. A withdrawal timetable was created and US troops were scheduled by President Bush to leave Iraq in 2011.

ISIS Is Born

Several of the terrorists, mainly Abu Musab al-Zarqawi who in Jordan in 1999 founded Jama’at al-Tawhid wal-Jihad, which had a partnership with Al Qaeda; Zarqawi renamed his organization Al Qaeda in Iraq. He fought against the US in Iraq starting in 2003-2004, which eventually led to different objectives and his new faction eventually called itself Islamic State in 2006, well before Obama was president. Eventually, IS made their way over to Syria, which was becoming a failed state starting in March 2011. Concurrently, after the US left Iraq in 2011 IS moved east into Iraq in 2013 from Syria and started calling itself ISIS. It was now the Islamic State of Iraq and Syria. With the dictatorships that created stability in Middle East collapsing, eventually, ISIS grew and its reach went beyond Syria and Iraq. ISIS was renamed to ISIL, which meant Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant. Now some people just refer to the organization just as Islamic State.

So, the claim that President Obama created ISIS/ISIL/IS is just not a reflection of what happened in reality."
100624,1003,Thank Goodness For Protracted US Elections,http://www.huffingtonpost.com/stephen-schlesinger/thank-goodness-for-protra_b_12503904.html?utm_hp_ref=politics,23,"American politics has often been criticized for the length of its presidential campaigns. Today a serious bid for the White House can last up two or so years before the election. In parliamentary nations, on the other hand, a contest usually goes on for less than three months. Furthermore, the amount of money to sustain such lengthy battles in the US, enable a candidate to continue through dozens of primaries and make an all-out final sprint to voting day, involves staggering amounts of money. But, for all of its faults, there is one important upside to these stretched-out affairs - the candidate’s character and flaws eventually come through to the public over the period.

This has been especially evident in the Hillary-Clinton versus Donald Trump showdown. Clinton has been on the political playing field for almost forty years, and so is well-known for her personality, her views, her past controversies and her campaign abilities. However in the case of Donald Trump, a newcomer to American politics, the man’s misogamy, racism, support of violence, narcissism, and mendacity all have became exposed through daily media coverage, debates, the rise of his supporters like White Supremacists and other fringe groups, the reports of his own bankruptcies and failure to pay bills, his own fabricated claims and dishonest attacks on opponents and serial lies.

But Trump, even with these drawbacks, still was able to win the Republican nomination. However, the final three months of the presidential race allowed even more damaging information to be disclosed about him, tawdry stories which his Republican foes had never bothered to dig up about him or to address in the primaries. For it is in these final 12 weeks that the news finally broke about his almost $1 billion write-off in his tax returns and about the release of Access Hollywood tape regarding his admission that he sexually abused women. If the campaign had been a matter of three months, Donald Trump might still have a serious chance to win the election - but it wasn’t. In the modern-day American tradition, it has lasted for at least twenty-four months, sufficient amount of time for the details of a candidate’s corrupt background to be openly revealed."
100625,1003,"Trump Tapes, More Than Words to Sexual Assault Victims",http://www.huffingtonpost.com/gvh-live-/trump-tapes-more-than-wor_b_12504372.html?utm_hp_ref=politics,23,"Rosie O’Donnell is a ‘fat pig’. Megyn Kelly must have had ‘blood coming out of her wherever’ when she probed him on his derogatory references to women. Donald Trump’s misogynistic rhetoric had become such a recurrent story this presidential cycle that the American electorate have long since been desensitized by it. There could be no other explanation for the tolerance of his actions, if not desensitization.

That was until last Friday, when The Washington Post unearthed Access Hollywood tape recordings dating back to 2005, exposing another, even more sordid level to Trump’s seemingly unending disrespect for women.

In the tapes he is heard conversing with Billy Bush, of NBC’s “Today”, describing his conquest of women; ‘I just start kissing them... I don’t even wait.’ He went on, saying, ‘Grab them by the p****. You can do anything.’

Unsurprisingly, the reaction to the tapes has been uproar in the media, a suspension of Bush by NBC, Republican Trump endorsers falling at the wayside and a public apology from Trump himself, in which he called his comments ‘locker room banter’. As his campaign continues to scramble to salvage the remaining crumb of credibility he has left, many commentators have been calling for him to pull out of the race altogether.

In the midst of the media circus focused on the welfare of Trump’s campaign, the real issue with his open admittance of sexual assault seems to have been forgotten; the effect of his comments on sexual assault survivors themselves.

‘We know that these kinds of conversations have triggering effects for survivors,’ Director of Media & Strategic Communications for End Rape on Campus Colleen Daly said.

‘It’s very easy, and rightfully so, to be emotionally impacted by those kinds of statements.’ Her observations are validated by the 33% increase in online hotline traffic reported by RAINN, the non-profit which runs the National Sexual Assault Helpline. Social media also saw a huge response, with the hashtag “notokay” retweeted over one million times since the release of the tapes, by survivors sharing their first experiences of sexual assault.

Daly noted the Brock Turner Case at Stanford University as having similar effects. Turner was convicted of sexually assaulting a woman behind a dumpster on campus, and the international attention garnered by his case highlighted the lack of convictions in instances of sexual violence. Daly said, ‘Folks were outraged that Brock Turner was only given six months and then three months of prison time.’

‘However he, according to statistics received more jail time than over 98% of rapists.’

Daly argues that exposing this context on the prevalence of the issue is exactly what we should be doing with Trump’s comments. She said, ‘We know that over 20% of college women are experiencing [sexual violence], and upwards of 30% of women over the course of their lifetime.’

‘These forms of violence are not in any way shape or form unworthy of attention or worthy of being diminished to locker room banter.’

Furthermore she said, ‘focusing on the needs of survivors and ensuring that their voices are heard... and that they’re centred’ in the media is of the utmost importance.

Since the debate on Sunday night in which he denied admitting to sexual assault, two women have spoken out accusing Trump of assaulting them on separate occasions. Trump’s camp call the claims ‘fiction’."
100626,1004,"Report: Trump Wouldn't Stop Calling Lil Jon, 'Uncle Tom' On Apprentice",http://talkingpointsmemo.com/livewire/report-trump-wouldnt-stop-calling-lil-jon-uncle-tom-on-the-apprentice,23,"The Daily Beast reported Friday night that Donald Trump had continuously referred to Lil Jon as ""Uncle Tom"" during the filming of the 13th season of the Apprentice.

Three staffers told the Daily Beast that multiple people on set had tried to tell Trump to stop using the racially-charged term to no avail. According to the Daily Beast, Lil Jon had planned to dress up like Uncle Sam to sell a hair product for the Celebrity Apprentice. When Trump heard, however, he started calling Lil Jon ""Uncle Tom"" instead of Uncle Sam. And, despite correction, Trump kept using the term.

The individuals who spoke to the Daily Beast spoke on background because of The Apprentice's strict non disclosure agreements.

""We kept trying to explain to [Trump] that that’s not a word you can use, that it’s offensive,” an Apprentice employee told The Daily Beast. “One of the executive producers had to call him up directly to [plead with] him not to say it, and Trump was like, ‘No, that’s a saying, it’s Uncle Tom.’ There are several takes in the footage of the dailies that has him trying to figure out the difference between ‘Uncle Tom’ and Uncle Sam. ""

The Daily Beast reported that Lil Jon's publicist did not respond to a request for comment Friday, but on Saturday, the Daily Beast reported that Lil Jon did tweet out a comment confirming the incident and saying that Trump stopped once he addressed him. Trump's campaign strongly denied the claim Friday.

“This is simply untrue,"" Trump spokesperson Hope Hicks told the Daily Beast.

Throughout his campaign, Trump has struggled to earn measurable African-American support. In his attempts to reach out to African-American voters Trump has often relied on stereotypes that African Americans live in crime-ridden and impoverished neighborhoods. In an address aimed at African-Americans, Trump once encouraged them to vote for him because ""what the hell do you have to lose?"""

According to the New York Times, Clinton told volunteers in Seattle that she would spend the final weeks of her campaign trying to help the country repair itself after a bitter election.

""This election is incredibly painful. I take absolutely no satisfaction in what is happening on the other side with my opponent,"" Clinton said, according to the Times. ""I am not at all happy about that because it hurts our country, it hurts our democracy, it sends terrible messages to so many people here at home and around the world.""

At a time when the election seems to be more full of personal attacks than substance, Clinton urged her supporters not to ""turn away"". Instead she asked they ""start looking after each other again.""

""I will be asking for your help. I need your help not just to win this election but to govern and to heal the divides that exist in our country right now,"" Clinton said at a fundraiser earlier in the day, according to the Times. ""I do believe there isn't anything we can't do once we make up our minds to do it.""

Clinton said that there was damage to repair after Trump's candidacy.

""So make no mistake, we do have to repair the damage which he has done, which we will do. But on both domestic and national security grounds, repudiating his candidacy sends exactly the right message,"" she said, according to the Times."

100629,1005,Trump Just Proposed He and Clinton Take Pre-Debate Drug Tests,http://www.motherjones.com/politics/2016/10/trump-says-hillary-doping-debates-and-suggests-they-take-pre-debate-drug-tests-car,23,"At a packed rally in Portsmouth, New Hampshire, on Saturday morning, GOP presidential nominee Donald Trump again denied the slew of sexual misconduct allegations that have emerged against him this past week. But then he changed the subject to one of his favorite talking points: Hillary Clinton's stamina. This time, though, Trump took it further, implying that Clinton took performance-enhancing drugs before the presidential debates. He proposed that they each should be drug-tested prior to the debate this Wednesday.

""I think she is actually getting pumped up,"" he said. ""She's getting pumped up for Wednesday night."" Trump then added, ""We're like athletes, right? Look, I beat 17 senators, governors, all these people....Athletes, they make them take a drug test. I think we should take a drug test prior to the debate. Why don't we do that?""

It may be a pointless question, but what evidence did Trump produce that Clinton is pulling a Lance Armstrong? He claimed that at the start of the last debate she was ""was all pumped up"" but by the end ""she could barely reach her car."" By the way, Trump has yet to make good on his promise to produce his full medical records."
100630,1005,Here's a List of the Information Trump Has Promised but Not Released,http://www.motherjones.com/politics/2016/10/donald-trump-information-promised-tax-returns-not-released,23,"As the allegations of sexual assault piled up against Donald Trump this week, the Republican nominee promised that he would release a trove of exculpatory evidence ""at the appropriate time."" On Friday morning, running mate Mike Pence said this other shoe would drop within ""hours"" and this information would disprove Trump's accusers. By the end of the day, the only information that Trump produced was thin and bizarre. 

The Trump campaign put forward a British man who claimed to have a ""photographic memory"" and who told the New York Post that he was on the flight with Trump and one of Trump's accusers 30-plus years ago, that he remembered the entire incident, and that her story of being groped by Trump while sitting next to the mogul in the first class section was not true. The Brit claimed nothing had happened during the entire flight. (A Trump spokeswoman had previously claimed that Trump did not fly on commercial airlines during the 1980s, so this seemed to prove that Trump's account was wrong.) The British fellow would have been about 18-years-old at the time and didn't explain why he had been flying first-class. And two years ago, he generated British headlines by claiming that when he was 17 he procured young men for sex parties with British politicians. The Trump campaign also released a statement from the cousin of an accuser who had appeared on The Apprentice, and this man asserted that his cousin had for years not complained about Trump and had only raised these allegations after Trump recently declined an invitation to visit her restaurant.

None of this was the firm proof that Trump had promised. And this wasn't the first time that Trump has vowed to release information and then failed to produce the goods. Here's a quick guide:

Tax returns: At the height of his birther crusade in 2011, Trump offered a challenge to President Barack Obama: if the commander-in-chief released his long-form birth certificate, Trump would put out his tax returns. Obama did release a long-form birth certificate, after which point Trump told ABC that he would release his taxes ""at the appropriate time."" That time never came.

Tax returns again: In January Trump said on Meet the Press that he would release his tax returns imminently. ""We're working on that now,"" he said. ""I have big returns, as you know, and I have everything all approved and very beautiful and we'll be working that over in the next period of time."" But after a month passed and he still hadn't produced his tax returns, Trump said at a Republican primary debate that he couldn't release his tax returns because he was under audit. (The IRS has said that an audit would not prevent Trump from releasing the returns.) Running mate Mike Pence and top surrogate Ben Carson have both said Trump will release the returns at ""the appropriate time."" Which brings us to...

Proof he's being audited: Trump promised to release a letter proving that he was under audit. In March, in response to to repeated inquiries and promises to release documentation pertaining to the audit, Trump produced a letter from his lawyer (dated three weeks earlier) saying that his returns from 2009 until the present were under review by the IRS. But Trump's lawyers are paid by Trump. He has not produced any correspondence from the IRS that would confirm an audit was under way.

List of creditors: When NBC News' Lester Holt asked Trump at the first presidential debate why he had not released his tax returns, Trump made a counteroffer: he would release a list of his creditors instead. ""I could give you a list of banks,"" he said. ""I would—if that would help you, I would give you a list of banks. These are very fine institutions, very fine banks. I could do that very quickly."" Three weeks later, though, Trump has still not released that list.

Secret information in Hawaii: In 2011 Trump claimed to have sent investigators to Hawaii to uncover the truth about Obama's birth certificate, and he said he would release the results of their investigation ""at a certain point in time."" No grand announcement ever came. ""He'll reveal it when the time is right,"" Tana Goertz, the co-chair of Trump campaign's in Iowa, told MSNBC last summer. ""If they found something, it will come out. The time isn't right, and guess what? Mr. Trump does what he wants and he's not going to do it on our time. He's going to do it when the timing is perfectly strategic and it's not now and it wasn't the place for him to say it.""

Melania's immigration documents: Following reports that Melania Trump had (illegally) worked in the United States under a tourist visa in the 1990s, Trump vowed to hold a press conference featuring his wife to set the record straight. No press conference ever occurred. Weeks later, the Trump campaign released a statement from her lawyer, but it was accompanied by no corroborating documents.

Medical records: In September, as Trump was claiming that Hillary Clinton was in poor health, ABC' News' David Muir asked why he didn't release his own medical records. ""I might do that, I might do that,"" Trump said. ""In fact, now that you ask, I think I will do that. I'd love to give full reports."" Trump had previously released a one-page letter from his gastroenterologist that was widely dismissed by medical experts as odd and unprofessional, and he later revealed additional medical details (from the same doctor) on Dr. Oz's television show. But Trump has yet to produce a full medical report."
100631,1006,Trump advisor: The media feeding frenzy over sexual assault could be a positive for us,http://hotair.com/archives/2016/10/15/trump-advisor-media-feeding-frenzy-sexual-assault-positive-us/,23,"There are two prongs to the campaign’s strategy the rest of the way, according to a Trump inner-circler who spoke to Yahoo News. One is cynical yet smart, one is … not so smart. The smart part:

Trump’s all-out offensive is not just designed to defend against the groping allegations or to serve red meat to what the source described as his “populist” and “nationalist base.” According to the source, who requested anonymity to discuss high-level strategy candidly, the attacks on the Clintons are also aimed at the “suppression of votes” from millennial women, African-Americans and the “idealistic Bernie Sanders supporter.”…

That’s why many of Trump’s attacks on the Clinton Foundation will focus on its dealings in Haiti and sub-Saharan Africa, particularly Nigeria. The source described these countries as places where the Clintons “treat blacks as people they can make money off.” The source said Trump came up with this line of attack, which he brought up in the last presidential debate, to appoint a special prosecutor as president and potentially jail Hillary Clinton, as he was conducting an event in Miami’s Little Haiti, where locals were venting their dissatisfaction with the Clinton family’s dealings in their country.

The source predicted that these attacks, coupled with Trump’s “populist message,” would help “get 10 to 15 percent of the black vote,” but said that the move was primarily an attempt to get other African-Americans to stay away from the polls on Election Day.
The last bit is unlikely, especially on the high-end estimate, but even if Trump doesn’t cut into Clinton’s share of the black vote he’d benefit greatly if he can demoralize key parts of her base into not turning out. That’s a sound plan for a candidate who may have hit his ceiling in the polls: If you can’t build on your own numbers, try driving down your opponent’s. Highlight Bill Clinton’s accusers to inspire disgust in young women who never learned much about the Clinton scandals; chatter about shenanigans in Haiti and secret speeches to Wall Street to alienate blacks and progressives. In major battlegrounds where the race is tight, i.e. Ohio, North Carolina, and Florida, every liberal who stays home gets Trump an inch closer to winning. And ironically, the predictions lately of electoral doom for Trump might further help him by convincing low-information voters on the left that their votes aren’t needed after all. It’s gonna be a landslide. Why bother getting out of bed on November 8th? Meanwhile, Trump’s polling is more or less steady despite the avalanche of oppo he’s been hit with lately. The liberal base could begin tuning out this month on the assumption that there’s no way Trump can win, only to have him quietly hanging around long enough in the polls to benefit from a major late surprise.

So far, so good. This part, though? Not so good:

But the Trump source played down the political risks of the recent spate of sexual misconduct claims against the Republican nominee, saying that such allegations could help Trump in arguing that he’s a crusading outsider under attack by a fixed system.

“I think it reinforces the fact of — the corporate media/establishment apparatus that we’re against,” the source explained. “Also, remember, you know, we’re not trying to sell Trump to millennial women. That’s the difference. So, does this hurt? We look at it as a positive for the fact of: It’s once again a gang, a pile-on.”
In fairness, the advisor isn’t saying he’s glad the sexual-assault stories are coming out. He’s trying to make lemonade from the lemons he’s been given. There’s a silver lining to the “pile-on,” and it’s the fact that nothing unites Republicans like their shared contempt for the media. But … which Republicans? Trump’s hardcore supporters are already all aboard the Trump train. They would walk through fire to turn out next month, media pile-on or no. It’s the softer supporters he needs to worry about turning out. And as it turns out, bombshells bursting daily about him groping women, “grabbing them by the p***y,” and then mocking his accusers’ looks might not mean a net gain in soft support. Gallup: That period, October 7-11, covers the release of the “Access Hollywood” tape and the second debate but not the sexual assault allegations this week. His rating within his own party could be even lower now. Meanwhile, here’s the trend in Clinton’s favorable rating among Democrats over the same period: Maybe that surge is due to her (highly mediocre) debate performance, but I’d guess it has more to do with Dems getting revved up to beat Trump after the tape came out. And although his polling hasn’t tanked overall, there were individual polls that came out this week suggesting a sharp dive — most notably Fox News, which now has him down seven points nationally after he trailed by two just a week before. The Trump advisor who spoke to Yahoo News is betting, essentially, that media-bashing will win you more votes in a general election than a weeks-long scandal involving damaging audio followed by daily accusations of sexual misconduct will lose you. That might be true in a Republican primary, embarrassingly, but it’s not true when the other parties get to vote too.

And at least one person close to the top seems to know it: The Trump advisor quoted up top claims that Conway is all aboard with the campaign’s strategy, but that tweet feels like a wink to the media that she knows Trump rambling at length about the accusations against him at his rallies is, well, nuts. (This short Twitter thread about the game Conway is playing with the media is incisive, and worth your time.) That’s the other weird thing about treating the media pile-on as a “positive.” It’s fine to deflect questions about the allegations by bashing the media when they ask about it, but it’s beyond stupid for Trump to introduce the subject himself at his events. Like Conway says, he should be full bore on his core issues — build the wall, Clinton is corrupt, it’s time for a change from the corrupt status quo in Washington. But then, Trump is Trump: When he’s getting punched hard, as he is every day now, he’s going to punch back almost every time whether that’s smart or not. (He at least had the good sense not to take the Democrats’ bait by attacking Michelle Obama.) Maybe Wikileaks will bail him out with some nuclear Hillary oppo next week."
100632,1006,Stop complaining about Trump’s “war on the media” because he’s right,http://hotair.com/archives/2016/10/15/stop-complaining-trumps-war-media-hes-right/,23,"This morning I broke from my usual media consumption routine during my weekend shift of Hot Air work. Normally I leave the television tuned in to CNN’s New Day with Victor Blackwell and Christi Paul. After a couple of hours I shut it off. The reason was that there were really only two stories being covered over and over again. One was the imbroglio over the various women accusing Donald Trump of groping or kissing them and the other was the Wikileaks release of John Podesta’s emails. That’s probably a fair balance of two major campaign stories if we want to pretend that there’s no element of media bias at play, but one of them was being discussed for vast blocks of time while the other received a quick question for two guests to debate for a minute or so and then they cut to commercial.

Care to guess which story was which?

This got me thinking yet again about the recent claims that Donald Trump is engaged in some sort of war on the media. How horrible! The man is clearly trying to undermine our democracy. This theme jumps out at me in every batch of headlines I crack open these days. For examples, look no further than the story which our own Larry O’Connor broke open earlier this week about DNC Chair Donna Brazile feeding debate questions to Hillary Clinton. Larry interviewed Jake Tapper about it and he described it as journalistically horrifying.

How much do you know about that story? If you get all of your campaign information from cable news I’m guessing the answer is not much. In fact, while it may have happened briefly, I haven’t personally seen it so much as mentioned on CNN over the past few days. There’s been the odd coverage of some of the other emails, but not this story. By contrast, I now know virtually every detail of the Trump accusations, down to the level of what sorts of clothing the women were wearing, their seating arrangements on planes or in clubs and the names of their mothers and sisters who they complained to.

Still, the media largely finds any criticism of the balance in their coverage to be a cause for further attacking Trump rather than an examination of their own practices. Paul Farhi at the Washington Post complains, The press always got booed at Trump rallies. But now the aggression is menacing. Paul Waldman went further, declaring that Trump’s “war on the media” has failed.

But now, it’s important for Republicans to understand this critical fact about Trump’s outright declaration of war against the media: It’s failing. It hasn’t intimidate reporters into giving him the adulatory coverage he wanted; in fact, if anything it has encouraged them to investigate him as thoroughly as possible and describe him accurately as the uniquely disturbing and threatening candidate he is.
Joe Concha, writing at The Hill, put the media’s coverage of the campaign in perspective when he compared the network news air time allotted to accusations made by several women against Trump versus the amount of time they spend talking about the Clinton related Wikileaks revelations. And I’m asking you to really pay attention to this short snippet even though it involves some math. (Emphasis added)

In viewing recordings by The Hill of each of the major network news evening newscasts, which are watched by an average 22-24 million viewers each night collectively, the newest batch of Wikileaks revelations — which include derogatory comments of Catholics by senior Clinton campaign officials and more disturbing examples of collusion between the media and said campaign (See: newsworthy stuff) — was covered for a combined 57 seconds out of 66 minutes of total air time on ABC, NBC and CBS.

In a related story, allegations by four women against Donald Trump accusing him of unwanted sexual advances was covered a combined 23 minutes.

Add it all up, and one presidential candidate’s negative news of the day was somehow covered more than 23 times more than another candidate’s negative news of the day.
Keep in mind here that this is the ratio of coverage for all of the various Wikileaks stories about Clinton. The mentions of the specific collusion between TV One co-host Roland Martin, Donna Brazile and Clinton campaign was only a tiny fraction of that. But isn’t this, at least in some ways, the most shocking story of all to emerge from the dusty vaults of John Podesta’s G-mail account? We’re talking about a story where the media isn’t just providing unbalanced coverage, but actually aiding and abetting the Clinton campaign in a presidential debate. If we have evidence of even one instance of this going on, why would anyone already distrustful of the media bias landscape choose to believe the protests coming from cable news talking heads?

So where is CNN’s coverage of this critical story? To their minor credit, while it’s not being discussed on the air, their website does at least hold a single article on this debacle from Brian Stelter. (Though to find it you need to do a search on the key phrase “Donna Brazile” and then scroll down past her bio, her CNN profile, some complaints about Ted Cruz from June of this year and several articles from the Democrats’ convention in Philadelphia before finding this piece which was published on Tuesday.)

In it, he concludes that there almost certainly was a leak to Brazile and she absolutely sent at least one question to the Clinton campaign. (She’s refusing to answer the charge directly, of course.) And we should be clear here that it was text taken from Roland Martin’s question. None of Jake Tapper’s questions showed up in the emails. But still, this should be one of the biggest stories of the campaign, and yet you barely hear a peep about it.

Is Donald Trump engaging in a “war on the media” this year? I suppose so. But they certainly seem to be asking for it."

Trump announced on Twitter this morning that he would be talking about the drug problem in New Hampshire and around the country:Trump did talk about the drug problem but also suggested Hillary might be using something. “She’s getting pumped,” Trump said, adding, “You understand.” “In fact we’re going to be talking about that in a few minutes,” he continued.

Trump then compared himself and Clinton to athletes saying, “We’re like athletes, right? Look, I beat 17 senators, governors— I beat all these people.” “Hillary beat Bernie although it looked like Bernie got a little bit of a bad deal based on wikileaks, right?” he continued.

“But we’re like athletes, right? So athletes they’re making them more and more…athletes, they take a drug test. I think that we should take a drug test prior to the debate,” Trump suggested. “Why don’t we do that? We should take a drug test prior ’cause I don’t know what’s going on with her,” he continued adding, “at the beginning of her last debate she was all pumped up at the beginning and at the end it was like, ugh, take me down.”

This is the same way Trump brought up the accusations about Ted Cruz’s father hanging out with Lee Harvey Oswald (based on a National Enquirer story). Is there an Enquirer story to hang this one on? Here’s the video. "

This one in particular says a lot about Hillary’s character.

Grandma admits the current political system is designed to protect incumbents, and that she wants to rework rules in the Senate in order to undercut opposition to Democrats.

That’s not all.

She said incumbents do not have “the full interests of the people.”

Fantastic. From Breitbart:

Well, look, I—I think that everyone agrees that we’re in a bad patch in our political system and in Washington. It’s—you know, there’s a lot of good things happening elsewhere in the country. There are a lot of mayors, you had Mitch Landrieu here, I was with Rahm Emanuel yesterday. There’s a lot of innovative, interesting, new ideas being put into practice by mayors, by some governors. So I think when we talk about our political system, we’re really focusing more on what’s happening in Washington. And it is dysfunctional right now. And it is for a variety of reasons, some of them systemic, as you suggested. You know, I really have come to believe that we need to change the rules in the Senate, having served there for eight years. It’s only gotten more difficult to do anything. And I think nominees deserve a vote up or down. Policies deserve a vote up or down. And I don’t think that a small handful of senators should stand in the way of that, because, you know, a lot of those senators are really obstructionist. They should get out. They should make their case. They should go ahead and debate. But they shouldn’t be able to stop the action of the United States Senate. So I think there does have to be some reworking of the rules, particularly in the Senate. I think that, as has been discussed many times, the partisan drawing of lines in Congressional districts gives people — gives incumbents certainly a lot more protection than an election should offer. And then they’re only concerned about getting a challenge from the left of the Democratic Party or a challenge from the right in the Republican Party. And they’re not representing really the full interests of the people in the area that they’re supposed to be.

California moved toward this non-partisan board, and I think there should be more efforts in states to do that and get out of the ridiculous gerrymandering that has given us so many members who don’t really care what is happening in the country, don’t really care what the facts are. They just care whether they get a primary opponent.

And then it comes down to who we vote for and what kind of expectations we set and who we give money to. Those who help to fund elections, I think it’s important that business leaders make it clear, why would you give money to somebody who was willing to wreck the full faith and credit of the United States. I mean, that just makes no sense at all because the economic repercussions would have been very bad, and the long-term consequences with, you know, the Chinese saying, let’s de-Americanize the world and eventually move to a different reserve currency wouldn’t be, you know, beneficial, either. So I think there are steps that citizens have to take. It’s not just about how we rearrange the levers of power and the institutions in Washington.

How about no to everything Hillary Clinton wants for America?

Yeah, that’ll work.

We need to rid ourselves of the Clinton disease once and for all.

Enough is enough."

Barack Obama wants to impose a test for media organizations, meaning, he wants to silence conservative outlets.

Get where I’m going here?

If Hillary wins, say goodbye to conservative voices.

From Breitbart:

President Barack Obama floated the notion of a test for media organizations, griping about the wide-spread existence of alternative media available in America. He was critical of the current Wild West online environment where people could say anything on social media or on news websites.

“We are going to have to rebuild within this wild-wild-west-of-information flow some sort of curating function that people agree to,” he said. Throughout his presidency, Obama has repeatedly complained about the existence of Fox News and Rush Limbaugh, causing division amongst Americans and making his job difficult, but he rarely offers a solution.

This time, Obama floated the notion of a media test during at a speech at Carnegie Mellon University in Pittsburgh on Thursday. It’s not just conservative voices that will vanish, it will also be the Second, Fourth, and Fifth Amendments.

So, even if you’re not a fan of Donald Trump, remember what’s at stake.

Think of the Supreme Court, which will be priority number one for the next prez.

It’s now being reported that a State Dept. official and FBI agents discussed reclassifying Hillary’s emails in exchange for jobs overseas.

Or, quid pro quo.

Or, pay for play – in a sense.

More… From Fox News:

FBI interview summaries and notes, provided late Friday to the House Government Oversight and Intelligence Committees, contain allegations of a “quid pro quo” between a senior State Department executive and FBI agents during the Hillary Clinton email investigation, two congressional sources told Fox News. “This is a flashing red light of potential criminality,” Republican Rep. Jason Chaffetz of Utah, who has been briefed on the FBI interviews, told Fox News.

He said “there was an alleged quid pro quo” involving Undersecretary for Management Patrick Kennedy and the FBI “over at least one classified email.” “In return for altering the classification, the possibility of additional slots for the FBI at missions overseas was discussed,” Chaffetz said.

As Fox News previously reported, interviews released earlier this month, known as 302s, reveal the serious allegation that Kennedy applied pressure to subordinates to change classified email codes so they would be shielded from Congress and the public. Fox News was told as far back as August 2015 that Kennedy was running interference on Capitol Hill. But Kennedy, in his FBI interview on Dec. 21, 2015, “categorically rejected” allegations of classified code tampering. Because none of us lost faith in the State Dept. or the FBI before this news, right?

100637,1008,It's Not an Election. It's a War.,http://www.americanthinker.com/articles/2016/10/its_not_an_election_its_a_war.html,23,"There are an awful lot of people out there who still think this is a conventional election, that we are choosing between two candidates on the basis of experience, policies, and character.

This is not a conventional election.  This is, as the late, great Andrew Breitbart put it, ""war!""

An all-out culture war.

It's not a war that conservatives started or have ever wanted.  It is a war that has been thrust on us.  But if we don't treat it as a war, if we don't take it seriously as a war, we will lose and lose miserably.  We will lose not just for the next four years, but for the next 40 years, and possibly the next 400 years.

In other words, this is not a skirmish or a tiny battle, as the #NeverTrump crowd imagines.  If we don't defeat the enemy in November, there may not be another chance for a long time to come.

When you're at war, your tactics change considerably.  For your leader, you don't want a gentleman warrior or an intellectual who is good at articulating ideas but not very good in the trenches.  Those are peacetime leaders, perhaps, but not wartime generals.   

At time of war, you pick a general who is tough as nails and will lead you confidently into battle and be victorious.  You choose someone who knows how important it is, as Winston Churchill said, to ""Never give up!  Never give up!  Never, never, never-never-never-never!""  

The general you pick may be foul-mouthed, crude, or brusque.  He may have any number of personal failings.  Those things don't matter in war.  What matters is:

Is he on your side?

Is he a fighter?

Can he rally the troops?

Can he weaken the opponent?

Can he administer death blows when needed?

Can he emerge victorious?

In short, you need someone who is strong, fierce, and not easily taken down.  Ironically, the Republican symbol of the elephant is the perfect metaphor – a creature who, on the one hand, is often seen as big, clumsy, and lovable, but who turns out to be of the most dangerous animals on Earth.  A creature who has been known to be vindictive and can trample even a rhinoceros – so a donkey shouldn't be that hard.

Is this Donald J. Trump?

Absolutely.  He has shown that no matter what dirt gets dug up and thrown at him, he will not back down.  He is the first Republican candidate to come along in more than 25 years who isn't afraid to battle the Democrats – and the media – with the same firepower they bring into battle.

Scott Adams, the creator of the cartoon Dilbert, has written extensively on the ""persuasion"" elements of this election and says that Trump's temperament is predictable, that ""when Trump counter-attacks, he always responds with equal measure. Words are met with words and scandal mentions are met with scandal mentions. (And maybe a few words.) But always proportionate and immediate.""

So what we are seeing, and what we may see for the remainder of the campaign, is Trump responding in full force to the media and the left-wing onslaught.

In short, he's bringing out the big guns.

But he's bringing out the big guns because that's what the other side already has aimed at him.

Consider the 2005 video of Trump's lewd comments.  The Democrat-controlled media thought they could take Donald Trump down and end his candidacy for good by airing the video two days before the second presidential debate.  But, unlike almost every other Republican you can name, Trump didn't back down.  He came out swinging.

Debate moderator Anderson Cooper called Trump's 2005 comments ""sexual assault,"" and said, ""You bragged that you have sexually assaulted women.  Do you understand that?""

Trump corrected him and subtly undercut the claim: ""No, I didn't say that at all.  I don't think you understood what was said.  This was locker room talk.""  He then apologized to his family and the American public and masterfully switched the subject:

You know, when we have a world when you have ISIS chopping off heads and frankly drowning people in steel cages, where you have so many bad things happening … we should get onto much more important things and much bigger things.

The moderators and the Democrats were stunned that their many shots at Trump did not succeed.  He outgunned them at every turn.  When he said Hillary should be in jail, they were reeling.  No one has ever gone after Hillary the way Trump has.  

Now, having failed round one, the left has brought out even bigger guns – women who claim that Trump groped them and sexually assaulted them on numerous occasions going back to the 1980s.

But once again, Trump will not be taken down easily.  At a speech in West Palm Beach, Florida, he went on offense almost immediately.

""These people are horrible people.  They're horrible, horrible liars,"" he said of the women accusing him.  ""And interestingly, it happens to appear 26 days before our very important election.""

He challenged the account of one woman, Jessica Leeds, who claims that Trump touched her on a first-class flight to New York more than 30 years ago and was ""like an octopus.""  

Trump's response:  ""Another ridiculous tale.  No witnesses.  No nothing.""

He cast aspersion on People magazine reporter Natasha Stoynoff, who claimed that Trump forced her against a wall and tried to kiss her in 2005, when she was interviewing Trump and his wife, Melania, in 2005.  Donald Trump pointed out the ""area was a public area – people all over the place.""

But the media is again trying to slay the elephant.  For example, CNN senior media correspondent Brian Stelter immediately jumped into the fray, calling Trump's speech ""paranoid"" and ""dangerous.""

This is war, ladies and gentlemen.  It's not a conventional election, and it's not a gentlemen's disagreement or a skirmish or a fistfight.  You can't sit at home with popcorn and enjoy the show, because eventually the lights will come up, and we will be saddled with either Hillary Clinton or Donald Trump for four years.

If it's Hillary, then you can gird yourself for what will surely be daily battles over guns, free speech, Supreme Court nominees, higher taxes, more immigration, more years of a bad economy, and a multitude of other bad decisions.

Or you can take your chances with the elephant, Donald J. Trump.

Whose side on you on?

100638,1008,Public Education: Progressivism's Unbeatable Advantage,http://www.americanthinker.com/articles/2016/10/public_education_progressivisms_unbeatable_advantage.html,23,"(The following is adapted from the introduction to the author's new book, The Case Against Public Education. More information below.)

During an 1839 debate in Britain's House of Commons regarding the establishment of government schools, the young Benjamin Disraeli objected:

Wherever is found what is called paternal government, there is found state education. It has been discovered that the best way to insure implicit obedience is to commence tyranny in the nursery.

Though Disraeli's pithy remark may seem startling in our age of universal public schooling, in fact he was merely stating the obvious. Government-controlled schooling, in all its variations, is essentially a tool of paternalism, i.e., of the tyrannical impulse. Such schooling was conceived and developed with a compliant and uniform citizenry, rather than an educated one, as its primary goal. Our civilization's moral and intellectual decline is primarily the product of the world’s two-hundred-year experiment in state child-rearing. It is time to face this reality squarely.

Education is nothing less than civilization itself considered from the developmental point of view. It is the process of becoming civilized, which for centuries of so-called Western humanity was grounded in variations on a few related themes: The rational individual, a natural microcosm who is therefore capable in principle of understanding his immediate surroundings within a comprehensive view of the whole, must live by his own will, which requires cultivating practical knowledge, intellectual self-reliance, and moral independence. To undermine self-reliance, to deny independence, and to diminish or curtail the desire for knowledge, is thus to denature men, in the sense of turning us against ourselves. And that is what modern public schooling was and is designed to accomplish.

We are living through the final stages of progressivism’s two-hundred-year ascendancy. The expansion of practical liberty and material prosperity in the nineteenth century was rooted in the ideas and sensibilities of the preceding centuries. Already in the early 1800s, however, seeds of modernity’s invasive weed had germinated, and were sending up shoots throughout the West. Progressivism, the idea that History itself is a kind of animate being seeking its goal in a deified Future, and hence that humanity, History’s chariot, is essentially a collective entity with a collective purpose, was an impossible fit in a civilization supported by the intellectual pillars of rational self-discovery, individual sovereignty, and the moral and metaphysical primacy of the personal soul -- ""life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness,"" as Thomas Jefferson, adapting Locke, so deftly crystallized our nature.

Initially, this anti-modern, anti-rational, and anti-individual philosophy exerted its most profound effects primarily in its native soil, Germany, although it was gradually invading Western academia and the arts. The practical problem for the original progressives, the German idealists, was that the pursuit of happiness, which is to say of private knowledge, private virtue, and a private glimpse of eternity, seemed to answer to a basic human impulse, or at least one basic to the Western tradition. There could therefore be no hope of realizing their new religion of the progress of collective humanity, i.e., History, short of a radical separation of mankind from the social conditions that both derived from and fostered the older moral perspective which they despised.

This radical separation would require the strategic application of coercive authority to snap nature’s thread linking men’s hearts to their own lives, their own needs, and their own futures. As such a strategy, pursued against adults, would immediately be identified and resisted as a form of enslavement, its proper targets would have to be children. It would have to displace the private family as the locus of authority and emotional dependency in the children’s formative years. And it would have to exploit the children’s natural desires, fears, and pleasures to break them to the will of the collective, which means the will of the state.

German thought had been edging toward a systematic rejection of the traditional understanding of human nature for some years before anyone had manifested the combination of profound intellect and profound megalomania needed to conceive of an effective way of bringing these radical ideas down from the ivory tower, and into the practical life of a nation. The man who finally rose to the occasion was one of the four great figures of German idealism, Hegel's precursor, Johann Gottlieb Fichte. In Addresses to the German Nation (1808), he explains his vision of compulsory, government-controlled schooling, designed explicitly to subvert and undo the entire rational and religious heritage of the West in favor of a neo-mysticism with its own new trinity -- the future, the state, and the collective. This was both progressivism’s first comprehensive mission statement and the blueprint for what in the twentieth century came to be known as re-education camps.

It was this bold new idea that the West’s leading education reformers, from France and Britain to America and Canada, flocked to Prussia to study and to adapt for application at home. Though facing great resistance in nations with traditions of freedom, in the end, by persistence, obfuscation, and stealth, these admirers of Fichte’s blueprint won the day throughout the civilized world. Compulsory schooling found its voice over the nineteenth century, its chorus joined by statesmen, bureaucrats, business titans, and academics -- anyone desirous of coercively entrenching a social status quo with himself in an elite position; anyone swept up in the early waves of progressive theory or activism, whether of the idealist-mystical or the materialist-socialist sort; and, in principle, simply anyone with the instinct to impose where he is unable to persuade.

As a result of this progressive educational insurgency, compulsory schooling, tyranny commenced in the nursery, gradually became the norm throughout the advanced world -- a world, we would do well to recall, that had become advanced without such schooling. The schools may not yet have been all that a progressive could hope for, but the ratchet mechanism of ever-expanding government control within the private spiritual realm, i.e., the mind, had been set in irreversible motion. The most vital, or rather fatal, step, namely state compulsion itself, had been taken.

And what is compulsory or ""universal"" schooling, in a nutshell? It is the legally enforced diluting of parental authority over the raising of children, with intellectual and moral lessons, goals, and methods regulated by the government. It is usually undertaken in government buildings away from the family home, and under the supervision of various levels of government agents trained in accordance with government standards to represent and administer government policy regarding the proper rank-ordering of society, the attitudes and skills deemed by the government to be most socially useful, and the pre-emptive extinguishing or subduing of beliefs, attitudes, and behavior judged to be undesirable to the government for any reason. It weakens the natural attachments to family and familial associations in favor of cultivating alternative attachments to government officers, and to the artificial, government-designed social order of the school. Broadly, it encourages feelings of submissiveness to, and dependence upon, the opinions and judgments of an abstract collective, thus effectively discouraging independent thought, thwarting the development of self-reliance, and in general ensuring that no one ever actualizes his full intellectual and practical potential.

At this point, no doubt, progressive readers are rising to object that the preceding description completely misrepresents the purpose and value of public education, while many conservatives, I imagine, may be ready to accuse me of weakening my case with hyperbole. To those critics, or to those among them prepared to engage honestly with this subject matter, I issue a friendly challenge: Go back and reread the offending paragraph, this time without the presuppositions we have all had drilled into us about the supposed necessity of public schools. Find in that paragraph one sentence, one phrase, one adjective that may properly be said to exaggerate anything, or indeed to say anything at all apart from a simple matter-of-fact description of public school.

Furthermore, I ask you to find one statement or description in that paragraph that has not also been offered, in similar words, in defense of public education, by any number of the institution’s most influential advocates, from Fichte to Horace Mann to John Dewey to Mao Tse-tung on down. Admittedly, you will find that most of the public school proponents who spoke this honestly about their methods and intentions were men of the nineteenth and early twentieth centuries, before progressivism, as part of its assault on the final pockets of civilized resistance, invented the dainty linguistic duplicity that we call political correctness.

Consider, again, the last part of Disraeli’s critique of government schooling: ""It has been discovered that the best way to insure implicit obedience is to commence tyranny in the nursery."" I draw your attention to the main verb, ""discovered."" Disraeli’s important observation is that the superlative value of state education as a tool of tyranny is a discovery that tyrannical men have made. That is, men with a desire for illegitimate power will find their way to this most ingenious and effective method of control if it is made accessible to them.

All that has changed since the young Disraeli and others made their cautionary stands is that we have now witnessed the full poisonous fruit of the subversion they foresaw. Public education now exerts universal social control to a degree that might have seemed unthinkable to its early critics. By retarding spiritual growth in the name of entrenching state compliance and dependency as inescapable norms, progressivism has added a final twist to Disraeli’s ironic stab. For he warned of ""tyranny in the nursery,"" whereas today’s educational establishments have taken this one step further, seeking, by means of the maturation-stunting effects of public school, to establish nothing less than tyranny as a nursery.

In short, the susceptibility of government schools to exploitation as tools of oppressive social manipulation -- the Prussian model in a nutshell -- was once understood by many to be a risk too great to be borne. Today it is a reality too manifest to be denied. The promise of modernity -- the promise of liberty and a civil order grounded in practical reason and virtue -- remains now only as a dim shadow of its true self, maintained merely to pacify the masses with a chimerical representation of freedom and morality in place of the real things.

If there is to be a renewal of our morally and politically exhausted civilization in the foreseeable future, it will of necessity begin with an educational emancipation. The effort is already long overdue.

100639,1008,Hillary’s Waco Deception,http://www.americanthinker.com/articles/2016/10/hillarys_waco_deception_.html,23,"Before Benghazi, before the e-mail scandal, before the numerous allegations of impropriety involving the Clinton Foundation, there was Waco.  On April 19, 1993, a few short months into Bill Clinton’s first presidential term, nearly 80 men, women, and children perished at Mt. Carmel, their religious community and home near Waco, Texas.  A Federal investigation into the tragedy in 2000 found that government agents were not responsible for the deaths of Davidian civilians — that the sect members who died there had committed mass suicide, similar to the Kool-Aid drinking by Jim Jones’ aficionados, but more violent.  This verdict was significant, given the allegations by Davidian survivors and relatives that sect members had been shot as they tried to flee their burning buildings.  And while many laid blame for the outcome at the feet of then-Attorney General Janet Reno, there are claims that Hillary Clinton was actually the one in charge .

Allegations of gunfire were based on more than Davidian survivors’ testimony.  They were based, also, on interpretations of imagery collected by an infrared camera on a fixed-wing aircraft that circled Mt. Carmel in the hours surrounding the fire.  Bright, repetitive flashes were thought, by some infrared experts, to constitute evidence of weapons fire from outside the buildings in which the Davidians were pinned.  While this circumstance encouraged the question, “Did the FBI shoot at civilians?” -- its Hostage Rescue Team had managed a 51-day standoff prior to the fiery climax -- members of the U. S. Army’s Delta Force and the elite British SAS were also present on site.

The 2000 investigation, headed by former Republican Senator John Danforth and costing the U. S. taxpayer about $17 M, was concurrent with a wrongful death lawsuit brought by Davidian survivors and relatives against the FBI.  Government experts contended that the flashes’ most likely cause was sun reflections off debris in the Mt. Carmel courtyard: the infrared camera, they said, would have been unlikely to register muzzle flash as bright and long-lasting as the flashes seen on Mt. Carmel’s video.  As experts waged thermal warfare in affidavits and in the press, other investigators researched the basics of infrared gunfire signatures.

To the general public, this talk of an unfamiliar technology sounded very confusing; and the government, which had nearly exclusively developed it, made no attempt to educate them. In fact, the Federal judge presiding over the civil trial decided against gunfire based on his reading of the affidavits, depriving a jury of the opportunity to hear the evidence directly from those who’d studied the problem.  In doing so, he negated the one and only chance members of the public might have had to weigh in on the issue before an official judgment was rendered.

Might official verdicts have been different if the public had known something about infrared technology while the controversy flared?  For instance, what if it had been known that a thermal infrared image, captured at wavelengths longer than the eye can see, allows objects to be discerned not only when they are of sufficient size, but are also of sufficient brightness relative to their background, as this clip from the Waco video demonstrates?

If the public had been able to see demonstrations like this one, then perhaps a key government claim — that persons must be seen near the flashes in order to conclude gunfire — would have been easily dismissed, if not laughed off.  No shooters equals no shots — while sounding very reasonable to those familiar only with visible light imagery — became instead a clever tool in the government’s deception arsenal.  

A Now-Defunct Government Lab’s Shadowy Role in Danforth’s Waco investigation

Given that nearly all U.S. infrared technology since WW II had been developed by the US Government, it should not have been surprising that the majority of infrared practitioners, even in 2000, owed their livelihoods to it.  As a result, infrared experts willing to go on record with their opinions of the Waco tapes were difficult to find.  Tucson attorney David Hardy wrote of retired engineers who’d believed Waco’s flashes were gunfire, but did not wish to become involved in a trial[1].  An infrared inspection firm whose analyst had claimed gunfire on 60 Minutes years before declined further involvement due to the possibility of negative business repercussions[2].  The Davidians’ primary expert in their civil lawsuit, retired Army scientist Dr. Edward Allard, suffered a disabling stroke just weeks before the investigation’s field tests were run.  Another expert, Carlos Ghigliotti, had given Hardy a data dump of his results concluding gunfire and told this author that the Waco situation would be resolved soon, when he called a press conference.  Unfortunately, that call was never made: Carlos was found dead in his home in late April, of an apparent heart attack at age 42.

The infrared test was conducted at Ft. Hood, Texas, the place later made notorious by the killing spree of Nidal Malik Hasan.  Erroneously referred to in press reports as a “re-creation” of conditions on the standoff’s last day, its conditions and those under which the Davidians perished could not have been more different.  The test’s errors, omissions, and obfuscations were so egregious that they could not have been anything other than deliberate — particularly given the high caliber of the so-called “neutral experts” selected as test conductors. 

Those experts — and experts, they were — came from ERIM, the Environmental Research Institute of Michigan, up until 2001 the sanctum sanctorum of U. S. infrared technology.  They, literally, wrote the book on infrared.

Some of the anomalies: the Ft. Hood test featured an infrared camera collecting data at U. K. rates of 25 frames per second, mounted on a helicopter.  The Waco imager of 1993 collected data at U. S. rates, 30 frames per second, and was mounted on a fixed-wing aircraft.  In any reasonable test, the choice of sensor frame rate and platform should match the original — which did not happen at Ft. Hood.  Moreover, the slower frame rate of the 2000 test camera worked against imaging a fast-moving phenomenon — infrared muzzle flash — for as long as it might appear on the original Mt. Carmel video.  As flash duration was a critical element in the controversy, the choice of a camera with a slower frame rate worked against reasonable comparison, making gunfire muzzle flash a less likely conclusion from the test.

Other factors worked to decrease the brightness and duration of muzzle flash captured on the 2000 test camera, making it appear as though gunfire could not have caused the bright Waco flashes in 1993.  These included the field’s lack of atmospheric particulate (dust -- which works to produce a bright secondary combustion effect from muzzle exhaust gases) and an earth background so bright that muzzle flash would scarcely be seen against it (Davidian expert Ferdinand Zegel believed that the test camera’s infrared detector had malfunctioned to create this effect.)

These were just a few of the obvious errors and omissions.  Several others were identified including the fact that a weapons-ammunition combination at Waco which had been shown to produce bright flashes was not tested at Ft. Hood.

I’d consulted more than one ERIM-associated expert in my attempts to better understand the phenomena and bring wider expertise to bear on the problem — something I believed a nationally-prominent scientist should have been doing, but wasn’t.  As I shared more information with my contacts, including results of muzzle flash tests I’d conducted with attorney David Hardy, the e-mails stopped returning and my phone calls went unanswered.  One colleague even told me he’d been advised to “cool it” regarding his study of Waco’s technical issues; and he suggested I do the same.

“Cool it.”  Why?  Well, since my colleague was a university professor, perhaps the university (my alma mater, too, The University of Arizona College of Optical Sciences) worried about continued funding — not only in infrared technology, but in any major technology related to optics, also.  It just wouldn’t do to accuse one’s major customer — the U. S. government — of murdering civilians within its borders.

I declined to “cool it” and offered my own conclusion about the flashes on the Waco FLIR in late 2001: that they were likely to have come from government gunfire.  In the years since, as I’ve studied the problem, it is more apparent to me than ever that the government shot and killed civilians at Waco on April 19, 1993.

And those experts in the 2000 Ft. Hood tests, from ERIM, who were so good that they absolutely knew what they were doing, but produced an unscientific comparison, anyway?   I’m not certain what happened to them, individually, but in 2001, ERIM ceased to exist as a separate entity.  “ERIM acquired Vector Research, Inc. (VRI) in 2001 to form the Altarum Institute4] headquartered in Ann Arbor, Michigan.”  Given that Vector Research had been a part of Anteon — the parent company of Danforth’s Special Counsel experts, Vector Data Systems, that association is significant.  How neutral was ERIM — a so-called “neutral expert” — to begin with? 

These are critical questions that deserve careful examination by a highly skilled investigator.  Unfortunately, Michael McNulty passed away in 2015 so he is unable to continue this work.  This is not only a good time to review events surrounding the Waco controversy: it is the optimum time, given the responsibility of the individual who called the final shots at Waco — Democratic Presidential candidate Hillary Clinton.

100640,1009,CLINTON OPERATIVES BRAG THEY “SCARED OFF” CHIEF JUSTICE,http://www.powerlineblog.com/archives/2016/10/clinton-operatives-brag-they-scared-off-chief-justice.php,23,"In one of the more remarkable Wikileaks exchanges, Clinton operatives Neera Tanden and Jennifer Palmieri took credit for “scaring off” Chief Justice John Roberts by threatening to make the Supreme Court’s decision in the first Obamacare case, NFIB v. Sebelius, a campaign issue. These are the players on the email thread:

Center for American Progress (CAP): a left-wing activist organization that was an arm of the Obama administration and now is an arm of the Clinton campaign.

Neera Tanden: President of CAP.

John Podesta: Former President of CAP, now Hillary Clinton’s campaign chairman.

Jennifer Palmieri: Former White House Communications Director for Barack Obama, now communications director for the Hillary Clinton campaign.

Jake Sullivan: Hillary Clinton’s deputy chief of staff when she was Secretary of State, now foreign policy adviser to the Clinton campaign.

In the main email in the thread, Neera Tanden harkens back to the first Obamacare case, decided on a 5-4 vote in 2012, and says that she believes the White House “scared off” Chief Justice John Roberts by politicizing the case. She suggests that the Clinton campaign should do the same with regard to the then-pending second Obamacare case, King v. Burwell. She identifies Justices Roberts and Anthony Kennedy as most vulnerable to political pressure:

I mentioned this to John some time back, but think it’s a bit more current now.

It is most likely that this decision has already been made by the Court, but on the off chance that history is repeating itself, then it’s possible they are still deciding (last time, seems like Roberts went from striking the mandate to supporting it in the weeks before). As Jennifer will remember, it was pretty critical that the President threw the gauntlet down last time on the Court, warning them in the first case that it would politicize the role of the Court for them to rule against the ACA. As a close reader of the case, I honestly believe that was vital to scaring Roberts off.

In this case, I’m not arguing that Hillary spend a lot of time attacking the Court. I do think it would be very helpful to all of our interest in a decision affirming the law, for Roberts and perhaps Kennedy to see negative political consequences to ruling against the government. Therefore, I think it would be helpful to have a story of how progressives and Hillary would make the Supreme Court an election issue (which would be a ready argument for liberals) if the Court rules against the government. It’s not that you wish that happens. But that would be the necessary consequence of a negative decision…the Court itself would become a hugely important political issue.

At CAP Action, we can get that story started. But kinda rests on you guys to make it stick.

What do you think? If you want to proceed, we should move soon.

Tanden then added this in a separate email:

And to clarify, the candidate wouldn’t have to do anything. I think we could move the story with just a nod from the campaign on the strategy.

Note how CAP seamlessly coordinates with the Clinton campaign, taking directions on whether to “move the story” from campaign officials. Tanden makes no pretense of independence.

Jake Sullivan responded that he is “into it,” but would “defer to Jen on this one.” Palmieri gave the green light:

She has already been making this an issue. Not sure how in depth you are suggesting but seems like this should be manageable.

Of course, the liberals’ belief that Justices Roberts and Kennedy can be influenced by political pressure, and that such pressure was “pretty critical” to the decision upholding Obamacare’s constitutionality, could be wrong. Their conversation is, in any event, chilling."
100641,1009,THE AP CAMPAIGNS FOR HILLARY,http://www.powerlineblog.com/archives/2016/10/the-ap-campaigns-for-hillary.php,23,"We wrote here and here about how Associated Press reporter Jill Colvin has made herself and her “news” agency spokesmen for the Hillary Clinton campaign. Today Ms. Colvin outdid herself in reporting on Donald Trump’s speech in Portsmouth, New Hampshire. She begins:

A beleaguered Donald Trump sought to undermine the legitimacy of the U.S. presidential election on Saturday, pressing unsubstantiated claims the contest is rigged against him, vowing anew to jail Hillary Clinton if he’s elected and throwing in a wild, baseless insinuation his rival was on drugs in the last debate.

Seriously? Did the Clinton campaign write that paragraph, or did Colvin come up with it on her own?

Not even the country’s more than two centuries of peaceful transitions of political leadership were sacrosanct as Trump accused the media and the Clinton campaign of conspiring against him to undermine a free and fair election.

I’m not sure what the reference to “two centuries of peaceful transitions of political leadership” is supposed to mean. Is she insinuating the Trump is plotting a coup? Or grumbling that he isn’t accepting defeat passively like a good Republican?

In a country with a history of peaceful political transition, his challenge to the election’s legitimacy — as a way to explain a loss in November, should that happen — was a striking rupture of faith in American democracy.

Well, it represents as lack of faith in the liberal press, anyway. This is what Trump said, as quoted by Colvin herself:

“The election is being rigged by corrupt media pushing completely false allegations and outright lies in an effort to elect her president,” he said, referring to the several women who have come forward in recent days to say that Trump had groped or sexually assaulted them.

I don’t think there is any doubt about the fact that the media, including the Associated Press, have pushed the allegations against Trump in an effort to elect Hillary Clinton. Does that make the media “corrupt,” as Trump says, or is electing Hillary part of a journalist’s job, as the New York Times now proudly proclaims? That is a matter of opinion, but I think Trump’s characterization is fair.

Finally, Ms. Colvin counters Trump’s suggestion that Mrs. Clinton may be taking drugs prior to the presidential debates. She apparently thinks Trump was being serious:

Trump also suggested at one point Saturday that Clinton had been on drugs during the last debate. Instead of spending the weekend preparing, he said, “I think she’s actually getting pumped up, you want to know the truth.”

“I think we should take a drug test prior to the debate, ’cause I don’t know what’s going on with her,” he said.

Trump offered no evidence to support the bizarre claim, which he appeared to base on his belief Clinton was energetic at the start of their second debate and downbeat at its conclusion. Nothing about Clinton’s demeanor in the debate suggested she was anything but clean and sober.

Ms. Colvin doesn’t seem to grasp the irony: Trump says the election is rigged because a corrupt media establishment is trying to elect Hillary Clinton, and with her own reporting, Colvin demonstrates that he is right."
100642,1009,"GOLDMAN SACHS, THE DEMOCRATS’ FRIEND",http://www.powerlineblog.com/archives/2016/10/goldman-sachs-the-democrats-friend.php,23,"Wikileaks has released transcripts of three speeches that Hillary Clinton gave for Goldman Sachs in 2013. These were events hosted by Goldman, presumably for clients–e.g., the “Builders and Innovators Summit.” You can download the transcripts here. Hillary reportedly was paid $225,000 apiece.

Some have found the speeches of great interest; ZeroHedge flags some relatively significant passages. My own opinion is that the speeches do not contain much of interest, and virtually nothing, except as noted below, that is surprising.

Two things struck me about the Goldman speeches. The first is how utterly pedestrian they are. By 2013, Mrs. Clinton had served eight years in the Senate and four as Secretary of State, yet she never has an original observation or an insight worth paying for. Everything in them, you have heard 50 times before. They could have been delivered by anyone who has never held public office, but who spends Sunday mornings studying the New York Times. Maybe Hillary saves the good stuff for customers who pay her the full $300,000, but I doubt it. I think her speeches reflect her limited ability.

The second notable aspect of the speeches is how partisan they are. They were delivered in the wake of the government “shutdown,” and Hillary missed no opportunity to castigate Republicans for their “extremism.” She occasionally says that Washington dysfunction is the fault of both parties–their right and left wings, respectively–but 100% of her examples are Republicans. Her repeated jabs at Republicans would have been inappropriate before a bipartisan audience.

She even peddled the absurd claim that Congress’s temporary refusal to raise the debt ceiling represented a threat that the government would default on its bond obligations. Constitutionally, that can’t happen. Other payments might not have been made, but without any increase in the debt ceiling, government revenues were far more than needed to service the national debt. There was zero chance of a default, legally or financially.

The Goldman Sachs employees who were present must have known that Hillary was spinning a fantasy. It is their business, after all, to understand the security of debt obligations. Yet they cheerfully endorsed her spouting a Democratic Party line that was aimed at gullible voters, not sophisticated investors. I infer from this that Goldman’s massive contributions to Barack Obama, Hillary Clinton and other Democrats are not just donations of convenience. Rather, Goldman is a committed member of the Democratic Party coalition.

I suppose that makes sense. The Left is all about cronyism, and Goldman Sachs is the ultimate crony.

100643,1010,Sheriff openly calls for riots as Trump says election is ‘rigged’,https://thinkprogress.org/sheriff-openly-calls-for-riots-as-trump-says-election-is-rigged-dfe1a7ffc2b#.7ou0wlt31,23,"As Election Day approaches and the polls continue to look dire for Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump, he is pinning the blame on everything except himself. “We’re going to beat the rigged system; we’re going to beat the rigged election,” Trump said at a rally in New Hampshire on Saturday.
Sen. Jeff Sessions (R-AL) also told the crowd that “they are attempting to rig this election.”
Trump’s supporters are taking his “rigged” system rhetoric and accusations of lying by the media to their implied conclusion: revolt. Most of the grumblings and musings of rebellion have come from everyday Trump voters, but on Saturday, Trump surrogate and Milwaukee Sheriff David A. Clarke, an elected law official, tweeted that it’s “pitchforks and torches time” with a (stock) photo of an angry mob. Trump’s campaign is currently floundering under the weight of numerous new allegations by women accusing Trump of sexual assault and harassment. In response, Trump has smeared the women, threatened to sue the media, and promoted conspiracy theories about the election being rigged against him by the media, the government, and the political establishment. Trump has made similar allegations before, encouraging his supporters to watch the polls on election day to “make sure it’s on the up and up.” His comments seemed specifically aimed at sending his (overwhelmingly white) supporters to “watch” polls in inner-city areas, which have a higher population of black and Hispanic Americans. Trump is actively recruiting poll watchers at rallies and on social media. Voting rights advocates have raised alarms that the kind of monitoring Trump is asking for is likely to make it more difficult for people of color and other disenfranchised populations to vote_—_which could actually have consequences for the democratic process.
As Sheriff Clarke’s tweet shows, the rigged election rhetoric could also have real consequences should Trump lose the election.
At a recent rally in Cincinnati, Trump supporters told a reporter for the Boston Globe that they intended to head to local polling stations and watch for illegal immigrants, and that they suspected Hillary Clinton’s campaign was stuffing ballot boxes. They also floated ideas of armed rebellion and assassination.
“If she’s in office, I hope we can start a coup. She should be in prison or shot. That’s how I feel about it,” Dan Bowman, a 50-year-old contractor, told the reporters of Clinton. “We’re going to have a revolution and take them out of office if that’s what it takes. There’s going to be a lot of bloodshed. But that’s what it’s going to take… I would do whatever I can for my country.”"
100644,1002,How the Election Is ‘Rigged’ — And How it is Not,http://www.breitbart.com/big-government/2016/10/16/election-rigged-not/,24,"Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump has aroused new controversy by declaring that the 2016 presidential election is “rigged.” On the one hand, that is both an irresponsible statement, and also a potentially self-destructive one. On the other hand, it may be true.
It is irresponsible to claim the election is “rigged” for the reason most of Trump’s media critics have suggested — namely, that by casting the result as illegitimate, Trump is ensuring it will be harder to unify the country afterwards.

Moreover, it is politically questionable to call an election “rigged” while it is still ongoing, because it suggests the candidate making that statement expects to lose. Alternatively, declaring an election “rigged” could be a way of motivating supporters to flock to the polls: that is how Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu mobilized support in 2015, when he warned that foreign-funded organizations were frantically busing Arab voters to the polls. (He later apologized — after he won, of course.)

As a factual matter, it is impossible to know whether the election result on November 8 will be “rigged” — that is, if it will be affected by ballot-stuffing, hacking, voter fraud, and so on. Past experience suggests that fraud does have an effect — just ask former Minnesota Sen. Norm Coleman how he lost to Al Franken in 2008 — but given the sheer variety of jurisdictions that run a typical presidential election, the nationwide effect of voter fraud may be much harder to measure, and probably small.

What we do know is that important parts of the election have, in fact, been “rigged,” both in the literal and figurative sense. The Democratic Party primary was certainly rigged against Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-VT), both openly and secretly: openly, in the sense that the Democrats’ undemocratic superdelegate system is designed to thwart insurgent candidacies; secretly, in that the Democratic National Committee and parts of the media were colluding with Hillary Clinton, as revealed by Wikileaks.

More broadly, the election has been “rigged” because of the brazen corruption of the nation’s system of law enforcement, such that Hillary Clinton evaded prosecution for mis-handling classified information and destroying government documents — acts that would have landed anyone else in prison. What occurred behind the scenes in 2012, when the IRS silenced conservative non-profit groups, has occurred in the open in 2016: the partisan abuse of the state apparatus of law enforcement (and intelligence, if the reports of “Russian” hacking are unfounded).

Were the United States a third-world country, international monitors would report the FBI’s sham investigation and the Justice Department’s cozy arrangement with the Clinton family as signs that the election that followed would be neither free nor fair.

Republican voters, at least, feel that the election is being “rigged” in the sense that the media are hell-bent on destroying their candidate. That is not, properly speaking, how an election is “rigged.” The media are generally private actors, even when they are pro-government. And there are alternative media, such as Breitbart News and others, that provide a counterweight to the twisted mainstream.

Moreover, the media are always against the Republican Party and its candidates, even if they are more openly so in 2016 than they have ever been before. If this election is “rigged,” then so are the many past elections — most recently, 2014 — when the media tried to sway the result in favor of the Democrats and failed.

But what feels wrong to many Republican voters is that the slew of sexual allegations against Trump have arrived so late in the process. All of the accusations are many years, and even decades, old. There was no reason to withhold them during the Republican Party primary, when voters could have chosen an alternative.

And so many Republicans feel the media is trying to nullify their votes. To them, the election is indeed being “rigged,” albeit legally.

Luckily, they still have a chance to respond."
100645,1002,Washington Post/ABC News Poll: Statistical Tie in Presidential Race,http://www.breitbart.com/2016-presidential-race/2016/10/16/washington-postabc-news-poll-statistical-tie-presidential-race/,24,"Bucking the trend of recent national polls that showed Hillary Clinton pulling into a solid nationwide lead over Donald Trump, and the media consensus that his campaign just experienced Armageddon, the latest poll from ABC News and the Washington Post says the race is a statistical tie, with Clinton leading by only four points in a poll with a four-point margin of error.
Clinton’s lead is the same in a head-to-head matchup, or with independent candidates factored in. In a two-way race, ABC News/WaPo reports Clinton 50 percent, Trump 46 percent. With all four candidates in the mix, it’s Clinton 47 percent, Trump 43 percent, Libertarian Gary Johnson 5 percent, and the Green Party’s Jill Stein two percent.

The survey was conducted between October 10 and October 13, with a modest sample size for a national survey, 740 likely voters. 90 percent of respondents said they were following the presidential race very or somewhat closely, and 85 percent said they were absolutely certain to vote.

Clinton and Trump had roughly comparable percentages of voters who said they were “locked in” and would not change their minds before the election, and comparable levels of enthusiasm from their voters. As in most other surveys, both candidates are “underwater” in their favorable/unfavorable ratings, but Trump’s were worse – 43 percent to 53 percent for Clinton, 31 percent to 66 percent for Trump. They have nearly identical ratings for honesty, with 34 percent describing each of them as honest and trustworthy.

ABC/WaPo’s respondents thought Clinton won the second presidential debate by a margin of 45 percent to 32 percent.

Interestingly, the two major-party candidates are within a point or two of each other on most of the major issues – the economy, immigration, and terrorism. Clinton is more trusted to handle an international crisis (55 percent to 39 percent) and more trusted to handle ethics in government (45 percent to 37 percent). The latter result must be a great relief to the Clinton campaign, given her history, and the news currently emerging from WikiLeaks.

Clinton leads Trump by 69 percent to 22 percent on “women’s rights,” and 55 percent said Trump’s treatment of women was a legit issue in the campaign, which would seem to suggest the big negative news for him has been making an impact… but then only 35 percent of respondents said the videotape of Trump’s lewd remarks from 11 years ago made them less likely to vote for him.

A similar percentage (34 percent) said that Hillary Clinton’s mistreatment of women who accused Bill Clinton of sexual harassment and sexual assault was a relevant issue in the 2016 presidential campaign."
100646,1002,Small Town Texas Restaurant Delivers Cajun Spice and Strong Support for Trump,http://www.breitbart.com/texas/2016/10/16/small-town-texas-restaurant-delivers-cajun-spice-strong-support-trump/,24,"LIVINGSTON, Texas — Breitbart Texas was in Livingston, Texas, approximately 74 miles north of Houston, when we spotted a Cajun seafood restaurant just loaded with Trump/Pence placards and some local county political race signs.
Breitbart Texas talked to Manny and Nancy Rachal, owners of Shrimp Boat Manny’s in Polk County, Texas after we stopped there for a late lunch. When asked about their support for the Republican presidential nominee, the Rachals said, “As Christians and as small business owners, we are hoping and praying for Trump.” “We see Mr. Trump running the federal government as the business that it is. He will lower taxes, getting the economic engines rolling again and creating opportunity for businesses to grow. We agree with his announcement last summer, when he said ‘I have a gift for creating jobs.’ This would reduce unemployment, putting more money into hands.”

The Rachal’s Cajun restaurant is in Livingston, a population of approximately 5,500 just ten miles east of Lake Livingston, a reservoir in East Texas surrounded by piney woods. They started their restaurant in early 1985 when Manny felt there was a “need” for boiled crawfish in the area. He was a 33-year-old father of three little ones and he said he could use “a few more dollars.” He sold life insurance during the week and headed to Livingston from Houston on the weekends. He set up a tent and a butane burner rig and his boiled crawfish soon became a local favorite. Topping the list of “Why Trump?,” Nancy answered, “The next presidential appointments of Supreme Court Justices.”

She added, “If Hillary Clinton wins, her appointments will re-write the American Constitution, deleting freedom of religion, speech and the right to bear arms, and will continue to support the abomination of partial birth abortions.” She contrasted GOP presidential candidate Donald Trump and said he “has gone so far as to name his list of candidates. He certainly has proven his ability to choose good character, in choosing Mike Pence as his running mate.”

As to religious liberty Rachal explained, “Trump has even said he would look into repealing the Johnson Law, allowing the pulpits of faith in this country to speak freely in regard to our governmental leadership.” With regard to the issue of immigration, the small town Republicans said, “Trump was the first to seriously address the political stink-bomb of illegal immigration, a plan to enforce our laws and secure our borders.”

On the security of our nation, “He will rebuild, modernize, and strengthen our military at home and abroad, and return respect to our law enforcement and to our veterans, in letting them know their President and Commander-in-Chief stands with them, unafraid of the PC monster.” The Rachals said they could sum-up their support this way. “We feel that, after many, many, years of frustration, we finally have a voice for common people who have common sense – Donald J. Trump!”

A brochure from Shrimp Boat Manny’s says, “We praise Jesus that we will continue to grow, expand and serve our community in the Louisiana Cajun way – with a warm heart and a friendly smile.”

The Rachal’s daughter, Ryan, was a delight, and the staff was helpful and friendly – but the Etouffee and Cajun Potato Casserole – the best Cajun cuisine I have ever tasted. The casserole just melted in my mouth but had this incredible flavor.

Visiting small Texas towns, and meeting salt-of-the-earth Americans, just reminds me of the good in America."
100647,1003,The State of our Democracy,http://www.huffingtonpost.com/byron-williams/the-state-of-our-democrac_b_12515486.html?utm_hp_ref=politics,24,"Democracy is a device that ensures we shall be governed no better than we deserve.”
— George Bernard Shaw

I often refer to Shaw’s quote because I find it to be the most succinct and accurate analysis of our democratic-republic form of government.

But the reality show, masquerading as the 2016 presidential election, should force us to ask: “Do we deserve this?” Prior to offering a reflexive response, consider my definition of the pronoun “this.”

“This” is not a critique on Hillary Clinton or Donald Trump, but one directed at “us.” Do we the people deserve this spectacle?

Cynically speaking, I say we do. We have failed the “salami test” miserably.

Imagine you had a stick of salami and a traveler stopped by and asked you for half. You immediately say “No!” So instead, the traveler takes only a sliver. Because it is not enough to care, you say nothing. But over the next few days, they repeat the process to a point that what’s left is no longer worth concerning yourself.

The 2016 presidential election may have brought us to this precipice. It’s not Fort Sumter, where a shot was fired and the country was immediately placed on the verge of being torn asunder. It has been more methodical, seemingly harmless in the moment. But the election, collectively, has worked in tandem with other so-called innocuous episodes, and the result is a divided nation — some hopeful but a larger majority either nihilistic or close to it.

When did party become more important than country? When did we become a nation that is only bothered by statements coming from the candidate we don’t support?

In addition to being fortified by the news source that corresponds with our pre-existing beliefs, part of the current General Election tradition is to anticipate the arrival of the “October surprise.”

From the political colonoscopy known as the Benghazi investigation to Trump’s latest tweet, what will be the next news story de jour that we are told to care about?

Of all the outlandish statements that Trump has made during his run for president, nothing bothered me more than when he threatened Clinton with jail at their second debate.

“If I win I am going to instruct my attorney general to get a special prosecutor to look into your situation — there have never been so many lies and so much deception,” Trump said.

In that single statement, not only did Trump demonstrate little regard or understanding of the Constitution, but he also violated the ethos of the American experiment.

How does Trump’s statement square with the following?

And for the support of this Declaration, with a firm reliance on the protection of divine Providence, we mutually pledge to each other our Lives, our Fortunes and our sacred Honor.

When the undersigned placed their names below the aforementioned quote on July 4, 1776, they were putting their lives on the line, beginning the pursuit of “a more perfect union” where such tyrannical governments like the one Trump advocated did not exist.

That was the Trump moment where collective condemnation was warranted. But the current political culture suggests the prospect of being governed in a Banana Republic is worth the risk, if it means the opposition is defeated.

Obstruction has become a viable tactic in doing the people’s business. Is it acceptable? It depends on whom you ask. It’s fundamentally abhorrent because at the core it places party over country.

This is reflective of a faux patriotism that is corrosive to our democratic values. I have long believed that divided government was best to move the nation forward. But we have become a country that only moves forward when one party controls Congress and occupies the White House.

The problem with this option is that it assumes wrongly that the minority opinion has no value. When did governing become a zero-sum game? Is a de facto fiat the only way to conduct the people’s business? It sure seems that is the only option available.

We have somehow comingled the definitions between patriotism and nationalism. If we can agree that patriotism is love and devotion of country, how does that differ from nationalism?

Simply stated, nationalism finds it roots in naivety. It does not question, it embraces a form of certainty that makes it vulnerable to the seductive impulses of nativism.

Patriotism embraces dissent, which is the oxygen of democracy. It places the overarching values of the country over the short-term interests of the party.

The hopeful or tragic reality remains: whichever road we take, Shaw is right.

100648,1003,Letter to a Trump Supporter #3: Liberation Theology,http://www.huffingtonpost.com/anthony-w-orlando/letter-to-a-trump-support_b_12514766.html?utm_hp_ref=politics,24,"This is the third in my series of “Letters to a Trump Supporter,” from correspondence with a family friend who supports Mr. Trump.

Continuing our conversation about Central and South America, he sent me a blog post accusing Tim Kaine of being a Marxist for his association with “liberation theology.”

If you haven’t heard of liberation theology before, you’re not alone. It’s a relic of the Cold War, when it was used to paint Latinos as a threat to the United States. It plays on the same fears as the rest of Mr. Trump’s nativism.

Below is my response.

~~~~~~~~~~

Dear Mr. ——,

Liberation theology is a fascinating branch of Catholicism. I find a lot to admire in it for its service to the poor and its pursuit of social justice.

Its most famous proponent was probably Óscar Romero, the Archbishop of San Salvador. Pope John Paul II gave him the official title of Servant of God, Pope Benedict XVI nominated him for beatification, and Pope Francis officially beatified him. So, far from opposing liberation theology, the last three Popes have been very supportive of liberation theologists like Romero.

Archbishop Romero was assassinated in 1980 by US-backed Salvadoran troops, one of many casualties of US-backed regimes in the Cold War. So, before we starting throwing around words like “Marxist,” we should be aware of where those attacks have led us in the past.

I think it is particularly disturbing to see Catholics criticizing Tim Kaine’s beliefs at a time when he is running against a campaign that Pope Francis has publicly declared is “not Christian,” to which Donald Trump replied by calling the Pope of the Catholic Church “disgraceful.”

It’s not surprising, therefore, that a long list of Catholic conservatives published an open letter in the National Review imploring their fellow Catholic voters to vote against Mr. Trump.

Nor is it surprising that Mr. Trump is alienating the fastest growing block of Catholic voters in the country, Latinos. This hostility to Latinos, after all, dates back to the Cold War, when it led to the deaths of Óscar Romero and his fellow Catholics.

Best regards,
Anthony"

How could there be an upside to a campaign that makes one wonder whether it’s safe for children to watch the evening news or even presidential debates?

Frankly, Donald Trump’s candidacy is so offensive, so frightening and so unprecedented in the United States that it compels us to a much-needed collective focus on decency and civic engagement — a renewal of civitas.

In my lifetime, I have seen plenty of elections in which the candidates attacked each other. But I have never seen a candidate for president undermine the bedrock principles of our constitutional democracy.

Donald Trump has incited his supporters to use violence against peaceful protesters. He has called for a ban on members of an entire religion from entering the United States. He has disparaged African-Americans, Mexicans and the disabled. He has said he would jail his political opponent and led his supporters in chants of “Lock her up.”

When his campaign has faltered, he has raised the unfounded specter that the election could be rigged against him.

This election is not just about politics and policies, but about human decency.
Trump has denigrated women, boasted about repeatedly sexually assaulting women, and hurled vicious verbal attacks against women who report they were assaulted by him. First lady Michelle Obama spoke for many Americans when she gave a speech last week reminding voters that this election is not just about politics and policies, but about human decency.

If the election were held today, polls suggest Hillary Clinton would prevail. But regardless of the outcome, our country has a Nov. 9 problem. Trump has tapped into a populist anger that animates America and has used it to stoke hatred and divide the country. He has seized on the economic challenges confronting Americans, and instead of bringing the country together around solutions, he is sowing division.

America is changing demographically and economically. Deindustrialization, globalization, the technological revolution and the diminishment of the labor movement have left Americans feeling powerless. The loss of good jobs and good pensions, wage stagnation, and escalating child care and college costs have left people angry and anxious, and they are desperately looking for someone who can bring change. Trump says he is their champion, but his plans would be devastating for the very people he claims he will help.

People need to know the facts. The chief economist of Moody’s Analytics, who has advised prominent Republicans, concluded that Trump’s economic proposals would cost 3.5 million Americans their jobs and lead to a long recession. (The same economist estimated that Hillary Clinton’s economic plan would create 10.4 million well-paying jobs.) Trump’s proposals regarding taxes, child care and the economy advantage the wealthy over low- and middle-income Americans. And he would decimate America’s public schools by voucherizing them.

The toxic rhetoric of the Trump campaign has filtered down to affect many children and schools. A middle school teacher in Dearborn, Mich., reports that Muslim students have stopped wearing anything that could identify them by their faith. A children’s therapist in New Mexico says her daughters came home from school asking if it’s ok for boys to grab them or try to kiss them, because boys at school are saying “Donald Trump does it.” A survey conducted by the Southern Poverty Law Center found steep increases in anti-Muslim or anti-immigrant comments, and an alarming level of fear and anxiety among children of color—what many have called the “Trump Effect.“

Once the election is over, we will need a collective effort to bind the wounds and address the divisions caused by this polarizing campaign. This will require a national effort, and our public schools can play a central role. Public education has been a bulwark for democracy, respect and diversity — what the American Federation of Teachers calls “democracy in education, education for democracy.” Our educators and students will be the first responders in this fight for our democracy, and we will need to give them the time and latitude to fulfill their vital civic function.

Children of all different races, religions, cultures and economic means attend public schools. Young people understand that words and actions have consequences, and that bigotry and bullying are unacceptable. Their teachers are well-schooled in helping students discern fact from fiction, demagoguery from democracy, and they are experienced in creating pathways toward aspiration and away from hate. We need to send young people into adulthood knowing their rights, responsibilities and power as citizens to be the drum majors of democracy. And that, indeed, would be our civitas moment."
100650,1006,Hillary Clinton doesn’t support that higher minimum wage she’s promising to voters,http://hotair.com/archives/2016/10/16/hillary-clinton-doesnt-support-higher-minimum-wage-shes-promising-voters/,24,"One problem with the Wikileaks release of all these Clinton emails in such a short period of time is that it’s almost impossible to really dig into all of them. Fortunately, other folks such as those at the Washington Times have been doing the leg work and digging up some of the good stuff. One item of note was the revelation that Hillary Clinton’s public opinion probably isn’t quite the same as her private opinion when it comes to the subject of the minimum wage and the Fight for 15 which so many of her supporters are rallying behind. As it turns out, she’s had some information in hand for quite a while now which shows that even liberal economists know this is a disaster in the making.

Among the illegally obtained and leaked emails of senior Clinton campaign staffer John Podesta are several gems, one of which is a warning from Neera Tanden, head of the left-wing Center for American Progress that Podesta helped found. In an email chain discussing New York City Mayor Bill DeBlasio’s decision to come out in favor of more than doubling the minimum wage, Tanden noted that her group had not formally come out for it, and warned that Clinton shouldn’t either.

“Substantively, we have not supported $15 — you will get a fair number of liberal economists who will say it will lose jobs,” she wrote. Still, eleven months later, she was among those praising California Gov. Jerry Brown for signing legislation that will make $15 the minimum wage in California. And Clinton, though supportive of some local efforts, has avoided backing a national $15 wage, in spite of pressure from her left to do so.
Clinton had been out on the campaign trail publicly cheering the individual states which enact a fifteen dollar per hour minimum wage, while still holding a more reserved approach on the national level. (She previously supported a roughly $12 per hour level.) But later in her primary fight against Bernie Sanders she began sounding more and more as if she was ready to take the Fight for 15 to the federal stage.

Don’t bet on it. We now see that Clinton has been sitting on information which shows what most of us already knew: this would destroy jobs for the most vulnerable workers on a broad scale. One of the biggest reasons, as shown in the linked release, is the simple fact that relatively few minimum wage workers are heads of household or currently living under the poverty level. Most of those jobs are entry level positions which require the lowest levels of skill and experience, so they are taken by young people looking to get that first entry on their resume.

When you force employers to offer a substantially higher wage they will be able to be far more choosy in who gets the remaining positions they can afford to pay for. This means that older, more experienced workers will be attracted to those jobs, shutting out the younger people looking to enter the workforce with no skills or background. The other employer responses such as cutting the number of new hires and turning to suddenly affordable automation will add to the flood of people turning to the unemployment lines.

It’s obvious that Clinton knows all of this already and it’s unlikely that the Fight for 15 crowd will find themselves very satisfied with their champion if she gets into office. Will that matter to them at the voting booth? Probably not. I think most of us are used to those public positions evaporating once the votes have been counted."
100651,1006,"Mike Pence: Absolutely, we’ll accept the results of the election",http://hotair.com/archives/2016/10/16/mike-pence-absolutely-well-accept-results-election/,24,"You’ll see below that Pence is doing his best to split the difference between Trump, whose brain will never allow him to believe that he lost a popularity contest to a loser like Hillary Clinton, and the national GOP, which will feel obliged for civic reasons to acknowledge that Clinton did indeed win fair and square. Splitting the difference in this case means backing up Trump on his claim that the media is neck-deep in the tank for Hillary, which of course is true, while inching away from the idea that media bias alone is enough to delegitimize a Clinton victory. Here’s how Pence phrased it in another interview this morning:

“I think what Donald Trump is talking about is frankly what appears to be the monolithic support of the national media for Hillary Clinton’s campaign, their willful ignorance about the avalanche of hard evidence,” Pence said.

“We’ll respect the outcome of this election,” he continued. “Well, look, let me be very clear. Donald Trump said in the first debate that we’ll respect the will of the American people in this election. The peaceful transfer of power is a hallmark of American history. And, and elections get really tough. But, but the American people are getting awful tired of this two-on-one fight with many of you in the national media doing half of Hillary Clinton’s work for her every day.”
I assume Pence already understands that if Trump crashes and burns next week, he’ll be the GOP’s — and the dreaded media’s — go-to guy the day after the election for a proper concession to Clinton. Others will be asked to concede on Trump’s behalf too, starting with Reince Priebus and Paul Ryan, and both will comply, but concessions from people attached to the campaign will be especially prized since they’re somewhat immune via their association with Trump to Trumpers’ inevitable accusations that they’re part of the “rigging” conspiracy. Kellyanne Conway, as Trump’s most visible and “reasonable” media surrogate, will be under particularly heavy pressure to acknowledge Clinton’s win as legit, but no one will be under as much pressure as Pence. And he surely knows it: If he was going to go all-in on the “rigged” argument, he would have done it here. He didn’t because he knows that would make his life even harder next month, when he finally finds himself pitted squarely against Trump in Trump’s campaign to disrupt the peaceful transfer of power.

Even after the election, many Democrats and Republicans fear, Trump could keep showing up at rallies. He’s all but certain to keep up his near-constant claim of a “rigged election” on Twitter and in friendly news interviews, casting doubts and stoking a toxicity that, at least as of now, relatively few in his party have explicitly rejected…

Only Republicans—and maybe leaders from the right who aren’t going to be suspected to be part of the “establishment”—will be able to move the country forward if Trump won’t, many agree.

“This is on them. They’ve created this. They need to defuse,” said a senior Democrat on Saturday evening…

Former Virginia Rep. Tom Davis predicted that Republicans leaders and voters alike will quickly accept the results and move past the election, blaming the loss on Trump and washing their hands of him—unless it’s another close result where the winner is decided by hanging chads and court cases.
If we’re going to howl about media bias, incidentally, let’s make sure the timeline we’re using to judge extends further back than, say, a month ago. Remember this Shorenstein Center study of media coverage during the Republican primaries? The media’s been laying the groundwork for a Clinton victory since last June, and job one in doing that was handing saturation coverage to the weakest, least organized, most self-destructive candidate in the Republican primary field: Trump received 34 percent of all news media coverage of Republicans in the primaries, easily more than the 18 percent that second-place finisher Jeb Bush got. That was worth $55 million to him in free advertising by one estimate. A different estimate, by the New York Times, put that number way, way, way higher at no less than $2 billion, rendering irrelevant Trump’s weak ground game and minimal fundraising. And they did this full in the knowledge that Trump has been phenomenally and consistently unpopular among the wider electorate since last summer when he joined the race. They could have aggressively pursued the rumors about his interactions with women at any point before the convention this summer, but if they had, it would have helped Ted Cruz or Marco Rubio and that in turn would have hurt Democrats comparatively. If you’re desperate for a media conspiracy to explain this election, in which a Democrat now looks poised to win easily even though various fundamentals pointed to a generic Republican advantage, that’s a fine place to start. The media helped create Trump the politician in the expectation that he’d be the easiest to destroy. They were right.

Here’s Pence followed by Newt Gingrich addressing Trump’s “rigging” allegations far less delicately, comparing the media dumpster-diving to a “coup d’etat” and guessing that Trump would be up 15 points if the press were fair, which is extremely stupid given the demographics of the country and Trump’s own compulsion towards self-destruction but makes for some nice ointment for sore Trumpers. Why is Pence being circumspect about Trump’s “rigging” claims while Newt is going hog wild? Simple: Pence still potentially has a future as a national figure whereas Gingrich doesn’t. Newt can afford to be as irresponsible as he likes.

100652,1006,Sunday morning talking heads,http://hotair.com/archives/2016/10/16/sunday-morning-talking-heads-33/,24,"Give Mike Pence credit for facing the fire this morning. After a week of seamy allegations about sexual assault and Trump goofing on his accusers’ looks, it’d be easy for Pence to beg off appearing on the Sunday shows and farm this clean-up job out to lesser surrogates like Rudy Giuliani and Newt Gingrich. Instead, as of Saturday afternoon, he’s booked for “Meet the Press,” “Face the Nation,” and “Fox News Sunday.” Chuck Todd et al. are going to come right at him for what he said Friday morning about forthcoming evidence that would debunk some of the charges against Trump. Is … this guy’s story the evidence he had in mind? Or, more likely, did the campaign assure Pence early Friday that they had something cooking that would impeach Trump’s accuser without telling him specifically what it was? Now he has to go out there and vouch for Gilberthorpe’s credibility. Oh well. He bought the ticket. Take the ride.

Giuliani and Gingrich are booked too this morning, for “State of the Union” and “This Week,” respectively. For Democrats, it’s VPs present and possibly future: Joe Biden will follow Pence on “Meet the Press” while Tim Kaine is set for “This Week,” “Face the Nation,” and “Fox News Sunday.” A conspicuous omission this morning is Kellyanne Conway. You would think, after a week like this, the campaign would want its most prominent and likable woman surrogate out there helping to put out the fire. Maybe she’ll be a late addition to the schedule.

It’s also places like Twitter, Facebook, and Google who push information critical of Donald Trump and favorable of Hillary.

Virtually all big companies are backed by liberal elitists, and they want their candidate to win – even if it means cheating.

Cheating isn’t anything new to liberals, but they go about it so blatantly these days.

In a bit of good news, it appears searches titled “how to vote for Trump” is destroying “how to vote for Hillary.”

From Regated: Don’t we just love our Google data, folks? I swear, we have the best Google data! Granted, Google has already censored crucial election data, but thank god that the Google Trends tool is still a thing.

… Although, being that “how to vote for Trump” is crushing Hillary, the Clinton camp should be very concerned. Seriously, “how to vote for Trump” has nearly twice as many searches as “how to vote for Hillary”. Feel free to spin that as “uneducated” Trump supporters. But, the fact that more potential voters are searching how to vote for Trump should be extremely telling. This is nice and all, but do people really not know how to vote?

Either you get an early ballot or you go to your polling station.

…and their minds were blown…

Maybe by searching “how to vote for Trump” people are wondering where their polling stations are located.

Fairly reasonable statement, no?

There will definitely be plenty of Obama supporters who spurn Clinton and side with Trump, but it certainly won’t be anywhere near the majority.

A recent NBC/WSJ poll shows Hillary with an 11-point lead over rival Trump, 48%-37% nationally.

The problem here is that of the 1,000 people polled 46% of them voted for Obama in 2012, compared to 32% for Romney.

Ultimately, their numbers are skewed.


From Gateway Pundit:

The Wall Street Journal-NBC News poll released Sunday morning attempts to bury the campaign of Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump going onto the third and final debate with Democrat presidential nominee Hillary Clinton with a poll that gives Clinton a daunting eleven point lead among likely voters, 48% to 37%. A deep dive in the internals of the poll shows those interviewed voted in 2012 for incumbent Barack Obama 46% to 32% over Mitt Romney. Very.

Something about that sound a little off to you?

Could it be because Clinton has said publicly she wants to reform Wall Street?

Isn’t that what all Democrats want?

Classic.

Guess that brings us back to the whole public vs. private position deal. From Breitbart:

Clinton said in an October 24, 2013 speech to Goldman, according to newly leaked Goldman Sachs speech transcripts unearthed during the Wikileaks dump of John Podesta’s emails: I represented all of you for eight years. I had great relations and worked so close together after 9/11 to rebuild downtown, and a lot of respect for the work you do and the people who do it, but I do — I think that when we talk about the regulators and the politicians, the economic consequences of bad decisions back in ’08, you know, were devastating, and they had repercussions throughout the world.

In the past, Hillary referred to herself as Goldman Sachs’ “partner in government”… Then-Senator Clinton, who is under fire from Bernie Sanders for her close ties to the investment firm, identified herself as Goldman Sachs’ “partner in government” at the 2005 groundbreaking of the firm’s new 740-foot-tall headquarters in Lower Manhattan. Goldman Sachs won federal government Liberty Bonds to build it.

“Following the tragic events of September 11th, I was proud to have worked with my colleagues in Congress to secure $20 billion in federal aid for New York,” Clinton said. “Major employers like Goldman Sachs needed to know they had a partner in government to ensure that Lower Manhattan could continue to sustain their businesses in the area, I am pleased to be an ongoing partner in supporting economic development in Lower Manhattan and thank Goldman Sachs for their commitment to the future of Lower Manhattan and New York City.”

It’s not exactly a shock that Hillary speaks out of both sides of her mouth. Unfortunately, the MSM won’t report on this so the uninformed will never know a thing about it.

Makes sense why Clinton wants to build on Obama’s “legacy.”

The two are virtually the same person, with the exception being Clinton is even more repulsive."
100656,1008,This Election Isn't about Trump,http://www.americanthinker.com/articles/2016/10/this_election_isnt_about_trump.html,24,"This election is not about Donald Trump. The name on the Republican presidential ballot could have been any of the 16 that ran in the primary races. The name doesn’t matter. What matters is the reason for winning. The reason is to restore the heart of America.

Ask yourself, do you really want Obamcare for the rest of your lives, your children’s lives? Each year it gets engrained more and more into our society making it harder to get rid of. If the Democrats win it stays; if they gain back control of the House and Senate, they may add to it. Even Bill Clinton in Michigan this past week said it was crazy.

Again, the name Trump on the top of the ticket does not matter. I hear you, I understand: his language against women, his alleged assaults. You are right, it’s bad; so is the language in locker rooms or bars or other places men hang out. This is a diversion from our main mission.

Ask yourself; can I really trust Mrs. Clinton? If she wins, we have heard her statements on issues like Benghazi. They asked for increased security and the State Dept. never gave it. Former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton said the attack was due to a video, but we found out later she knew different. She has a long history of lying to the American people. Back in 1996 she claimed when she landed in Bosnia she had to run cause she was under sniper fire.

These are just two of her many, many lies to the American people. Do you really fear Donald Trump more?

Again, don’t let Donald Trump being president scare you. With all his faults, you can trust him a whole lot more than Hillary. I still hear you: what about his taxes or going bankrupt? It all window dressing to get you off track of our real goal, and that is to take back America. Sure 4 of his hundreds of business ventures went bankrupt; millions of people in America have, and yes his was way larger. It’s allowed. He is a businessman and business people use bankruptcy all the time to improve their positions, to save money, keep jobs. Look at General Motors; are you saying you will never buy a GM car because they went bankrupt?  Tax deductions? We all take whatever the law lets us take. That’s why you go to places like H&R Block or buy that computer software, so you become aware of the tax deductions you are allowed to take. I’m sure some of you have had loses and carried them forward to avoid paying taxes just as Mr. Trump did. Well except his were larger than yours or mine. It’s okay, don’t get distracted by it.

Republicans are different in many ways from Democrats and I am not talking political views. The overall view of Democrats seems to be, the end justifies the means. I can hear you now saying, that’s not true, and we care. Well, when was the last time a Democrat was thrown out of office for doing something wrong? No it wasn’t Charles Rangel, even though he was found guilty on 11 counts of House ethics violations, failing to report rental income from a villa in the Dominican Republic, (How do you forget you own an multi million dollar villa?) It was Anthony Weiner for his photos and he almost got away with it. Hard working union Democrats still love Bill Clinton even if he signed NAFTA into law and cost many of them their jobs. Many Democrats are great Catholic believing people, but they still vote for Democrats who are pro-abortion. Democrats are willing to divide their beliefs in order to get the ends that they want and stay united in the process.

Republicans, well we like to bury our wounded. First to get elected you have to pass a whole set of litmus tests to see if you are conservative enough, if you agree on all the right issues, get the proper endorsements, then you have to get elected with only partial support of all GOP voters since you may not have passed all their tests. Then if you drop the ball somewhere along the way, you get beat up on by your own party and if it’s bad enough you are thrown out, while the Democrats just watch while we do their work for them. Why can’t we unite like the Democrats do?

We are killing ourselves and letting the other side win! Why? The GOP needs to do something it may have never done, and that is getting united against a common foe. Look at Hillary Rodham Clinton. Do you really want her, America? Will she go back to “President Rodham” if elected? Will you let it happen just because we do not have a perfect candidate?

Really? Well that perfect choice is not coming to run for president. A half a sandwich to a starving man is better than no food at all.

I consider myself a conservative first, then a Republican, but I am a realist too. Yes I want a candidate to walk and talk and believe in a certain way. But, I want to first of all make sure the other side doesn’t win.  Because their beliefs are truly not my beliefs.

I know it’s rare, if not impossible to get a candidate that matches up 100% to what you want. So we have to choose. Thus I beg you, I plead with you to really look at what Hillary will and can do if elected president. If you say I am still voting for Hillary cause I just can’t stand Trump, well don’t complain about what you will get in the next 8 years. Yes, I said 8 years because I see no one on the horizon that will defeat her if elected in 4 years. That means liberal laws, liberal judges, more lies to the America people. You will have wished you had voted for Trump. If Trump wins he still will have to deal with Congress to get his ideas past and that isn’t so easy. Just look who is running both Houses.

So I say for the last time, this election is not about Donald Trump. The name doesn’t matter. What matters is the reason for winning. The reason is to restore the heart of America.

100657,1008,Surrendering to the Spirit of the Age,http://www.americanthinker.com/articles/2016/10/surrendering_to_the_spirit_of_the_age.html,24,"Since Jesus famously took out a coin and said ""render unto Caesar that which is Caesar's and unto God that which is God's"" the Church and State have been separated. As St. Augustine famously put it, there is a city of God and a city of Man. The Middle Ages illustrated that division more than most eras; with the relative weakness of political rulers the Catholic Church exercised considerable authority on a temporal level. That authority proved too great for the invading Islamic armies, who never were able to gain a foothold in Western Europe, while in the East, where the successor to the Roman Empire held the Church in a vassal state, Islam flourished and eventually drove the Orthodox Churches out. The bifurcation of power in the West made them strong, able to resist the invasion of the resurrected Arian and Manichean heresy that was Islam. And when the Catholic Church grew too chummy with the political powers there was a rebellion (the Protestant Reformation) which fractured the ability of the ruling class to use religion as a tool of societal domination.

But the rise of modern statism and the subsequent retreat of Christianity made it easy to secularize and conquer. If you can't beat 'em, join 'em, the old saying goes, and the Progressive/Leftist movement has spent decades subverting Christianity. How?

Like the human brain, the Church has two hemispheres, one spiritual and one worldly. In fact, in Catholicism there are two sets of works of mercy, the spiritual and the corporal. Jesus understood the physical/corporal needs of the people, and he fed them, clothed them, healed their illnesses. But was that his mission? No; Jesus did not come to heal the bodies of people who would die in this world and be forever out in the cold in the next (or in the heat, if you prefer). The most fundamental mission of Jesus was to die and be resurrected and by so doing open the road to Heaven for Humanity. In the case of Christianity, the spiritual hemisphere is the greater of the two; the City of God reigns over the City of Man.

Or so it should. One of the ways the Left has sought to destroy the Church is by promoting and embracing the corporal works over the spiritual. It is not because they want to help people but rather they want to destroy Christianity, and to do so they must wage war with Christian's own tools. The Social Gospel is a bludgeon to beat the Gospel of Salvation. Most liberals do not believe in the Christian concept of Salvation, thinking that they are just fine as they are and that there likely is no afterlife anyway. Corporal works are elevated, and this numbs the average Christian who want to obey the teachings of Christ to feed the hungry and cloth the naked. So, numerous Catholics supported Barack Obama, despite his positions being antithetical to most Catholic teachings, simply because he has usurped the corporal works of mercy. Many of these same Catholics will vote for Hillary for the same reason; they think she is in tune with Catholic beliefs because she wants to steal money from some to give to others and call it charity. Real charity is a voluntary act done on an individual level. Forced charity is nothing but theft, and it steals the opportunity of the giver to practice virtue. Oh... and it doesn't work; few beneficiaries of the welfare state will have anything but a subsistence level of existence. It is a tool for enslaving swaths of the population.

The Eternal Things -- the Soul, Heaven, Hell, Purgatory, Angels and Demons -- are to become children's fables, things that no serious person could believe. Atheist John Lennon gave us the roadmap in his song “Imagine”:

“Imagine there’s no Heaven… No Hell below us… Imagine all the People living for today.""

Which brings us to the recent Wikileaks e-mail dump. Hillary’s Consiglier John Podesta conspired with Voice for Progress founder Sandy Newman:

“There needs to be a Catholic Spring, in which Catholics themselves demand the end of a middle ages dictatorship and the beginning of a little democracy and respect for gender equality in the Catholic Church,” Sandy Newman, president and founder of the progressive nonprofit Voices for Progress, writes to Podesta in an email titled “opening for a Catholic Spring? just musing.”…

“We created Catholics in Alliance for the Common Good to organize for a moment like this. But I think it lacks the leadership to do so now. Likewise Catholics United. Like most Spring movements, I think this one will have to be bottom up,” Podesta writes…""

Catholicism is not a democracy, and for a good reason. The Creator of all that is, was, could be, and might be did not make ""suggestions"" when He commanded things. ""Thou shalt not commit adultery"" is not open to negotiation, for instance; it is a command, one that must be obeyed or you will suffer the consequences.

Christianity is ultimately about eternal things. Therein lies the problem with so much of modern Christianity; it disdains the spiritual, ultimate purpose in favor of a social gospel. Jesus commanded that we do good works, the ""corporal mercies"" but only as part of the bigger picture, which is to save souls from eternal damnation. Feeding a poor person whom you then bless on their road to hell is of absolutely no value. Jesus said ""if your eye offends thee, pluck it out; it is better to enter the Kingdom of Heaven with one eye than to have two eyes and be thrown into Hell.""

Or as Paul put it, ""what does it profit a man to gain the whole world and lose his soul?""

So the purpose of Christianity is not to feed someone who will be hungry tomorrow but to save them from a far worse fate. Gay marriage, abortion, promiscuity, etc. lead to just such a fate. Catholicism cannot in any way ""come out of the Middle Ages"" and still have any purpose in this world. Modernism for the Church is suicide.

And frankly, it is the antithesis of love to excuse something that will lead a person to damnation. We correct our children out of love, after all. It may seem cruel to the child but we know better. Rebelling against the Word of God is much like rebelling against gravity; you are free to do so but you had better be prepared to suffer and perhaps die. A good Catholic does not want that for another.

The Pope is believed by Catholics to be infallible under certain unique circumstances (ex cathedra) and he and the Church hierarchy are to be listened to although not necessarily followed blindly. This predates the Middle Ages, I might add.

In Matthew 15:10 Jesus tells Peter, the first Pope:

""I will give you the keys of the kingdom of heaven, and whatever you bind on earth shall be bound in heaven, and whatever you loose on earth shall be loosed in heaven.”

In other words, the Pope is the boss (at least as Catholics see it) and matters of faith and morals are not open to a vote.

In typical liberal fashion, Newman takes this doctrine back to the Middle Ages, a time the Left has trashed because it serves their own purposes. (Ask a Medieval historian about the Middle Ages and you will get a very different picture than the one painted by modern consensus.) Podesta ignores, too, the fact that things like gay marriage are historically unprecedented and that by virtue of legal precedent alone one should be very wary of it. No society in history has allowed two people of the same sex to marry. The first time it ever happened was with the same sex partnership law of Sweden 1994. The first actual homosexual marriage law was signed in 2000 in the Netherlands (on Dec. 21, the pagan winter solstice, I might add.)

Before that, nada. The pro-homosexual wing makes much ado about classical Greeks sodomizing young teen boys (pederasty) but Plato saw this as an abomination and proposed the death penalty for homosexual behavior. And it further should be pointed out that the Greek city-states allied against Athens -- center of this abominable custom -- during the Peloponnesian wars, and that Greeks enjoyed a horrible reputation in the ancient world as a result of tolerating this.

The fact is that history is against so many of the ""innovations"" of the modern Left. Newman ignores Natural Law. He ignores historical precedent. He ignores the spiritual nature of Catholicism. He is either woefully ignorant of the reality that is Catholicism or he simply ignores it because his god is the Progressive world order.

That said, Catholicism has been suffering attacks from the inside -- his ""Catholic Spring"" -- for quite some time. Liberation Theology, a creation of the Soviet Union, is one such example. Pope Francis had ties to Liberation Theology, which promotes a Marxist model for Christian works i.e. it's a revolutionary movement designed to co-opt Christian elements. (Pope John Paul II formally banned it, but Francis is allowing it to come back.)

And the pedophilia scandal in the Church was a direct result of a concerted effort by ""progressive"" types to remold the church, to reform it as a more worldly and cosmopolitan entity. It should be pointed out that there may well be as many -- or more -- pedophiles in public schools. Sexual immorality is the cornerstone of Progressive modernism, and the Church is simply following along with the rest of the creepy clowns.

Meanwhile, you have the subversion of funds from things like the Archdiocesan Development Appeal to fund radical leftists like ACORN. 

I give you -- and Newman and Podesta -- St. Anthony the Abbot - Fourth Century:


""Men will surrender to the spirit of the age. They will say that if they had lived in our day, faith would be simple and easy. But in their day, they will say, things are complex; the Church must be brought up to date and made meaningful to the day's problems. When the Church and the world are one, then those days are at hand.""

And as was stated by Our Lady of LaSalette in a Church-approved apparition of Mary in 1846:

""All the civil governments will have one and the same plan, which will be to abolish and do away with every religious principle to make way for materialism, atheism, spiritualism and vice of all kinds.""

The Church by its very nature is conservative because it deals with the absolutes, with things permanent and eternal. The concept of modernizing the Church is a slippery one because the human temptation is to embrace the World and enjoy the rebellion against God. Yes, it may be important to update certain external trappings of the Church, but it must not be at the expense of the fundamental purpose of Catholicism and Christianity in general, which is to guide as many souls as possible to Heaven. The liberals want us to forget that purpose.

What value does the Church have outside of that?

That is, to say women are voting in greater percentages for Clinton and men for Trump. Here’s his astonishing chart: 
“If men were the only voters, conversely, we’d have to subtract 10 points from Clinton’s current margin in every state -- which would yield an awfully red map. Trump would win everything that could plausibly be called a swing state, with Clinton hanging on only to the West Coast, parts of the Northeast, Illinois and New Mexico. That would yield 350 electoral votes for Trump to 188 for Clinton:”

This may well explain the Clinton effort to schlep before the cameras every woman who is willing to accuse Trump of making advances toward them no matter how flimsy, tardy and improbable the charge.

Hillary who asserted on her website HillaryClinton.com that women who claimed to have survived sexual assault “have the right to be believed” scrubbed that as Trump reminded voters of her husband’s depredations against women. 

Christina Jeffrey notes in correspondence how the term “sexual assault” has been stretched beyond rational meaning when it suits the left to do so:

Our side has done a good job of pointing out what real sexual assault looks like, so just for fun, I think I'll take up what the PC crowd wants to fight. Fighting rape and real sexual assault in the inner cities and by predatory older males against middle and high school students is difficult and the statistics tend to stigmatize African-American males. So the P.C. crowd goes after the kind of “sexual assault"" that is often quite benign and part of semi-modern/traditional courtship rituals.

Political Correctness has invaded every aspect of our lives; but the area where it is now being felt most intensely is in the sexual realm. While pushing ""Kiddie Porn"" to K-4 students as ""health education,"" and making statements in the press like this one: ""girls have to get used to seeing male genitalia"" as a defense for transgendered locker rooms"" (paraphrased, but not inaccurately), the PC education crowd insists that college women are constantly at risk of ""sexual assault."" If you properly define ""sexual assault"" as rape or intent to rape, college campuses are actually among the safest places for women of college age. If that were not true, no one would pay $50,000 or more to let their precious daughters attend college. And those of us who teach on these campuses, and are close to our students, would be aware that our women students were being constantly ""assaulted.""

When it suits them to do so they are perfectly willing to claim that a hug or kiss is a “sexual assault” in the absence of a notarized statement of consent.

My Facebook friend Lynn Chu apparently concurs with this analysis,” The invention of this term, and its misuse, was a deliberate propaganda effort to blur harmless romance including clumsiness or episodes gone awry often while both parties at colleges are drunk, with actual rape for which a prosecution and conviction would lie. The courts know how to do this, and universities and colleges do not. ”

Now they are trying to use such an expansion to cover dubious claims, often contested by other witnesses, about Trump.

We’ve seen such sexual propaganda before in the Duke and University of Virginia “rape” cases.

The young women whom these charges are designed to influence are astonishingly ill-informed as this tape of some of them who are for repealing women’s suffrage under the misguided belief that it means ""suffering"" or something reveals:


That some Republican politicians have backed off supporting Trump because of these allegations -- again underscoring my contempt for the white-togaed ninnies who also rankle Katie Hopkins at the Daily Mail:  

Fearful for their own political future, deserting Republican politicians have spoken of not being able to look their daughter in the eye and still back Trump, despite having made him the party's nominee.

Paul Ryan, the Speaker of the House, said 'women should be championed or revered, not objectified'.

For the record, I never want to be either of those two things. I am not a charitable cause. Being championed makes me sound incapable. And I certainly don't want to be revered — that's one step away from being embalmed in holy oil.

John McCain has jumped ship, too. Trying to swim away from the candidate nominated by his party, who has been entirely consistent in his campaign in saying things more sensitive souls find hard to hear.

Predictably the founder of Everyday Sexism was wheeled out from her feminist lair to reinforce Trump as a monster, applauded wildly by young women who need a trigger warning before they read Watership Down.”

She concludes the charges are “no worse than the Hillary-voting, smug rape-culture rappers who like to hang out at the Obama White House while peddling vile lyrics to kids that would make Trump blush.”

Michelle Obama claims that the offending Trump locker room boasts to Billy Bush which NBC sat on until now “shocked her to her core”. Perplexingly, she has also said she considers the half dressed, obscene singer and dancer Beyoncé a “role model” for her daughters. 

Nor have I forgotten the warm welcome women carrying giant dildos with the motto “cocks not glocks” received at the White House. 

Michelle’s husband’s display of his erect manhood before a planeload of women reporters none of who to my knowledge reported the incident and who now are getting all Victorian further suggests sexual vulgarity is not unknown to the Obama family.

Back in 2008, at least a portion of the below video of Obama flaunting himself did appear on CNN's website.

However, no media coverage made any reference to lewdness. There was just reference to the unremarkable news that Obama was... wearing jeans.

CNN captioned the clip with only what follows, which Michelle Malkin and Allahpundit took note of at the time:

“Obama in jeans: Sen. Barack Obama surprises the press corps by wearing jeans.”

It appears that the portion of the video that would have created a firestorm had been circumsized by CNN editors.”

I haven’t forgotten either when the left talked about Paula Jones as “trailer trash” when she successfully charged Hillary’s husband with real sexual misconduct or when Ann Coulter and Sarah Palin were called “c*nt” without press or Democratic rebuke. Everything, it seems, is relative. Women of the left are to be treated with care. Those in opposition are disrespected every possible way.

As tawdry as all this is, it has to be answered so if you are offended, I apologize, but there’s no sheltering behind good taste when mud is being slung by people whose record for sleaze and aggression is boundless.

I’m in full agreement with Dr. Hurd:  

Hypocrisy is a painful thing to watch. It’s beyond laughable to watch the biased media culture and all the Hillary-supporting politicians go Puritanical when it comes to sex. The morally righteous never had this problem with Bill Clinton, and they don’t have a problem with Hillary’s mind-numbing evasiveness when it comes to partnering with one of the highest profile sexual predators of all time.

Hypocrisy is a symptom. People are hypocrites only when they’re evading something big. What the Clintonistas try to hide is they care about only one thing: Power. They don’t care about respect for women, because to respect women you first have to respect individuality. Their entire lives have been based on the acquisition of political power and the millions of dollars they receive when that power is peddled and sold on the government market. They care nothing for the preservation of individual rights. They care only about rewarding their donors and advancing their socialist causes.

As for career politicians like John McCain and Paul Ryan, why should anyone care what they think? They are nothing more than managers for the collapsing imperial state. Their squandering of America’s Constitution and fiscal future for the sake of their own power trips makes Trump’s sleazy comments seem like nothing in comparison.

If you want to make the case for NOT voting for Donald Trump, you have to get real. This tape is the least plausible reason you can find. And if you’re not voting for Donald Trump, be prepared to defend why you did your part to let an actual criminal and lawbreaker -- Hillary Clinton -- become president. 

The issue is more than hypocrisy; it is allowing such stupid distractions to keep us from focusing on the real threats to our lives. Wretchard T Cat (Richard Fernandez) is on target:

The most astonishing thing is that nobody's hiding anything any more. The Russians are openly stealing information; Wikileaks is blatantly distributing it. America's enemies are opening fire, banners flying at American warships. The Obama administration is frankly buying the silence or quiescence of enemies with public money. At the same time he's got so many secret wars going on you can lose count. The Clintons have got a cash drop set up in the middle of Main Street.

The press is openly rooting for Hillary. Heck the UN wants her to win and isn't shy about saying so. ISIS is taking video, video of atrocities. It's like they don't care. It's like nobody cares. All pretense, all decorum are gone.

The only people who care are the GOP leaders who are shocked, shocked that candidates are using bad language. But they're like Temperance League biddies in saloon with a fight going on.

The whole spectacle is taking place in plain view and the most miraculous thing is that everyone pretends not to notice and keep drinking even while they dodge flying chairs and spittoons.

The show must go on. Whatever happens the show must go on.

David Gelernter argues we’ve become emasculated by the left in an article which I urge you all to read in its entirety, Here’s the money shot for his argument that Hillary must be stopped:

Trump voters have noticed that, not just over Mr. Obama’s term but in recent decades, their own opinions have grown increasingly irrelevant. It’s something you feel, like encroaching numbness. Since when has the American public endorsed affirmative action? Yet it’s a major factor in the lives of every student and many workers. Since when did we decide that men and women are interchangeable in hand-to-hand combat on the front lines? Why do we insist on women in combat but not in the NFL? Because we take football seriously. That’s no joke; it’s the sad truth.

Did we invite the federal bureaucracy to take charge of school bathrooms? I guess I missed that meeting. The schools are corrupt and the universities rotten to the core, and everyone has known it since the 1980s. But the Democrats are owned by the teachers unions, and Republicans have made only small-scale corrections to a system that needs to be ripped out and carefully disposed of, like poison ivy.

The Emasculated Voter to whom no one pays any attention is the story of modern democracy. Instead of putting voters in charge, we tell them they’re in charge, and it’s just as good. That’s the Establishment’s great discovery in the Lois Lerner Age.

Enter Mr. Trump. People say he became a star because he just happened to mention an issue that just happened to catch on. But immigration is the central issue of our time. Trump voters zeroed in because they saw what most intellectuals didn’t. What is our nation and what will it be? Will America go on being America or turn into something else? That depends on who lives here -- especially given our schools, which no longer condescend to teach Americanism. 

To reclaim your country and your virility -- assuming Nate Silver is right -- take all your male friends to the polls. It’s the least you can do for your country.

100659,1009,REPUBLICAN HEADQUARTERS IN NORTH CAROLINA FIREBOMBED; IS DEMOCRATS’ VIOLENT RHETORIC TO BLAME?,http://www.powerlineblog.com/archives/2016/10/republican-headquarters-in-north-carolina-firebombed-is-democrats-violent-rhetoric-to-blame.php,24,"Last night, the Republican Party headquarters in Orange County, North Carolina was firebombed, presumably by a group of Democrats:

Hillsborough police said somebody threw a bottle of flammable liquid through the window of Orange County’s GOP headquarters, setting supplies and furniture ablaze.

Fortunately, no one was injured or killed, apparently because the premises were unoccupied at the time of the attack. The fire gutted the Republican headquarters: It is rather ironic that Democrats have been wringing their hands over “violence” supposedly incited by Donald Trump, but, as happens in every election cycle, any actual violence is perpetrated by Democrats. Those who attacked the GOP headquarters left this spray-painted message on the wall of an adjacent building: So the firebombers had internalized the smears that prominent Democrats and Democratic journalists have leveled against Donald Trump and the GOP in this election cycle.

The firebombing probably was not committed by marginal, uneducated people. Orange County is the wealthiest county in North Carolina. It is heavily Democratic, with Democrats and independents outnumbering Republicans 5-1. The county is home to the University of North Carolina in Chapel Hill, and Duke University is just outside the county’s boundary. So left-wing students or professors could have been involved.

Democrats perpetrate this sort of violence in every election cycle. They should be caught and prosecuted to the fullest extent of the law. "
100660,1009,WHO’S DEPLORABLE?,http://www.powerlineblog.com/archives/2016/10/whos-deplorable-2.php,24,"One of the things that emerges clearly from the Wikileaks dump of John Podesta’s email chain, as noted here previously, is the utter contempt liberals have for “everyday Americans,” and their cherished institutions like the Catholic Church. The left has no problem discussing how they want to force the Catholic Church to change so as to conform to the current leftist party line.

But this Podesta email, posted right after the San Bernardino shooting last fall, is perhaps the most egregious yet: Remember this, next time you hear Hillary talk about Trump supporters being “deplorable.” Podesta’s brother, Tony, was the founding president of “People for the American Way,” one more example of a simple rule: take any liberal slogan, and you can safely assume it means exactly the opposite in practice."
100661,1009,"ASSAULT ON MOSUL BEGINS, PRESAGING ANOTHER DEFEAT FOR ISIS",http://www.powerlineblog.com/archives/2016/10/assault-on-mosul-begins-presaging-another-defeat-for-isis.php,24,"Iraqi forces have commenced an offensive to retake the city of Mosul, ISIS’s last main stronghold in Iraq. According to the Washington Post, the battle will be waged by tens of thousands of Iraqi troops, perhaps as many as 80,000.

The forces will consist of Kurdish peshmerga soldiers, Sunni tribal fighters, army, police, Shiite militias, and elite counterterrorism units. The U.S. will back their effort with air support and “advisers” on the ground.

The plan is for the Kurds to take the lead in the initial advance. As for the Shiite militias, they are are not authorized to enter Mosul, given fears about sectarian abuses in the majority Sunni city and how their advance would be perceived. We’ll see how that goes.

It seems almost certain that Mosul will fall. This will be a major defeat for ISIS. It was in Mosul, after all, that Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi announced the ISIS caliphate more than two years ago. Since then, ISIS has been driven from Tikrit, Ramadi, and Fallujah.

How quickly it will be driven from Mosul is unclear. Iraq’s prime minister has said the city will be liberated by the end of the year, but some doubt that this is possible.

Progress will be slow because ISIS has fortified its defenses of the city in recent months by erecting concrete blast walls, digging trenches, and setting booby traps and explosive devices. The fact that between 1.2 million and 1.8 million Iraqis are still in the city obviously will complicate the campaign.

Meanwhile in Syria, ISIS recently suffered an embarrassing set back. Its forces have fled from Dabiq.

If the name of this village sounds familiar, it’s because this was to have been the site of what the Post describes, based on ISIS dogma, as “an apocalyptic showdown between Christian and Muslim armies — an Islamic version of the battle of Armageddon that would herald the end of the world.”

Contrary to this vision, it was Muslim fighters — albeit backed by U.S. airstrikes — who confronted ISIS in Dabiq, causing its fighters to flee. Nor did the world end.

Not all of the ISIS related news is good, however. It’s well known that ISIS has become a substantial presence in Libya. Less known, perhaps, is its increasing success in the Sinai.

A few days ago, ISIS fighters attacked a military checkpoint in northern Sinai region, killing 12 Egyptian soldiers and wounding six more. According to the Post, Egypt’s Western allies are concerned about the regime’s ability to curb the Islamic State. Egyptian President Abdel-Fattah el-Sissi concedes that the war against ISIS in the Sinai Peninsula will be a long and difficult one.

It seems clear, then, that ISIS remains a force to be reckoned with in the Middle East and North Africa. In addition, it has demonstrated the ability to commit or incite major acts of terrorism in Western Europe and the U.S.

That capacity won’t disappear with the fall of Mosul and Raqqa or with the defeat of ISIS in other outposts such as the Sinai Peninsula. But I have to believe that with each humiliating defeat ISIS suffers, its ability to attract recruits and inspire potential terrorists diminishes."
100662,1010,Trump’s claim that polling places are ‘rigged’ is unsubstantiated and dangerous,https://thinkprogress.org/donald-trump-claims-polling-places-are-rigged-12ba70beb551#.6mz1ybl0s,24,"He’s hinted at it before, but on Sunday afternoon, Donald Trump came right out and said it_—_he thinks polling places are “rigged.”
 While state election systems are vulnerable to hacking, there’s no evidence there’s anything “rigged” happening at polling places. A law professor who spent years researching voter fraud found only 31 instances out of more than a billion votes cast. Iowa’s Republican Secretary of State uncovered zero cases of voter impersonation at the polls during a two-year investigation.
On Saturday, Ashby Law_—_an elections law firm that works with many Republican- and Republican-leaning clients_—_posted a tweetstorm aimed at dismissing concern about rigging at polling places. Nonetheless, Trump told attendees at a rally Saturday in New Hampshire, “We’re going to beat the rigged system; we’re going to beat the rigged election.”
Trump’s new strategy: suppress the vote
Voter ID laws are a common way Republican try to suppress the vote. Trump’s “rigged” rhetoric is another means toward that same end.
Days ago, the Wall Street Journal reported that as his standing in the polls erodes, Trump has decided to try and win by depressing turnout for Hillary Clinton. In particular, Trump and his surrogates have urged supporters to “make sure other people don’t come in and vote five times” in urban areas like Philadelphia that are strongly Democratic.
“And you got to watch your polling booths, because I hear too many stories about Pennsylvania,” Trump said at a rally in Manheim, Pennsylvania earlier this month. “Certain areas. I hear too many bad stories, and we can’t lose an election because of you know what I’m talking about.”
Trump’s unsubstantiated concerns about rigging at polling places aren’t shared by his running mate. Appearing on Face the Nation just hours before Trump posted his “rigged” tweet, Pence said, “We’ll respect the outcome of this election.” And on Saturday, House Speaker Paul Ryan (R-WI) said, through a spokesperson, that he “is fully confident the states will carry out this election with integrity.”
‘Pitchforks and torches time’
Trump’s attempt to delegitimize elections is dangerous. Rice University presidential historian Douglas Brinkley told the New York Times that Americans “haven’t seen it since 1860, this threat of delegitimizing the federal government, and Trump is trying to say our entire government is corrupt and the whole system is rigged.”
“That’s a secessionist, revolutionary motif,” he added. “That’s someone trying to topple the apple cart entirely.”
On Saturday, Trump surrogate and Milwaukee Sheriff David A. Clarke tweeted that since American institutions are “corrupt,” he thinks it’s “pitchforks and torches time.” During a town hall event in Iowa earlier this month, a Trump supporter told Pence she’s “scared” about voter fraud, adding:
“Our lives depend on this election. Our kids’ futures depends on this election. I will tell you, just for me _ and I don’t want this to happen _ but I will tell you for me personally, if Hillary Clinton gets in, I myself, I’m ready for a revolution, because we can’t have her in.”
A Boston Globe report published yesterday indicates how Trump’s “rigged” rhetoric could cause problems on November 8 and beyond. One Trump supporter the Globe spoke with, a 61-year-old carpenter named Steve Webb, said he planned to heed Trump’s call to monitor polling places on election day.
“I’ll look for… well, it’s called racial profiling. Mexicans. Syrians. People who can’t speak American,” he said. “I’m going to go right up behind them. I’ll do everything legally. I want to see if they are accountable. I’m not going to do anything illegal. I’m going to make them a little bit nervous.”
If Trump doesn’t accept the result of the election on November 8, it wouldn’t be the firstEven if the election passes without confrontations between voters and Trump supporters and Trump accepts the result, Julian Zelizer, a Princeton University presidential scholar, said Trump’s rhetoric will create problems for Clinton.
“If Clinton is elected, as it looks like she will be, they will be convinced she should not be president because the Republican nominee has confirmed their own fears, anxieties, and conspiratorial outlook,” Zelizer told the Globe. “It will make governing more difficult.” time. Following Mitt Romney’s loss to Barack Obama four years ago, Trump went on a Twitter rant that included a call to his supporters to “march on Washington.”"
100663,1010,Calls to sexual assault helplines spike in wake of Trump scandal,https://thinkprogress.org/trump-scandal-sparks-calls-to-rape-crisis-hotline-a41a69685866#.aanmucbe8,24,"The mounting sexual assault and harassment allegations against Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump have had an impact beyond news headlines and declining poll numbers: Women have been flooding the Rape, Abuse, and Incest National Network (RAINN) call center to seek help for their trauma.
RAINN’s live chat helpline has reportedly seen a 33 percent spike over the past week and calls to the telephone hotline are up 35 percent since news was reported of Trump openly discussed trying to bed a married woman, forcibly kissing beautiful women, and grabbing their genitals on a hot mic for Access Hollywood.
The recording has brought more attention to Trump’s history of sexual assault and harassment allegations, including at least one lawsuit filed by a former employee, Jill Harth. Harth’s 1997 complaint detailed multiple unwanted sexual advances from Trump including groping and kissing. Trump and his team have since gone on the offensive, denying the allegations and even going as far to say that the women accusing him and media are conspiring in a lie.
Sharp increases in crisis hotline activity, particularly from victims who have not yet reported the crimes to the police, have followed high-profile scandals in the past.
“The nature of those calls tend to be more emotional support; sometimes they have questions,” particularly regarding time limits on reporting an assault, RAINN’s President Scott Berkowitz told ABC.
News of scandals like Trump’s can be a trigger for assault victims, causing them to relive the trauma of their attacks as the accusations play out in the media. In addition, some Republicans’ continued support of Trump, along with his campaign characterizing his brags about sexual assault as just “talk,” have raised questions about how accusations of sexual assault against women are automatically dismissed. But the one good thing to come out of Trump’s scandal may be that some women are inspired to get help, and possibly justice, for their own assaults."
100664,1010,Trump says SNL parody is evidence of ‘rigged’ election,https://thinkprogress.org/donald-trump-saturday-night-live-rigged-d085f9772c11#.vzig0rdj1,24,"As his standing in the polls has eroded in recent weeks, Donald Trump and some of his surrogates have been pushing the idea that the election will be rigged.
Part of Trump’s case is that the media is allegedly rigging the election for Hillary Clinton. Trump argues the media concocted the 10 (and counting) sexual assault accusations brought against him since a tape of him bragging about forcibly kissing and groping women was released on October 7. Despite ample evidence to the contrary, Trump also argues stories that are helpful to him (such as the Wikileaks hacks) are being suppressed in favor of stories that aren’t (like the recording of him bragging about forcibly kissing and groping women).
This alleged conspiracy includes outlets like CNN, the New York Times, the Washington Post, and People magazine, among others. In Trump’s mind, it now also includes Saturday Night Live.
Last night, to nobody’s surprise, SNL aired a skit parodying the second presidential debate. Alec Baldwin, playing Trump, uncomfortably lurks behind Kate McKinnon’s Hillary Clinton, just as Trump actually did during the debate. Trump’s interest in girls is mocked_—_“I love kids. OK, I love them so much I marry them,” Baldwin’s Trump at one point says_—_as is Trump’s convenient belief that the women who have accused Bill Clinton of sexual misconduct should be taken seriously, while those accusing him should not.
Clinton isn’t portrayed in a flattering light either, with McKinnon mocking her for being stiff and rehearsed during the debate. Watch for yourself: While neither candidate was portrayed in a glowing light, Trump was upset about Baldwin’s performance. On Twitter, he cited it as yet another example of how the media is rigging the election against him. SNL lampooning public figures isn’t new to this election cycle, of course. And when Trump hosted the show less than a year ago, he had a very different reaction: It’s just another example of Trump’s legendary insecurity_—_insecurity that was apparently on display back when Trump hosted SNL in 2004. In recent months, Trump has retreated almost entirely to the protective cocoon of Fox News_—_he hardly ever makes appearances on other networks. He hasn’t held a press conference since July 27th. As the general election has heated up and scrutiny on him has intensified, Trump has increased the vitriol of his attacks against the media.
Weeks before the election, the man who seeks control of America’s nuclear arsenal apparently can’t sit through an SNL parody of himself without lashing out."
100665,1001,Daily Kos Elections 2016 forecast: Where should Clinton expand the map?,http://www.dailykos.com/stories/2016/10/17/1583418/-Daily-Kos-Elections-2016-forecast-Where-should-Clinton-expand-the-map#read-more,25,"Hillary Clinton’_s odds of winning the presidential race are nearly as high as the Harlem Globetrotters’ odds of winning their next matchup against the Washington Generals: currently 96 percent, according to the Daily Kos Elections model. That puts her in a similar position that Barack Obama was in, around this point in mid-October of 2008, where victory in the key swing states was no longer in doubt and the question became what other states, if any, to start pushing into.

The Washington Post_ reported on Sunday that the Clinton campaign is internally having that conversation now: whether to try to expand the map into red states, or redouble the efforts to lock down the current swing states and not let any of them inadvertently slip through the cracks. The _Post’s article also contains a third, related option, which is to turn the focus more to retaking Congress. While the money that’s specifically in the hands of the Clinton campaign can’t be redirected like that, Priorities USA (the main Super PAC that’s supporting Clinton) is signaling that they plan to start focusing on the pivotal Senate races in Nevada, New Hampshire, North Carolina, and Pennsylvania. (Priorities USA can’t coordinate with the Clinton campaign, so they’re doing that on their own.)

While moving money into the red states is definitely a gamble, the red states are, in a way, more vulnerable than the swing states. Many of the red states just don’t have the infrastructure in place that would help the Republicans defend them; in other words, the swing states are already heavily fortified, with campaign offices, staffers, voter files, and everything else you need to fight a house-to-house battle. But if one party punches through the front lines, there’s just not much in the way of resources in the seemingly safe states that would help the other party keep fighting on the new terrain as they fall back. (If you want a military metaphor, think of France after the elaborately designed Maginot Line was breached in World War II. There was nothing for them to fall back to, and it turned into a rout.)

You can see those parallels in the news stories suddenly springing up about how the Republicans are suddenly worried about losing Arizona. NBC reports that there is a total of five staffers in the state, paid for jointly by the Trump campaign, the RNC, and the Arizona state GOP. No TV or radio advertising from the Trump campaign has happened, and only a five-digit sum is allocated for mailers. The Clinton campaign has started sending surrogates to Arizona (for instance, Chelsea Clinton will speak there on Wednesday), though the real question is how much they start to spend on advertising there.

_So, instead of discussing the model by talking about the swing states like usual, let’s take a look at some of the red states, with an eye toward where, if anywhere, the Clinton campaign should expand to.

Arizona: Clinton 43.5, Trump 42.9 (+0.6) (36 percent odds of Democratic win)

Georgia_: Trump 45.4, Clinton 44.2 (- 1.2) (25 percent odds of Democratic win)

Missouri_: Trump 46.3, Clinton 42.3 (- 4.0) (3 percent odds of Democratic win)

South Carolina_:  Trump 47.4, Clinton 43.0 (- 6.4) (2 percent odds of Democratic win)

Mississippi:_ Trump 50.5,  Clinton 43.0 (- 7.5) (2 percent odds of Democratic win)
First, let’s start with the red states where our model gives Trump something less than 99 percent odds of winning. (We could also include North Carolina in there, since Mitt Romney did win it in 2012. However, the Tar Heel State is leaning in Clinton’s direction already; her polling aggregate there gives her a 2.8 percent lead, and 74 percent odds of winning.)

The first thing you might notice is something you haven’t seen in our model until this week (though it was something you could see in the Huffington Post Pollster aggregates for much of the first half of the year): Clinton has pulled narrowly ahead in the poll aggregate in Arizona. That isn’t showing up as greater than 50 percent odds in the model, though, since it’s both a new development, and there’s still a “fundamentals” component to the model that weights it down a bit. Nevertheless, it’s still definitely the Democrats’ best pickup opportunity after North Carolina.

Georgia is the next best option; Clinton trails only narrowly in the polling average there, and our model gives her a 25 percent chance of a win based on current polls. Like Arizona, the demographic trends are in our favor in Georgia; the non-white share of the population is rapidly growing (partly because of immigration, but, unique to Georgia, also because of a reverse Great Migration, with many northern African Americans moving to the Atlanta area in the most recent decade), while white voters in the metropolitan areas are disproportionately college-educated.

After that is Missouri, which is the only other state after North Carolina, Arizona, and Georgia that Mitt Romney won in 2012 but only by a single-digit margin (and keep in mind that John McCain won Missouri by only a fraction of a point in 2008, much closer than either Arizona or Georgia). However, unlike Arizona and Georgia, where we’ve seen many polls with Clinton ahead, we’ve only seen two polls all cycle with Clinton with a lead in Missouri, none since July and never with a lead of more than 2. Unfortunately, the demographic trend in Missouri is probably going the wrong way (which explains its loss of its bellwether status after being a key swing state for much of the 20th century); it has below-average education levels and once you get outside of the major metropolitan areas, it’s almost exclusively white.

Finally, the last two on the list might surprise you: South Carolina and Mississippi. You probably recall some recent South Carolina polls with Clinton trailing only by low single digits; Mississippi polls have been few and far between, but some of them have been close as well (in fact, Mason-Dixon saw a tied race, back in March). What these two states have in common is that they have the first and third highest percentage of African American residents of any states (37 in Mississippi, 28 in South Carolina). Any erosion among the white electorate when the black vote doesn’t erode (and in fact remains highly motivated and highly unified) means a closer race than we’re used to in these states.

There are, however, several other states that have a closer poll aggregate than South Carolina and Mississippi. South Carolina and Mississippi have slightly higher chances than those other states because they’ve had a very long-term, consistent polling pattern (again, thanks to the highly consistent black vote in those states), so they’re more locked-in on the model, while some of the other states, which we’ll discuss next, have only lately started to break in the Democrats’ direction.

Alaska_: Trump 41.6, Clinton 35.7 (- 5.9)

Texas_: Trump 45.7, Clinton 39.3 (- 6.4)

Indiana_: Trump 47.2, Clinton 40.7 (- 6.5)

Kansas_: Trump 47.8, Clinton 38.1 (- 9.7)
These are the states where Clinton has a <1 percent chance of winning according to the model, but where the poll aggregates find the race within single-digits. I’ll bet you wouldn’t have thought of Alaska as the best shot outside of the Arizona/Georgia/Missouri trio, but it is. That shouldn’t be that surprising, though; it was one of the few states where Obama fared better in 2012 (losing by 14 points) than in 2008 (losing by 19 points), and it’s also one of the most diverse red states (at 64 percent non-Hispanic white). On top of that, Gary Johnson is polling well here, and that seems to be coming disproportionately out of the GOP side.

Following that is Texas, truly the big enchilada here, with 38 electoral votes, and with a huge Hispanic population. The unfortunate flip-side, though, is that Texas is ridiculously expensive to do anything in, thanks to multiple expensive media markets. A million dollars to spend in Alaska would be a potential game-changer this year … while a million dollars in Texas would basically just be a burp in the wind. On the other hand, from a long-term perspective, if there’s one state to try and start building a foothold in, it’s Texas. If the Dems can transform Texas into a swing state on an ongoing basis, that would make it infinitely more difficult for the Republicans to win future presidential races.

Finally, there are two Midwestern states: Indiana and Kansas. While Barack Obama narrowly won Indiana in 2008 (perhaps gambling that he was already well-known there, at least in the portion that’s served by the Chicago media market), he didn’t play there at all in 2012 and the addition of Mike Pence to the GOP ticket had people assuming that it wouldn’t be within reach this year. However, Pence wasn’t that popular to begin with (he was possibly on track to lose his re-election, if he’d stuck around in Indiana), and as Trump becomes more toxic, polls have recently shown things getting interesting in Indiana, including a Monmouth poll from this week that had the race within 4 points.

And Kansas is another very remote possibility, at the far edge of the single digits. It’s possible that some of the unpopularity of Gov. Sam Brownback is rubbing off on all other Republicans, but really what’s happening is that one-quarter of Kansas’s population, the part that’s in KS-03, is peak Never Trump territory. The affluent, college-educated residents of the Kansas City metro area are disproportionately on the Kansas side of the border rather than the Missouri side, in Johnson County. Polls of KS-03 show not only a close House race there, but also show Clinton way ahead in the district, enough to bring the state as a whole within single digits.

South Dakota_: Trump 52.0, Clinton 41.0 (- 11.0)

Montana_: Trump 48.8, Clinton 36.8 (- 12.0)

Utah_: Trump 41.1, Clinton 28.8 (- 12.3)

North Dakota_: Trump 51.7, Clinton 34.0 (-17.7)
Finally, let’s look at some states that not only give Clinton less than a 1 percent chance of winning but _aren’t_ that close in the polling aggregate, either, just for comparison purposes. You might recall that in 2008, the two states where Obama made a play very late in the game were Montana and North Dakota. It didn’t quite work … he lost Montana by 2 points and North Dakota by 8 points. Well, there’s not much basis for trying there this year; our polling aggregates put Clinton down by double digits in both states. (In fact, South Dakota presents a slightly better option than either of them this year, though not as good as Kansas.) Montana and North Dakota have considerably more Native Americans than most other states, but in terms of a minority vote, that’s about it; they’re both about 90 percent white overall, without large college-educated populations.

And then there’s Utah, which has gotten a lot of hype in the media, and even in the campaigns, as being close. (The Clinton campaign has made a show of sending surrogates there, for instance.) Our model, however, just isn’t seeing it. Yes, there are occasionally polls that find a close or even tied race (including one this week, from Y2 Analytics), but for every poll like that, there are several more that have a double-digit Trump lead. (Somehow those polls don’t get the same hype from the media.) Perhaps the theory is that independent candidate Evan McMullin will split the GOP vote here, but really what seems to be happening is that the late surge of interest in McMullin is also coming out of the state’s Never Trump camp, instead splitting the people who weren’t going to vote for Trump anyway (though perhaps that hurts Gary Johnson more than Clinton).

Here’s a final thought: maybe the criteria for which red states to expand into shouldn’t have so much to do with how close they are, but instead what else_ is on the ballot there? As I’ve argued before, you don’t really get a bonus, in terms of implementing your agenda, for having more electoral votes; they’re helpful for claiming a “mandate,” but a mandate and two dollars will get you a cup of coffee if you don’t control both chambers of Congress. So which of these red states have important down-ballot races?

Arizona_: AZ-Sen (Likely R), AZ-01 (Tossup), AZ-02 (Likely R)

Missouri_: MO-Sen (Lean R), MO-Gov (Tossup)

Alaska_: AK-AL (Likely R)

Texas_: TX-23 (Tossup)

Indiana_: IN-Sen (Tossup), IN-Gov (Tossup), IN-02 (Likely R), IN-09 (Likely R)

Kansas_: KS-03 (Lean R)

Montana_: MT-Gov (Lean D), MT-AL (Likely R)
In terms of key Tossup races, Indiana may well be the most important one here; both its Senate and gubernatorial races are open seats, and fall in that category. (Evan Bayh is trying to get his old seat back in the Senate, while John Gregg, who narrowly lost to Mike Pence in 2012’s governor’s race, is trying again, this time against GOP Lt. Gov. Eric Holcomb.) Missouri also has both a key Senate race and a key gubernatorial race. That may be an added incentive to make a big presidential push in those states, in the hopes of generating some coattails, even if they aren’t as close as Arizona and Georgia. (And Arizona, too, has a Senate race, though it’s barely competitive at this point. The open seat race in AZ-01 may be the big fight to watch in that state.)

Speaking of the Senate, let’s turn briefly to the Senate model before we go. The model has been essentially stable for nearly a month now, in the 55 to 60 percent range; today it’s at 57 percent. Below the surface, there’s a lot of volatility, but it’s all managed to cancel itself out in the end. The odds in Indiana and Wisconsin have both fallen a bit this week, in the wake of so-so polls in both of those races (which were in low single-digits, after seeing a lot of double-digit leads earlier in the cycle); Evan Bayh’s chances in Indiana are now 82 percent and Russ Feingold’s are 84 percent. This means, for the first time all year, Tammy Duckworth is now the likeliest person to pick up a Senate seat (she’s currently at 95 percent odds in Illinois).

On the plus side, though, in Nevada, Catherine Cortez Masto has moved into a lead for the first time since we launched the model (54 percent odds, though Joe Heck has a paper-thin 42.3-42.1 lead in the polling aggregate). It’s unclear whether the Nevada Dems’ vaunted GOTV machine has finally kicked in, or if Heck is suffering among Republican voters for having disavowed Donald Trump … it’s probably a little of each, but either way, with Nevada potentially the pivotal seat for reaching 50 in the Senate, our increasing odds there compensate for the small decline in Indiana and Wisconsin.

UPDATE: I’m just going to assume it was because Hillary Clinton found this article and it spurred her to action, but on Monday morning, the Clinton campaign announced its first forays into the red states. They’ll be spending $2 million on TV and digital ads in Arizona (and lead off with a Michelle Obama visit on Thursday); they’re also spending $1 million on Missouri and Indiana from the Hillary Victory Fund (which is an entity separate from the campaign, designed for passing max-out-donor money through to the state parties). Most impressively, the campaign is also launching a one-week ad buy in Texas, highlighting her endorsements from newspapers in the Lone Star State."
100666,1001,Trump's 'rigged election' meme and GOP voter ID laws have the same goal: Stopping black votes,http://www.dailykos.com/stories/2016/10/17/1583566/-Trump-s-rigged-election-meme-is-aimed-at-the-same-place-as-GOP-voter-ID-laws-stopping-black-votes,25,"While Donald Trump has been increasing his use of the rigged election theme in his speeches and tweets, his favorite surrogate has also been on the air feeding every right-wing stereotype and conspiracy theory.

Top Donald Trump adviser Rudy Giuliani claimed Sunday that Democrats could steal a close election by having dead people vote in inner cities …

""I'm sorry, dead people generally vote for Democrats rather than Republicans,"" the former New York City mayor told CNN's Jake Tapper on ""State of the Union."" ""You want me to (say) that I think the election in Philadelphia and Chicago is going to be fair? I would have to be a moron to say that.""
He’d have to be a moron? Well, that certainly means there are no barriers between Rudy and saying anything at all. But why is Giuliani focusing on these cities, especially when Chicago is in a state where Clinton enjoys a massive lead?

Giuliani said as a prosecutor, he remembers an election in Chicago in which 720 supposedly dead people voted -- and that 60 dead people cast ballots in his own mayor's race. …

He also said that only Democrats do it, because it happens in inner cities.
“Inner cities,” meaning black people, of course. Because what Rudy Giuliani means here is black people are cheaters.

The Election Protection Coalition is mobilizing thousands of volunteers to help Americans navigate the voting process—overcoming difficult roadblocks and dangerous conservative voter suppression tactics. Sign up today to help make sure all Americans have a chance to vote.

Guiliani’s “inner city”—the place that Donald Trump continually calls out as being a no jobs, no future, violence-filled hell on earth and the home of all black people—is also the focus of the places Trump is sending his red shirts to watch the polls.

Saying Trump merely ""suggested"" voter fraud is rampant in Pennsylvania is an understatement. The Republican presidential nominee has said flatly that if he doesn't win the key battleground state, it's because of cheating.

The idea of political operatives scouring polling sites to prevent — at least as Trump puts it — nearly inevitable foul play may sound frighteningly vague, but his campaign is leveraging his comments more precisely: A form on Trump's website recruits volunteers to become poll watchers and ""stop crooked Hillary from rigging this election.""
These poll watchers could challenge any voter they like, dragging the voting process at polling stations overrun with Trump “watchers” to a halt. And while some Republican lawmakers may be pretending to be offended by what Trump is saying, the truth is Republican lawmakers are working to make it easier for the red shirts to stop voters.

Poll watchers currently must live in the county in which they operate, but new legislation could change that. House Bill 29 would allow watchers to volunteer in any county in the state, as long as they're Pennsylvania residents.

The bill currently is in the House Appropriations Committee and is written so that it would take effect immediately if passed when the House reconvenes later in October. 
Passing this legislation would mean that Trump supporters could come in from rural areas and challenge voters dozens or hundreds of miles from where they live. Republicans are using the presence of three Black Panther members outside a single polling station in 2008 as the justification of the bill, but the Republican legislation allows watchers from distant areas to come inside the polling place to challenge voters.

The idea that there is voter fraud in Philadelphia isn’t an idea that originated with Trump. Republicans have been pushing this idea for years without evidence.

The idea that Democrats steal elections in Pennsylvania via Philadelphia is one that Trump has promoted and is hardly a new accusation. During a Trump event in August in Altoona, U.S. Rep. Bill Shuster, a Republican who represents a large portion of Southwest Pennsylvania, spoke about overcoming ""what goes on down in Philadelphia.""

""The cheating, what they do – we've got to make sure we're doing the job here in central Pennsylvania,"" Shuster said, according to the Washington Post
Republicans have resisted efforts to address genuine issues with the Pennsylvania voting laws. Instead, they passed a voter ID law in 2012 that was struck down as unconstitutional.

The judge … ruled that the law hampered the ability of hundreds of thousands of Pennsylvanians to cast their ballots, with the burden falling most heavily on elderly, disabled and low-income residents, and that the state’s reason for the law — that it was needed to combat voter fraud — was not supported by the facts.
But with Trump building his case for “massive voter fraud,” Republicans are hurrying to help him.

When Trump suggests that Pennsylvania may be stolen, ""all of sudden it kicks into gear that there's going to be massive cheating, massive fraud, enough to swing an election,"" something Thornburgh said is ""not based on anything other than Donald Trump.""
Not based on anything other than Donald Trump. And on Rudy Giuliani. And on decades of Republican efforts to create a pretense of voter fraud in order to justify restrictive voter ID legislation. Because just like Trump’s rigged election talk, voter ID laws are designed to see fewer people voting. Especially fewer minority people.

Don’t be mistaken when Donald Trump talks about voter fraud. He means fraud in the “inner cities.” He means black people are trying to stop his campaign. And of course he’s right. They are—by voting fairly, and hopefully unhampered by the red shirts Trump is dispatching to throw a monkey wrench into democracy."
100667,1001,Clinton camp eyes Arizona among other places to expand the map for Democrats,http://www.dailykos.com/stories/2016/10/17/1583558/-Clinton-camp-eyes-Arizona-among-other-places-to-expand-the-map-for-Democrats,25,"While promising to keep an eye on the main battleground states, the Clinton campaign is beginning to invest in areas that could both expand the electoral map and tip the balance toward Democrats in down-ballot races. 

On a call with reporters Monday, Clinton campaign manager Robby Mook mentioned Arizona in particular when given the opportunity to name states of interest outside the main battlegrounds.

“We do see opportunity in Arizona,"" he said, even as he emphasized that reaching 270 electoral votes was their chief concern. The campaign plans to pump $6 million into Ohio, Florida, Pennsylvania, Nevada, North Carolina, Iowa, and New Hampshire—all of which feature critical down-ballot races. 

Mook said the campaign would be dropping an additional $2 million in Arizona. First Lady Michelle Obama is also being deployed to campaign there on Thursday.   

In addition, Mook noted the campaign was investing $1 million in Indiana and Missouri, where he acknowledged Clinton's chances of prevailing were slim, suggesting the chief goal there is influencing down-ballot races.

North Carolina remains on the “front lines” of this campaign, he added, saying they “expect to win” the Tar Heel State but by a “razor-thin” margin."
100668,1002,"The campaign spokesman for Donald J. Trump released a statement Monday afternoon demanding that Under Secretary of State for Management Patrick Kennedy resign after a public release of FBI interview summaries, which included a description of a deal with the FBI that Kennedy proposed.",http://www.breitbart.com/2016-presidential-race/2016/10/17/trump-campaign-state-dept-patrick-kennedy-must-resign-after-asking-fbi-to-help-him-bury-requested-benghazi-docs/,25,"“Today’s release of the FBI notes on their investigation into Clinton’s secret email server is deeply disturbing,” said Trump senior spokesman Jason Miller.

Video: FBI, DHS: Homegrown Attacks an Increasing Threat

“The news that top Clinton aide Patrick Kennedy tried to engage in a blatant quid pro quo for changing the classification level of several of Clinton’s emails shows a cavalier attitude towards protecting our nation’s secrets. Kennedy must resign from the State Department immediately and Clinton must state he has no place in her administration if she is elected President,” he said.

Kennedy’s behavior came to light with the FBI’s release Monday of more “302” summaries from its interviews relating to Secretary of State Hillary R. Clinton’s private email account and server scheme. The summaries, typed up on FD-302 forms, are the only records of FBI interviews. FBI interviews are not recorded nor videotaped, and the 302’s are typed up after the interview.

In one interview conducted July 30, 2015, the FBI interviewed [redacted], who worked at the FBI’s Records Management Division, Winchester, Virginia.

The individual told the FBI that he received a call from the bureau’s International Operations Division, who pressured him to change the classification of an email from classified to unclassified, according to the 302 summary. The caller said that Patrick Kennedy had called him to offer an quid pro quo.

Kennedy offered the International Operations Division a deal, according to the interview notes. In exchange for declassifying the email, Kennedy would lift restrictions preventing the FBI from sending agents to countries where the State Department forbade the FBI.

Soon after the conversation, the man interviewed told the FBI that he was in a meeting presided over by Kennedy with representatives from Central Intelligence Agency, Defense Intelligence Agency, and other agencies. At one point in the meeting, which was called to address the issue of Clinton’s handling of sensitive electronic correspondence, someone asked Kennedy if any of the emails Clinton handled on her private email arrangement were classified.

Before Kennedy answered, he made eye contact with the interviewee and then said: “Well, we’ll see.”

The interviewee told the FBI that he felt Kennedy was making a direct reference to his proposed swap.

In another interview conducted Sept. 30,2015, the FBI spoke to [redacted], a retired official at the International Operations Division who told the agents that in May or June of 2015, he found a note that Kennedy was trying to reach him.

This retired IOD official said it was surprising because he and his top aides had been trying to reach Kennedy for months.

When the retired IOD official reached Kennedy, the undersecretary had a request about classification–this time, he wanted IOD to classify an email dealing with the Sept. 11, 2012 attacks on American personnel and facilities at Benghazi, Libya.

Kennedy’s ask was for IOD to re-class the email at B9, which the agent’s note says could make the document exempt from Freedom of Information Act requests.

The IOD interviewee told the FBI: “Kennedy further stated that the B9 classification would allow him to archive the document in the basement of the State Department never to be seen again.”

After a conversation with the bureau’s Counterterrorism Division, who had originally classified the email, IOD told Kennedy they would not meet his demand.

Miller said Kennedy was exposed disrespecting national security.

Not only should Kennedy, a career Foreign Service Officer, resign; Trump’s Democratic rival must commit that he will not return to government service, if she is elected president, he said."
100669,1002,"With Democrat nominee Hillary Clinton up double digits in only one poll on the RealClearPolitics average of polls, close to or within the margin of error in several more, and GOP nominee Donald Trump up between one and seven points in still a few more, it is apparent that this race is still a close fought contest in this second week of October.",http://www.breitbart.com/big-government/2016/10/17/polls-show-race-remains-close-multiple-states/,25,"In Ohio, for instance, Quinnipiac has a poll taken in the second week of October showing Clinton and Trump in a tie in a four way race with the Libertarian and Green Party candidates, the latter tow in at six and one percent respectively. With a margin of error 3.9 percent Ohio could swing either way for Quinnipiac.

For the same period in Ohio, the RealClearPolitics average has Trump up 0.7. Over the same week, Emerson has Clinton up two, NBC/WSJ/Marist has Trump up one, and CNN/ORC has Trump up four.

But where Clinton is leading she is often within the margin of error or close to it. In Florida, Quinnipiac has Clinton up four with a margin of error (MOE) 3.9, making the race a statistical tie. CNN/ORC has Nevada at Clinton plus two with an MOE of 3.5. And in Colorado, Quinnipiac has Trump up eight with a 3.7 MOE.

As to the states Trump is leading in for the second week of October, CNN/ORC has Trump up four in Ohio with a 3.9 MOE, JMC Analytics has Trump up seven in Louisiana with a 3.5 MOE, and Rasmussen has Trump up one in Utah with an MOE of four.

This past August, Hillary Clinton raised $18 million on a three-day trip through California, or roughly $270,000 an hour, as she mingled with Hall of Fame basketball player Magic Johnson, Apple CEO Tim Cook, performer Justin Timberlake and several of the Golden States most affluent families, according to the Associated Press.

The Times also notes that former presidential candidate and former Maryland Gov. Martin O’Malley will headline an October 28 fundraiser in Studio City, which is being promoted as “the last official HRC event in Los Angeles.”

O’Malley will reportedly perform on his guitar. Tickets to attend are $1,000 per guest and $2,700 to take a photo with O’Malley.

According to a study released by the Center for Public Integrity, approximately $382,000 was given to Clinton by members of the news media and journalists through August. In comparison, the same study found that approximately 50 identifiable journalists gave roughly $14,000 to the Trump campaign combined."
100671,1003,The Snow White Election,http://www.huffingtonpost.com/robert-s-mcelvaine/the-snow-white-election_b_12516696.html?utm_hp_ref=politics,25,"It is clear that the first presidential election in which a woman is a major party nominee has brought to the fore deep-seated issues of male insecurity and concerns about the decline of traditional gender roles. Such problems are exacerbated in periods of economic uncertainty, as they were during the Great Depression. Walt Disney’s classic 1937 feature-length color animation, Snow White and Seven Dwarfs, speaks to us from that era in a way that can provide key insights into the 2016 Election.

The anxiety of many males in the Depression Era is echoed by a large portion of the male electorate in the 2016 election. Donald Trump represents the hope of working-class white men for a restoration of what they believe to be proper roles for men and women. Much of Trump’s support comes from men who fit the description Franklin D. Roosevelt made of Depression victims in 1932: “the forgotten man at the bottom of the economic pyramid.” They believe that Trump is remembering them. A Washington Post/ABC News poll taken just before the first presidential debate found that white men without a college degree favor Trump over Hillary Clinton by an astonishing 59 point margin (76 percent to 17 percent). That is about twice the margin (31 points) by which Mitt Romney won white, non-college-degree men over a black male opponent four years ago. The same poll found college-educated white women going for Clinton 57-32.

Acute Masculine Insecurity Disorder

Mr. Trump shares with many of his white male supporters an obvious insecurity about his “manhood.” The candidate’s bragging before a national television audience about the size of his male organ and writing, “my fingers are long and beautiful, as, it has been well documented, are various other parts of my body,” his love for such “strong man” leaders as Vladimir Putin, his decision to release his putative testosterone level as one of the few bits of information about his health that he would reveal to voters, and his braggadocio about groping women are just a few of the many indications that Trump suffers from an affliction that is not listed in the American Psychiatric Association’s Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, but has caused more harm throughout human history than any other psychological disorder. I call it “Acute Masculine Insecurity Disorder” (AMID).

That malady was widespread among men during the economic cataclysm of the 1930s. The traditional male role of provider was undercut, leaving numerous men feeling emasculated. In many cases, women had jobs while their husbands were unemployed. That circumstance produced a tangible longing to reestablish the putative “natural” order of male authority and female dependence, which was reflected in the decade’s popular culture. The song “Remember My Forgotten Man” from the movie Gold Diggers of 1933, captured this yearning perfectly. Joan Blondell makes a woman’s call for a return of men to their traditional position: “I was happy then / He used to take care of me / Won’t you bring him back again? / ‘Cause ever since the world began / A woman’s got to have a man.”

Disney’s characters Snow White and the Wicked Queen present the same message a bit more subtly. The movie is a thinly veiled warning about what happens when women get out of their “place” by obtaining power—and a demand for the restoration of male dominance and female subordination. The Wicked Queen is as much the personification of the evil that will supposedly result from a woman escaping male control and gaining power as is Agave in Euripides’ The  Bacchae (405 BCE) The message is that power causes women to go insane and become absolutely evil. The Disney cartoon also provides its vision of the ideal female: a totally naïve, beautiful young woman who embodies the characteristics of the nineteenth-century vision of “true womanhood” (domesticity, submissiveness, purity, and piety), is so gullible that she takes a poisoned apple from a con woman after she has been strongly warned (“Now, don’t forget, my dear. The old queen’s a sly one—full of witchcraft. So beware of strangers.”), and lies comatose until revived and carried off to live “happily ever after” by a heroic man.

Grumpy gives voice to the Disney (and Trump-backer) view of women when he proclaims of Snow White: “She’s a female! And all females is poison! They’re full of wicked wiles!” Asked by a fellow dwarf what wicked wiles are, Grumpy answers, “I don’t know, but I’m agin’ ‘em.”

It is obvious that if the Disney-intended message of Snow White is applied to the current election, Hillary Clinton is the powerful woman full of wicked wiles blending mummy dust, the black of night, an old hag’s cackle, a scream of fright, a blast of wind and a thunderbolt into her witch’s brew. Trump never misses an opportunity to say as much, and it is plain that most of his male followers fully believe it and view the Democratic nominee as a witch—though they prefer to alter the word’s first letter.

Trump as the Wicked Queen

But Disney’s misogynist preachment from eight decades ago actually carries a different—though unintended—message for us this year:

It is Donald Trump who is the Wicked Queen.

He’s the one who found a recipe for a poisoned apple: “One taste of the poisoned apple, and the victim’s eyes will close forever in the sleeping death.” Then he presented it to the American people and it closed the eyes of those who bit into it.

“This is no ordinary apple,” Trump in effect says as he offers his promises to fix everything. “It’s a magic wishing apple.” “A wishing apple?” his credulous listeners eagerly respond.

“Yes! One bite and all your dreams will come true!” the con man tells his marks: “I will give you everything. I will give you what you’ve been looking for for 50 years. I’m the only one.”

“The crime and violence that today afflicts our nation will soon—and I mean very soon—come to an end.”

I’ll repeal Obamacare “and replace [it] with something terrific.“

“I know more about ISIS than the generals do. Believe me.” “I have a foolproof way of winning the war with ISIS.” “ISIS will be gone if I’m elected president. And they’ll be gone quickly.”

“If you do this one simple thing, you can deliver justice for every single person who has been wronged by the system. . . . Millions of jobs are going to come pouring back into our country. . . . and I’m gonna bring back safe neighborhoods.”

“Really?” Wicked Queen Trump’s dupes (most of whom have “skin white as snow”) giggle excitedly.

“Yes, girlie!—uh, I mean Americans. [sotto voce: You naïve fools! Suckers!] Now make a wish and take a bite, heh, heh.”

“Trust me!” “Believe me!” “It will be incredible—totally unbelievable!”

It is entirely understandable that struggling working-class Americans who have been left out by an economy that has produced vast wealth for people like Donald Trump yearn for a savior who can perform magic that will instantly solve all their problems. But the Wicked Queen dressed in an unbuttoned suit jacket and oversized tie encouraging them to bite his magic wishing apple is the opposite of a savior. The bright shiny exterior of the apple covers what is beneath its skin, which has the same initials as “bright shiny.” Those who bite that wishing apple are affirming that they have no more sense than the Disney version of Snow White.

If, between now and Election Day, any sizable number of non-college-educated white men awaken from the sleeping death into which taking a bite from Trump’s poisoned wishing apple put them and see that he has been playing them for fools on the level of Disney’s Snow White, Hillary Clinton’s victory will become a landslide of historic proportions."
100672,1003,"As ‘Brand’ Replaces Reputation, Democracy Goes To Hell",http://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/as-brand-replaces-reputation-democracy-goes-to-hell_us_5803ff21e4b06f314afeb6d7?utm_hp_ref=politics,25,"There’s one question that has so far gone unasked during any of the thousands of interviews with Donald Trump’s surrogates or spokespeople, but during each one, it’s the elephant in the room:

What is wrong with you?

How can any educated, rational, moral person be willing to lie so flagrantly, on behalf of a grotesquely unworthy candidate for the most important job in the world?

The question goes unasked, of course, because it would violate the norms of civil discourse, on which democracy depends.

The trouble is, Trumpists are happy to violate those norms, knowing they have their interlocutors in a bind: Responsible journalists can only respond with the facts. But if you don’t care about facts — if you deny them when they’re played for you on video — there’s nothing to constrain you from saying anything.

As Josh Barro tweeted recently, “Trump’s people lie and lie and lie and lie and lie and they don’t even respect us enough to lie well.” 

How did we get here? We’ve always had dishonesty in politics, but how did we get to this point of utter shamelessness?

KellyAnne Conway, Jason Miller, Rudy Giuliani, Newt Gingrich, and the rest all appear to be rational people. They have to know that they will carry the stink of this campaign for the rest of their lives. Whether Trump loses or (incredibly) wins, their reputations are destroyed.

Ah. That’s it. Reputations don’t matter any more.

We’ve replaced them with “brands.”

And nothing destroys a brand, as long as it keeps selling.

Newt Gingrich, for example, didn’t need the Trump campaign’s help to destroy his reputation. He long since did that himself. And yet he still gets booked all over cable TV, still gets paid to speak, still runs profitable scams.

His brand still sells.

When reputation mattered, it was a brake on perfidy. The fear of public shaming would cause even the most mendacious public figures to modulate their behavior.

Now, shame is a monetizable commodity: just ask any celebrity who’s traveled the well-worn circuit of fame — humiliation — more fame.

You can’t threaten a Trumpist with shame, because they’re wearing the reputational equivalent of suicide vests. Just like terrorists believe they’ll live on in paradise, Conway, Gingrich, and the rest believe — with reason — they’ll live on in media.

We sophisticated moderns may be rediscovering, through its absence, the value of the archaic concept of honor. To the signers of the Declaration of Independence, honor was “sacred.” To us, it seems quaint.

But what if we brought it back? Not exactly the old version, which was often tied to assumptions about class, gender, race, and censorship that we’ve rightly left behind, but one rooted in a basic reverence for democracy?

Journalists often say of KellyAnne Conway that, despite the flagrant dishonesty, she’s “a professional,” or a “good person.” I understand the desire to preserve standards of civil discourse. But Conway and her colleagues are exploiting those standards, and in so doing they’re undermining democracy.

They’re behaving dishonorably. Even in — or especially in — the most democratic society, there should be a cost for that."

Kansas’ governor, three members of Congress, and the secretary of state are urging Kansans to support Trump.

Historically, Kansas has been a Republican red state and loyalty to the party is a predictable indicator of Kansans’ behavior under almost all national and international contingencies. Party loyalty is a commendable value but democratic politics also need flexibility.

Of course, not everyone in Kansas favors Trump but the anti-Trump minority does not define Kansas political attitudes. And voting for Clintons is rarely an act of virtue. Yet what is at stake is intelligent politics. For state offices, Kansans are much more open in ditching party loyalties and assessing politicians on the basis of their individual strengths and weaknesses. This is the intelligent political attitude of an open-minded electorate.

With respect to national politics, however, Kansas leans on a solidified psychology rooted in patriotism, nativism, anti-urbanism, and primal individual libertarianism derived from harsh memories of the early settlers’ code of behavior. This form of rigid social psychology breeds stubborn self-confidence and cultivates little self-skepticism, a prerequisite for self-transformation and learning more nuanced behaviors. (I detected a similar mindset in Pakistan where I spent the first part of my life.)

The Kansas secretary of state, a presumably enlightened man who studied at Oxford University and Yale Law School, continues to exhibit small-minded nativism and a militant mindset that wishes to exclude immigrants (mostly brown people) from voting booths. He takes pride in co-fathering laws in Arizona and other states designed to curb illegal immigration. In Kansas, he promotes himself as a Trump-style birther denying the right to vote to nearly 20,000 Kansans who cannot produce birth certificates or proof of citizenship. State and federal courts have rebuffed the legal logic of his anti-suffrage pugnacity but he remains defiant and unteachable. An African-American federal judge in Kansas came close to holding him in contempt of court.

In 2013, the Kansas Board of Regents made headlines when it modified policies regarding academic freedom after a professor posted an anti-NRA tweet. Universities are safe places for open and vigorous exchange of ideas and viewpoints. Bold and intellectually-vibrant teachers are the lifeline of schools and universities while teaching dead ideas is the death of education. Ignoring these elementary truths about education, the Board is determined to align itself with the broader rigid psychology that scoffs at criticism. “Don’t rock the boat” is the mindset that defines the Kansas elites and the boat they have in mind is so fragile that even a small rocking is taken as an unforgivable assault.

This form of rigid social psychology breeds stubborn self-confidence and cultivates little self-skepticism, a prerequisite for self-transformation and learning more nuanced behaviors.
The state legislature has assaulted the freedom of Kansas judiciary that stands out as a beacon of hope in otherwise cheerless times in Kansas. After the Kansas Supreme Court took a firm stand to uphold the state constitution and required the legislature to allocate adequate funds for public education, the state senate moved a bill to make it easier to intimidate and impeach high court judges. In the forthcoming 2016 elections, some high court judges, though rated highly by lawyers, face backlash as politicians fan the fires of revulsion against their court opinions. How can anyone be safe in a state where judges of the highest court are willfully disrespected by the legislature?

When state officials promote dogmatic nativism and hatred, the bigoted people are emboldened to carry out their violent fantasies. In 2012, I cautioned the state legislature to tone down vile rhetoric against Kansas Muslims, who serve as engineers, physicians, and in businesses, and Muslim foreign students who study at local universities. A few days ago, the FBI arrested three Kansan white males in Garden City, located in the western part of the state, where large immigrant communities from Vietnam and Somalia live and work for local businesses. These hate-filled self-proclaimed “Crusaders” were planning to go house to house to kill Somalis (black and Muslim), living quiet lives and providing the needed manual labor for local businesses. I have yet to see the state governor to issue a strong statement that such barbarity will not be tolerated in Kansas, once upon a time a free state that dared to be different in a territorial neighborhood that practiced and defended slavery."
100674,1004,Trump Foundation Ceases Fundraising But Needs More Time Filing Paperwork,http://talkingpointsmemo.com/livewire/trump-foundation-ceases-fundraising-but-needs-more-time-filing-paperwork,25,"The New York Attorney General's office Monday said that the Donald J. Trump Foundation has informed the state that it had ceased fundraising – in compliance with an order issued by the state last month – but would need more time to file paperwork detailing the money it solicited in the state, the Washington Post reported.

The attorney general's office issued the order after it was found that the foundation had been raising outside money without being properly registered to do so under state law. A broader investigation is underway by New York Attorney General Eric Schneiderman after reports that the foundation engaged in other activities that appeared to be in violation of state charity law.

A spokesman for Schneiderman would not comment on the timeframe of the extension, or whether the new deadline would be before or after the election. In the letter sent Sept. 30, the agency requested the foundation submit annual financial reports for every year it was fundraising outside money without the proper certification, which, according to a Washington Post report, it has done for at least the last decade.

Had the foundation been properly registered to solicit outside donations, it would have been required to undergo annual audits by an independent auditor, who would have maybe noticed the other activities the foundation has engaged in over the years that are now being raised as possible legal violations. Among other things, it appears Trump used foundation money for transactions known as self-dealing, for instance settling legal matters or buying self-portraits that benefitted him or his businesses, rather than the charity. Self-dealing is a major no-no in the charity world, and legal experts say its rare to see a foundation engaged in such acts as frequently and blatantly as Trump's did."
100675,1004,David Duke Campaign Fundraising Letter Praises Trump For Embracing His ‘Issues’,http://talkingpointsmemo.com/livewire/david-duke-fundraising-letter-support-trump-louisiana-senate,25,"Former Ku Klux Klan leader and current Louisiana senate candidate David Duke sent out a fundraising letter last week urging residents to support a Duke-Donald Trump ticket on Election Day.

In a copy of the mailer sent to TPM, the white nationalist leader claims that Trump has elevated many of the issues that made him a national figure in the 1990s, from “stopping immigration, fair trade not free trade, and America First.”

“Thank God Trump has emerged and embraced my issues,” Duke writes in the letter, which was first sent out on Oct. 6 and flagged by the Huffington Post. The former KKK imperial wizard and one-term Louisiana state representative framed himself and Trump as two outspoken politicians unfairly targeted by the media for their unorthodox views.

“The media has raked me over the coals, targeted me, lied endlessly about me, but I have never given up,"" Duke wrote in the mailer. ""I’m still standing, still fighting, and I remain unbroken.""

Duke has aligned himself with Trump since the early days of the campaign, heaping praise on his derogatory remarks about Mexican immigrants and building a wall on the U.S.-Mexico border. While Trump initially claimed not to know who Duke was, he disavowed his support under pressure in February and has been asked to do so on multiple occasions since.

The white nationalist has trailed in the polls in Louisiana’s crowded Senate race, and is using the common threads between his campaign and Trump’s to bolster his support. In August, he launched a robocall effort telling Louisiana residents to support a Duke-Trump ticket, and he has lavished Trump with praise in multiple press interviews.

In his fundraising letter, Duke promises to send an autographed hat emblazoned with “I’m for Duke & Trump” on the front to all supporters who donate $50 or more to his campaign."
100676,1004,Saddle Up: Firebrand Sheriff Standing By His Call For ‘Pitchforks And Torches’,http://talkingpointsmemo.com/livewire/david-clarke-pitchforks-torches-tweets-founding-fathers,25,"Milwaukee County Sheriff David Clarke “meant it” when he shared a photo of an angry mob on Twitter with a caption reading “pitchforks and torches time.”

Firing back Monday at the “Leftist Big Media” for drawing attention to his tweet, which many social media users and journalists said could be interpreted as inciting violence, Clarke sent another tweet saying he would not allow his detractors to “intimidate and harass” him into dropping the inflammatory phrase.

In a blog post on Patheos and an interview on Fox News, Clarke insisted he was speaking rhetorically and not calling for an actual armed takeover of the U.S. government. “I’m suggesting the same thing the Founding Fathers did in the 1770s, when they drew up the Declaration of Independence,” the Milwaukee County sheriff and Donald Trump supporter said on “Fox and Friends."" “Go back and read your Declaration of Independence. It's right there. Were they inciting violence? No, what they wanted was self-rule, they wanted a government controlled by the people and not the bureaucrats in Washington.”

Though Clarke tried to make the case that his call to arms was comparable to Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-VT) referring to his tidal wave of support in the primaries as a progressive “revolution,” the goals of his “pitchforks and torches” campaign are quite distinct.

“It’s time to run those corrupt politicians out of Washington DC and back to whatever crevices they crawled from,” Clarke wrote in his Patheos blog post defending the tweets. “It’s time to put Mrs. Bill Clinton behind bars, where she belongs. And it’s time that the DOJ learns what the “J” stands for in their name.”

Clarke's Twitter feed is full of posts calling on the American people to ""rise up"" and claiming that the U.S. justice system ""ceased to be legitimate"" with its investigation into Clinton's use of a private email server as secretary of state.

These comments echo Trump’s own calls to appoint a special prosecutor to look into Clinton and his ominous warnings that the presidential election will be rigged if he loses.

Though Clarke lashed out at the “weepy” media for interpreting a photo of a screaming mob bearing torches as a call to violence, his comments come amid a series of deeply unsettling incidents.

Three militia members were arrested in Kansas on Friday for plotting to bomb a apartment complex home to Somali immigrants the day after the election, and authorities said a local North Carolina Republican party office was firebombed on Sunday.

Numerous Trump supporters interviewed at campaign events also have vowed to monitor the polls on Nov. 8, and some have even threatened to ""take out” Clinton if she is elected to the White House. A growing number of political observers are concerned that the Republican nominee might not accept the election results, and that Trump’s claims that the Democratic nominee should be “locked up” will delegitimize a potential Clinton administration."
100677,1005,A Confident Clinton Campaign Directs Resources to Arizona and Texas,http://www.motherjones.com/politics/2016/10/hillary-clinton-arizona-texas-trump,25,"With Donald Trump tanking in polls across the country, Hillary Clinton's campaign is broadening its ambitions, redirecting money and effort to states beyond the typical battlegrounds that she'd need to secure the 270 electoral votes to get to the White House.

During a conference call with reporters on Monday, campaign manager Robby Mook announced that the campaign intends to spend more time and energy bolstering down-ballot Democrats in hopes that Trump's cratering poll numbers could lead to success for Democrats in House and Senate races. ""Donald Trump is becoming more unhinged by the day, and that is increasing prospects for Democrats further down the ballot, because of higher-than-expected turnout and enthusiasm,"" Mook said, citing internal campaign tabulations that indicate more people will vote in 2016 than in any prior presidential election.

Mook announced that the campaign would be adding $2 million in new spending in Arizona on TV ads, digital ads, and direct mail. It is also dispatching Sen. Bernie Sanders, Chelsea Clinton, and Michelle Obama to campaign in the state this next week. Mook said Clinton herself might start stumping in the state in the final three weeks before Election Day.

Arizona was not generally considered a competitive state at the beginning of the year, but polls have shown a close race there, with three polls this month giving Clinton a small lead. It's hard to fathom a path to Electoral College victory for Trump without Arizona, but FiveThirtyEight gives Clinton a 54.6 percent chance of winning the state if the election were held today.

""Donald Trump's hateful rhetoric and deeply disrespectful remarks about Sen. John McCain have made Arizona more competitive,"" Mook said. ""This is a state that would really foreclose a path for Donald Trump to win the White House.""

Just how confident is the Clinton campaign feeling that Trump's support has bottomed out so deeply that new territories are up for grabs? The campaign is even going to start airing a short burst of ads in Texas, a state Barack Obama lost by 16 percentage points in 2012."
100678,1005,Private Prison Company Bankrolls Pro-Trump Super-PAC,http://www.motherjones.com/politics/2016/10/private-prison-company-geo-group-backs-pro-trump-super-pac,25,"It's unusual for a publicly traded corporation to donate to a super-PAC, but in August, private prison company GEO Group steered $150,000 to Rebuild America Now, a pro-Donald Trump outfit launched by the GOP nominee's longtime friend, developer Tom Barrack.

The timing of the GEO Group's contribution is significant. It cut a $100,000 check to the super-PAC on August 19, the day after the Justice Department announced that it would phase out the use of private prisons. (The company's political action committee donated $50,000 to Rebuild America Now a week before the announcement.)

The multibillion-dollar-a-year private prison industry has been under increasing scrutiny, in part thanks to a groundbreaking investigation by Mother Jones that revealed a litany of disturbing practices at a Louisiana prison run by the Corrections Corporation of America. GEO Group is one of just three companies that operate prisons and detention centers on behalf of the federal government. It's no surprise the company is putting its money behind Trump. While Hillary Clinton has sharply criticized private prisons, Trump has expressed support for expanding their use, and his policy proposals, including his plan to deport millions of undocumented immigrants, could be a boon for the industry. In addition to backing Trump, the company recently brought on three lobbying firms to represent its interests in Washington.

Trump was not the GEO Group's top choice for president. During the Republican primary campaign, the GEO Group gave $100,000 to a super-PAC backing Sen. Marco Rubio of Florida. The company's CEO, George Zoley, also donated to Rubio's presidential campaign.

A spokesman for the GEO Group did not respond to a request for comment."
100679,1006,The rigged election scare tactics are reaching meta levels on both sides,http://hotair.com/archives/2016/10/17/rigged-election-scare-tactics-reaching-meta-levels-sides/,25,"We’ve already passed the point where all hopes of a serious policy discussion in this presidential election have been dashed. That’s a shame, since there are so many important challenges which the next president will deal with. Instead we’re going to be talking about actresses being groped and whether or not one of the candidates is brain damaged for the next few weeks. Along with that, though, is a conversation I certainly didn’t see coming. On the Left we have a dedicated chorus of voices claiming that Trump is trying to undermine the nation by claiming that the election is rigged. But now, from the starboard flank, we have conservatives arguing that the Russians may be trying to use Trump as a tool to undermine America by, yes… making everyone fear that the election is rigged.

For our first example, let me turn the floor over to our old friend Matt Lewis writing at the Daily Caller. He starts off by offering some reader feedback he received which sets forth a dark, disturbing scenario, though one which is absent any sort of documented proof.

What if we are on the cusp of a true national and international crisis? Trump loses the election and instead of saying the American people have spoken, he continues to claim the election was rigged … To help with this, what if Russia decides to play with the election. On election night, they hack into the websites that are reporting results and show Trump leading when he really isn’t, or what if they actually hack some voting machines and Trump outperforms polls in those states by 8%+. Trump’s people use those states as examples to show that all of the other states are rigged. Russia, and other people who are friends with them (maybe even China), claim Trump is the rightful winner and should be President. Things keep escalating.
We should probably pause here for a moment and remind everyone that the losing candidate is not required to concede defeat. It’s a tradition, but if they fail to do so there will still be a vote in the Electoral College if there are no sanctioned recounts taking place. Also, foreign governments are not required to “accept” the election results in order for them to be legitimate. It’s a nice touch, but not required. And elections have been disputed by our own public in the past, including rather recently. How many Democrats spent 8 years claiming that Al Gore actually won the White House in 2000 and that George W. Bush’s presidency was illegitimate? The Republic somehow managed to not crumble into dust.

Matt goes on from there to recount his own questions about those clever Russians and how this may be their ticket to taking down the United States without firing a shot.

Back in September, I interviewed cyber security expert Igor Volovich, CEO and co-founder of ROMAD Cyber Systems, about the hacking scandals. Volovich took this scenario very seriously, describing the hypothetical interference in our upcoming election as a potential “Democracy 9/11.”

“The erosion of democratic institutions is a true objective,” Volovich warned. And, unlike the old days, where undermining a nation’s institutions took decades, “It’s very easy; you just compromise the polling stations. You compromise the polling boxes. You compromise the portal that reports the news. And we saw all of that take place in Ukraine in 2014.”
On the surface I’ll be the first to admit that our democracy only works if the people have faith in it. I accept this premise and the danger which could result if a sufficiently large segment of the population came to feel that our system of government wasn’t just incompetent, steeped in cronyism and occasionally corrupt, but actually a big, Matrix-style illusion. That would be a bad thing.

But if you’re assuming that the American people are actually going to leap off that particular ledge just because a losing candidate complained about the results or some (presumably) Russian hackers got up to some mischief in people’s email accounts, you are either selling the American people awfully short or you need to check into some sedatives. First of all you are relying on Russian hackers being able to swing the total vote count by as much as 8% on a national level or at least in a half dozen critical states. That’s millions of votes. Do you really think that our spooks are so inept that they couldn’t detect this while simultaneously believing that they’re savvy enough to track down the location and command structure of the people who cracked John Podesta’s G-mail password?

If there was a major hacking disruption on election day it would be exposed and we’d probably have to do it over. That would be a major disruption but not a constitutional crisis and ironically it would, in all likelihood, strengthen the faith of the voters in our ability to detect and prevent such mischief.

But at the same time, let’s not toss out our wariness over government systems entirely. I’ve written on the subject more than enough here and it’s a fact that we have dead people voting (as well as collecting government benefits) and a political media which is not above putting a thumb on the scale from time to time. (Has anyone checked to see if Donna Brazile has gotten access to this Wednesday’s debate questions?) Is all of this enough to completely flip over a presidential election? That’s beyond doubtful, but it’s still enough to rightly concern voters. What we should do is keep a closer eye on the media and look at some other steps (such as keeping track of when people die) to clean up the process and further increase voter confidence rather than eroding it.

Or we could blame the whole thing on some vast Donald Trump – Vladimir Putin conspiracy. If nothing else it should make for one heck of a movie if Jack Ryan’s character isn’t busy."
100680,1006,New Project Veritas video: How left-wing groups and the DNC arrange astroturf agitation at Trump events for Hillary’s benefit,http://hotair.com/archives/2016/10/17/new-project-veritas-video-left-wing-groups-dnc-arrange-astroturf-agitation-trump-events-hillarys-benefit/,25,"A long clip but worth your time, especially since James O’Keefe’s promising more this week. You’ll need to know the cast of players now so you’re up to speed for the next video.

Most of this is devoted to introducing you to the glutinous mass of liberal organizations that work with — sort of — the Clinton campaign and the DNC to protest Republican events. One of the open questions here, and key to any legal issue, is whether the campaign itself is coordinating with the Super PACs who are allegedly involved in these activities. Campaigns are strictly barred by law from contact with PACs; maybe there’s more to come about that in the next videos, but for now it’s clear at least that there’s some chain of command to all of this and that the DNC is involved in some astroturfing. (“Astroturf” refers to political protests that are designed to look like they were organized by regular grassroots people but are secretly orchestrated by professional political actors.) The key figure here is activist Scott Foval, who describes the various sleazy tactics he uses to send agitators into Republican events — often with the hope that a fight will break out. Ideally you’ll be attacked, he tells one undercover recruit in the first few minutes of the vid. Later he boasts about using mentally ill homeless people to agitate and then rewarding them later with pay and a chance to get clean. It’s all about “bird-dogging,” creating a sense of anarchy at Trump events that’ll feed the media narrative that Trump’s fans are unhinged. One thing he doesn’t describe, though, unless I missed it, is actually initiating violence. What he’s talking about is baiting people at Trump’s rallies — wear a conspicuous “Planned Parenthood” t-shirt to an event, ask Trump an uncomfortable question when he comes over to fans in line to say hi, and then see if anyone reacts by getting pushy. That’s another obvious possibility for the next videos. Did Foval say at any point that he’s sending people in to start fights by throwing the first punch? There’s an enormous difference, obviously, between forcing a Trump supporter to defend himself physically and expecting a physical confrontation by expressing yourself verbally.

The highlight, I think, is DNC operative “Aaron Black” admitting at around 9:30 that the left-wing protests that turned into a famous melee outside one of Trump’s events in Chicago this past March was a DNC production. The fact that that incident was astroturf isn’t surprising. What is surprising is that the DNC ever would have thought that violence outside a Trump rally would hurt Trump more than help him. He’s an authoritarian candidate who preaches law and order; I remember watching the DNC’s stooges shutting down his event that night live on CNN and wondering how many undecided voters would decide that Trump is exactly the sort of president we need to prevent this sort of anarchy. Democrats must have come to the same conclusion later because, apart from an even uglier violent protest at a Trump event in San Jose, California, in June, there haven’t been many major clashes at Trump rallies this summer and fall. Maybe, ironically, Foval and his superiors belatedly came to the conclusion that his brand of agitation was destined to backfire this year and toned it down a bit in recent months. We’ll know more when the next tape emerges."
100681,1006,WaPo/ABC poll: Trump still within margin of error?,http://hotair.com/archives/2016/10/17/wapoabc-poll-trump-still-within-margin-error/,25,"Is it possible that, after all the allegations about Donald Trump that have emerged over the last two weeks, that Hillary Clinton might have only gained two points in a national poll series — and Trump remains within the margin of error? Er, probably not, but that’s what the latest Washington Post/ABC News poll shows. Thanks in part to a deeply dug-in electorate and a lack of enthusiasm for any choice, Hillary leads by four in both the two-way and four-way race polling. Even the Post’s Scott Clement and Dan Balz can’t quite believe the data, emphasis mine:

Overall, Clinton leads Trump by 47-43 percent among likely voters, a slight edge given the survey’s four-percentage-point error margin. Libertarian Party nominee Gary Johnson has the support of 5 percent, and Green Party nominee Jill Stein is at 2 percent. Among registered voters, the poll shows a similar four-point margin, with Clinton at 44, Trump at 40, Johnson at 6 and Stein at 3. In a two-way matchup, Clinton leads Trump by 50-46 percent among likely voters and by 50-44 percent among registered voters.

The current findings show only slight changes from the last Post-ABC survey, which was taken on the eve of the first presidential debate. At that time, Clinton held an insignificant two-point edge over Trump among likely voters. The findings are somewhat better for Trump than other polls taken since the video, but if Clinton were to maintain such an advantage until Election Day, that could translate into a sizable electoral college majority.
Citing other polls to call into question one’s own? That’s an interesting marketing strategy. According to RCP’s aggregation and averages, it might be a wee bit overstated as well. The latest NBC/WSJ poll puts Hillary up 11 points, but that seems to be an outlier, as does the LA Times tracking poll that puts Trump up by one and Rasmussen’s Trump +2. The RCP average puts Hillary up by less than six points in both the four-way and binary races, so a Hillary +4 isn’t outside the ballpark.

Still, the other internals seem to call into question whether this is for real. Hillary has a poor 42/56 favorability rating, but Trump’s is worse at 37/62. Hillary has a lead on almost all of the issue questions, with the most depressing being an eight-point advantage on ethics in government (45/37, RVs). Despite Trump’s attempts to paint himself as a working-class hero, Hillary beats him by double digits on protecting the middle class (51/37, RVs).

But it seems even more suspect when looking at the responses to the allegations and remarks that have come out since the 9/22 poll. The videotape makes 35% of voters less likely to support Trump, and 68% believe that Trump has made “unwanted sexual advances on women.” Only 40% buy the explanation that Trump’s “grab her by the p****” tape was just “typical locker room talk by men.” Even with all of that, though, Trump has barely lost ground. Why?

The rest of the poll suggests that he’s hitting a floor. The percentage of Trump voters who are firm in their decision went up from 85% to 88%; Hillary’s went up from 83% to 89%. The bigger question, though, is whether Trump’s voters will show up. His voter-enthusiasm number dropped to its lowest level in weeks, to 79% from 91% in late September. Twenty-one percent now say they are not enthusiastic, compared to 16% for Hillary. Until this iteration of the poll, Trump held a distinct advantage in enthusiasm, but now that ten-point advantage has morphed into a four-point deficit — a 14-point swing in 21 days. That indicates that the attacks may be working, and it might make a difference on Election Day.

That’s perhaps a bit more interesting as it relates to the generic Congressional ballot, which stands at a surprising D+3 — indicating nearly no change in the makeup of the House, and perhaps signaling some unexpected strength for Republicans in the Senate battle. With a D+8 polling sample and their nominee’s voters getting a bit demoralized, Republicans have to feel pretty good about being within three points on the generic Congressional ballot."
100682,1007,Undercover Video Proves DNC and Hillary Camp Paid People to Incite Violence at Trump Rallies,http://www.youngcons.com/undercover-video-proves-dnc-and-hillary-camp-paid-people-to-incite-violence-at-trump-rallies/,25,"Project Veritas has uncovered some major questions about voter fraud in New Hampshire.

Can’t forget about New York, either.

Now, a new video has been released showing how the DNC and the Hillary Clinton campaign were actually paying people to incite violence at Donald Trump rallies.

So, suspicions confirmed?

From Western Journalism:

According to an investigation by Project Veritas, numerous disruptions and disturbances at Donald Trump rallies, including violent outbreaks, have been carried out by an organization that receives funding and marching orders from Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton’s campaign.


The undercover investigatory group, led by James O’Keefe, this year infiltrated an organization known as Americans United for Change, where it recorded Scott Foval, National Field Director as revealing that the organization contracts “directly with the DNC and the (Clinton) campaign both.”

Speaking to an undercover reporter, Foval said funding for the “conflict engagement” that are the group’s hallmark takes a circuitous, if not illegal, route. “The (Clinton) campaign pays DNC, DNC pays Democracy Partners, Democracy Partners pays the Foval Group, The Foval Group goes and executes the s***… …Democracy Partners is the tip of the spear on that stuff,” he said.


Foval then explained the reason for this roundabout process is so those at the top “can plausibly deny that they knew anything about it.”

“The campaigns and DNC cannot go near [Super PAC] Priorities, but I guaran-d**n-tee you that the people who run the Super PACs all talk to each other and we and a few other people are the hubs of that communication,” he added.

Foval was not shy about touting his successes, and noted that the goal of planting activists at Trump events is to spur Trump’s supporters into reacting.

…

One of Foval’s lieutenants, Aaron Black, called himself “deputy rapid response director for the DNC for all things Trump on the ground,” adding that, “nobody is really supposed to know about me.”

WARNING: STRONG LANGUAGE*** If Democrats promised to not sling mud and run strictly on the issues, they’d never win.

They have nothing positive to say about America, and even the most dim-witted would eventually wake up and realize progressive policies hold people back.

Instead, Dems rely on stupidity from their followers and do an excellent job of taking advantage.

If you ain’t cheatin’ you ain’t tryin,’ right?"

Read between the lines.

In order to get some of the heat off of them, Democrats have hired actresses from Trump’s past with stories that will keep the press busy.

There’s no proof, but it’s not exactly a crazy theory, is it?

Here’s how the Clintons are supposedly feeling at the moment…

From New York Post: Hillary Clinton is “pissed,” Chelsea Clinton is “hurt,” and Bill Clinton is “having a hard time,” according to a new report detailing the reaction to hacked emails of a top aide being slowly released by WikiLeaks.

The reactions of the former (and possible future) first family is detailed by Politico. “The goal of this is to create dissension between everyone,” Neera Tanden, whose many emails with John Podesta have been released in the WikiLeaks dump, told Politico.

“This is Russian psy-ops. That’s what they’re trying to do. The campaign is going to fight back against that, by not getting subsumed in dissension,” Tanden added. The Clinton campaign has made a point of not talking on the record about the released emails — refusing even to confirm the validity of the trove of Podesta correspondences.

“Pissed,” really?

I highly doubt it.

Hillary sleeps comfortably at night knowing she can call up nearly any member of the media and have them spin the story."

Probably both.

It’s because of people like this guy that America is in decline.

Raandy doesn’t respect the rule of law, and hopefully he’ll wind up paying for it.

Such a Democrat move. He doesn’t agree, so he throws a tantrum to get his way.

Awfully child-like. Trump supporter Scott Baio’s response…

 Other reactions, plus Raandy’s replies…

 So now what, Raandy?

The people whose ballots you tampered with don’t get a vote, but you’re free to support the most corrupt politician of her era?

Guess he’s never heard of electoral fraud, or the penalties in his state.

This is how Dems win.

Voter fraud is key.

100685,1008,Donald Trump's Moral Fervor,http://www.americanthinker.com/articles/2016/10/donald_trumps_moral_fervor.html,25,"At a time when the ""news"" media betray their own hyped up values of objectivity and fairness, I am beginning to hear a growing voice of moral outrage in America – and it's actually expressed in clear words, day after day, by the Republican nominee for president of the United States.  That would be Donald Trump. 

That last sentence is bound to set any lost and lonely lefty loony screaming with hysterical laughter, but hyenas are what they are.  From the hyena's point of view, Republicans are just another meat.  The GOP establishment is shivering in the foxholes, and its members are losing voters as fast as Trump gains them.  If Trump tells his supporters to vote against down-ballot Republicans, the establishment will reverse course.  They count on our stupidity and our goodwill, but we are no longer stupid. 

The Clintons and Obamas have made normal Americans despair, but the voters care.  They care a lot.  Americans who care haven't had a voice in U.S. politics for a long time, but if normal people had given up on the stench from D.C., the Rasmussen polls would not be showing a neck-and-neck race.  Enough Americans care to make this a game-changing election.

We have been deeply disappointed often by the One Party Machine.  But we care enough to keep listening for that voice in the desert. 

Rush Limbaugh keeps pointing out that the chief goal of the left is demoralizing Americans.  He is right.  If they can keep you home on election night, they win.  They know how to kill off our best leaders.  Saul Alinsky said it in his little book, the one Hillary wrote her B.A. thesis about, way back when. 

(Hillary's B.A. thesis is now only a click away, and it's ""must"" reading for Americans.  That thesis gives us the key to Hillary's life.  She was cult-indoctrinated at Wellesley College at an age when young people are notoriously vulnerable.  She might have become a Scientologist, but she became a hard leftist instead.  Hillary's generation of ambitious feminists are now in jobs of power and influence, and most of them go along with the immiseration of women and children in the reactionary world of jihad.  Hillary chose her lifelong path at Wellesley, and she has a one-track mind.) 

Yes, Donald Trump is a flawed human being, as the hyena pack keeps yodeling in the night.  But as far as I know, he is not a serial abuser like Bill Clinton, nor is he a feminist enabler of randy male misbehavior like Hillary. 

If Trump disappoints us, we will find a way to be heard.  We can't stop watching politics when the polls close. 

Women used to be praised as a civilizing influence on men, bringing the responsibilities of love and loyalty to marriage and children.  Hillary has spent her adult life enabling the most irresponsible men on the block, thereby setting an example for a whole generation of Millennials, who have now created a pickup scene that is surprisingly depressing.  Millennials seem to get that they could stay home to watch fantasy porn on the web instead of being with real human beings.  Fantasies are more hygienic, and they never disappoint.  ""Can I pick you up?"" is inevitably followed by ""Where will I drop you off?""

Unlike the left, conservatives are not slaves of Big Media.  We think for ourselves and come to our own conclusions.  And waddayaknow: it looks as if there are thousands of Democrats now crossing party lines to kick the bums out – not because they are suckered by Trump's pizzazz, but because they feel the same outrage the rest of us feel.  Credible reports say FBI agents are in an uproar about James Comey's obvious betrayal of justice, and yes, there are career attorneys in the DOJ who feel pretty grim about Obama commissars.  Rudy Giuliani still has enough contacts in that world to give us the real skinny.  A lot of career lawyers went into the Department of Justice not to see super-crooks taking over the joint. 

That national feeling of outrage can't be contained by the usual lies and distractions, even if the hyena chorus fills the wailing night air.  For morally serious people in D.C., Trump represents a glimmer of light at the end of a long, miserable tunnel.  If he wins, they will find their voices again.

The same goes for the U.S. military and the IRS.  Even the education establishment isn't following Obama's bathroom decrees for elementary school children who want to choose their own gender.  Give educators a chance, and we may hear the suppressed voices of outrage.  Black parents know what's happening in their schools, courtesy of the teacher unions.  It's past time for a big change, and automatic teacher tenure has to go.  We all know it. 

Ain't nuthin' to it but to do it. 

Trump is leading the biggest revolt against the Establishment since Reagan.  He does it by telling the truths we all know.  It sounds simple, but it's very hard to accomplish, which is why we have to unify and add our own voices.  The left believes in ""organizing.""  Conservatives need to be much more effective. 

We've known for decades that Bill and Hillary are mega-crooks, and I still feel shocked by that hundred-thousand-dollar bribe from the cattle traders in Arkansas.  We knew the Clintons were dirty from that moment onward, and you have to give the Crooked Couple credit for consistency.  They are as wicked today as they were when Bill was filling that doublewide trailer in Little Rock with his smoldering joints and cocaine lines. 

As for the Obamas, we know they were mentored by the Godfather of the Illinois Machine, Emil Jones, a man who makes the dead rise again every election to walk the ghostly streets of Chicago.  We've listened plenty enough to the ""reverends"" Jerry Wright, Al Sharpton, and Louis Farrakhan.  There is no boundary between the Chicago mafia and the left, as Saul Alinsky demanded in that evil little book. 

This is a Caligula time in American politics.  If Hillary becomes president, we can expect her to nominate a horse for the U.S. Senate, like the Emperor Caligula, just to show her contempt.  Already there are rumors she will kill off the Second Amendment by executive order the first time she steps into the Oval. 

Hyenas are what they are, and narcissistic pols are what they are.  We all know it, and while we feel miserable to see America brought so low, we are no longer in denial. 

Sometimes our strongest moral intuitions are our best guide.  Every 24 hours, Big Media attacks us with new dead-on-arrival scare lines about Trump's wrongdoings, and the next morning we expect to see no sunrise.  But the sun comes up again every day, and for the first time in years, we are seeing a public shout of outrage in America.  Keep it up.  Don't give her a single day of headlines.

Trump didn't make this moment.  Conservative thinkers have laid the foundations.  But it took Trump to see it, and to seize the moment.  That is to his credit. 

Win or lose, the Trump Moment of 2016 will be talked about for a long time to come.  Politicians are all trying to repeat his tactics, whether he wins or not.  Hillary is old hat.  Trump is a voice of truth. 

Now let's push him over the top.

100686,1008,Hillary's and Bill’s Art of the Deal,http://www.americanthinker.com/articles/2016/10/hillary_and_bills_art_of_the_deal.html,25,"Imagine Hillary Rodham and Bill Clinton’s first date at Yale.  After dinner in some joint -- followed by a joint they didn’t inhale – first year law student Hillary peers penetratingly through her oversized owl glasses into the baby blues of her tall date and asks, ‘’So, what do you want to be when you grow up, Bill?”

Sheepishly, a big-haired Bill smiles back at Four Eyes – a term I lifted from Erich Segal’s Love Story -- and says in his charming Southern drawl, “President of the United States!”  Hillary is aghast with delight.  “But that’s what I want to be!” she blurts out.  It was love of power at first sight.

They’ve had their ups and downs since then, but now they don’t hang around much together except at campaign time.   Back in 2000, Al Gore -- whose hulk has surfaced recently to remind Democrats that every vote counts -- would have nothing to do with President Clinton throughout the Gore-Lieberman campaign for the White House.  Bill had been impeached and disbarred.  Nobody would touch him – politically, at least.  

But contrary to the pun that “time wounds all heels,” Bill Clinton has since rebounded, and once again ranks right up there in the polls as one of America’s most popular Democrat politicians.  And even Hillary – or especially Hillary – has come around to embracing him, in public at least.  She may have acted miffed at Bill all those years ago when the Sidney Blumenthal-crafted “vast right wing conspiracy” theory she posited about her husband’s affair with Monica Lewinsky was debunked. But she could no more stay angry at Bubba than she could expunge the mutual political ambitions lying deep within their souls.

In fact, Mrs. Clinton is the Great Pretender, a role for which she is ideally suited.  She has played it for what it’s worth so often that many confuse it with her true nature.  To her long-time representation as a self-sacrificing champion of women and children “from Day One,” Hillary has added the nuanced role of martyr that befits her sex. She takes pride in claiming that men have disparaged and even metaphorically grabbed at her ambition over the years.  And she subtly lays claim to being a victim -- you know, like all those whose votes she depends on to get elected.

Finding pay dirt in the latest string of accusations against Donald Trump’s conduct, Hillary aired her outrage against him on the Ellen DeGeneres show, claiming that her bully opponent had “literally stalked” her during their second debate.  That’s the same role she played, incidentally, during her first run for the US Senate, her body language registering repulsion when her young Republican opponent dared to “invade her space” on the debate stage.  This time around, she did not hesitate to wander over and stand in front of Donald Trump, conveniently setting up a scenario in which he can later be accused of “lurking” or “looming” over her.  It’s political theater at its most hypocritical.

Stuff like this may seem picayune, but when the “victim” is Hillary Clinton, it plays well with a supportive media. Over her long acting career in politics, onstage or off she has used people as props to enhance her own performance.  Donald Trump may have authored The Art of the Deal, but in politics, Hillary Clinton is a far better wheeler-dealer than he is.

Trump recognizes Hillary as a “fighter.”  What he doesn’t understand is how disarmingly she has been able to back him onto the ropes.  He hasn’t gone down for the count yet, but time is ticking, and for all his bravado, The Donald hasn’t displayed the necessary footwork to get our of Hillary’s way.   He’s been thrown in the official “ring” with her twice already, and while his performance has improved, it hasn’t been good enough.

On Wednesday, he will have another chance to throw some punches that may hit their mark.  But in the run-up to that final round, he has been wasting valuable time.  Still reeling from the “locker room” tape, Trump now finds a flurry of   bad behavior accusations from women raining blows upon him. One can’t fault his being defensive about the suspect  “sexual predator” charges, but he’s spending too much time dancing around them instead of landing some punches with other issues, such as the revelations in the Wikileaks’ hacked Clinton emails, the Iranian-backed missiles fired at our Navy’s ships in Middle Eastern waters, the costly failure of Obamacare, the anemic jobs recovery, etc.  Hillary’s unchallenged evasion on these and other issues once again demonstrates the skillful dodge and weave of a seasoned politician.

According to some medical authorities, the acrimony of the current presidential slugfest has gotten to a majority of voters in both parties. Those whose blood pressure is going through the roof or whose ordinarily blissful sleep habits have been disrupted are advised to turn off the TV and take a walk, or get involved in a hobby other than that of political junkie.  

After this is all over, we may be invaded by an army of obligatory “grief counselors.”  I’m not predicting which voters will be queuing up for solace, but from my standpoint  I hope their services  are covered by Medicare.

 Before then, however, there’s the third debate, which pessimists claim could be the final blow to knock Trump out of contention.   Hillary  -- with her long history of deflecting questions by using well-rehearsed platitudes, denials and further attacks on her opponent – has a distinct advantage.  All she has to do is play her familiar part:  stand there and look reasonably healthy and superciliously feminine as she reacts to Trump’s comments with amusement or pseudo-shock. 

Between now and Election Day, Trump supporters will remain Trump supporters.  But in return for their abiding enthusiasm, the candidate in whom they have invested so much hope and trust should stop sparring with the media and the GOP.  Instead, he should seriously train to face an opponent whose dream of becoming the first woman president began at Yale and hasn’t ended yet.

100687,1008,Rigged Elections and Professional Wrestling,http://www.americanthinker.com/articles/2016/10/rigged_elections_and_professional_wrestling.html,25,"Monday Night Raw is a professional wrestling television program.  Leaked documents from the show ""[i]ndicate that professional wrestling is a rigged spectacle in which match outcomes are predetermined.""  Many will say ho hum; this is not news.  Of course it's rigged.  But many pro wrestling fans will be surprised to know that ""they have been duped by a phony sport.""

The same could be said for recent presidential elections.  Is the current election a rigged game?  Is the outcome predetermined?  Have the voters been duped by a phony democratic process?  It's looking more and more as if this election is simply a high-stakes form of professional wrestling.

Two wrestlers, Donny and Hilly, enter the arena to fanfare, music, and the cheers of adoring fans.  Hilly has been in professional wrestling for decades and is well known by wrestling fans.  Donny made a name for himself outside wrestling, in football and other sports.  Donny, by virtue of his non-wrestling sports experience, brings a new skillset to pro wrestling, which has been becoming a dull sport.

Fans expecting a good flight see anything but – a referee calling penalties left and right on Donny while allowing obvious fouls and transgressions by Hilly.  The announcers and ringside sports reporters are much the same.  Despite Donny dominating the match, they proclaim Hilly the superior wrestler and ultimately the winner.  The fight judges agree, despite Donny scoring obvious points.  Fans leave the arena in disgust, wondering what happened and why they wasted their time and money.

Any objective observer can see this contest playing out in 2016 in a scripted manner, similar to many past elections.

Hillary Clinton was the anointed one long before she was selected for the big title fight.  She met Bernie Sanders in some preliminary bouts and more than met her match.  He was the better wrestler and the fan favorite.  The prima donna was outraged and, through her superdelegates, put Bernie in his place.  If Bernie ever wanted to wrestle again, he had better concede and support Mrs. Clinton.  Bernie fans, many new to the sport, wondered how such an obvious sham match could occur.

On the Republican side, Jeb was the chosen contender, darling of the establishment, elites, and GOP donor class.  Along comes Donald Trump, contradicting standard GOP talking points, discussing immigration, walls, trade deals, and Muslims, not part of any Republican script.  Leading man Jeb melted like a snow cone in the hot sun.  Other supporting actors tried to get the show script back on track, but too late.  Trump struck a note, not with the Republican Party, but instead with the voters.  The fans.  Those paying to see the show.

The script for the 2016 wrestling match is for the first woman to win the White House.  Devoid of accomplishments, temperament, ethics, honesty, stamina, and a host of other presidential attributes, she is the declared winner of the match long before the first round.

The referee is the American media establishment.  Newspapers of record with mottos ""All the news that's fit to print"" or ""The newspaper shall tell ALL the truth so far as it can learn it, concerning the important affairs of America and the world.""  Cable and broadcast news networks charged with  being ""fair and balanced.  CNN claims to be ""The Most Trusted Name in News.""  Are they calling an honest fight?  Or are they doing everything in their power to affect a particular outcome?

Why are women's decades-old accusations of unwanted sexual advances or rape totally believable and newsworthy when directed against one candidate but ignored, belittled, and discredited when directed against the other candidate?

Why is audio of Donald Trump talking trash worthy of the N.Y. Times front page, but an interview with rape victim Juanita Broaddrick suppressed and ignored?

The October surprise chasing Donald Trump is as predictable as shorter days and cooler temperatures every October.  George H.W. Bush was supposedly having an affair with his secretary.  George W. Bush had a DUI when he was young and foolish.  John McCain was having an affair.  Mitt Romney hated dogs, tried to kill his employee's wife by cutting insurance, and never paid his taxes.  All ancient history, mostly false, but worthy of media scrutiny only weeks before a presidential election.

Now we have Trump as a groper, cad, and sexual predator.  Funny how Trump has been in the public eye for over 30 years, and we never heard such stories about him.  Not until last week did he become Bill Cosby.  Or Bill Clinton.  Just as he was never a racist throughout his long public life but instantly became one when he announced his presidential candidacy last year.

In the wrestling arena, the sports media can refute and shame a crooked referee.  In this contest, it's the Republican establishment that could defend and fight for its candidate – perhaps not their chosen candidate, but that of their constituents.  The little people in flyover country who receive endless phone calls, emails, and letters asking for votes and a check.  The little people have spoken, but the Republican Party has other ideas.

The poor saps who pay for a ticket to see the big fight are not seeing an athletic contest – one where the more skillful wrestler wins.  They are seeing theater – a show with actors, actresses, and a script to be followed.

A rigged system.  As Trump himself said, ""the whole thing is one big fix.""  Shame on the media and the Republican establishment for rigging the fight and telling the fans it's fair.

Those who rig actual sporting events are eventually caught and banished from the sport.  Time to banish the fixers; regardless of how this current fight ends, they have lost what little credibility they had and will be viewed as nothing but the sideshow they are playing in this election.

100688,1009,TRUMP UNSHACKLED,http://www.powerlineblog.com/archives/2016/10/trump-unshackled.php,25,"Last week, Donald Trump proclaimed that “the shackles have been taken off me.” He wasn’t kidding.

Unshackled, Trump has responded affirmatively to cries of “lock [Hillary]’ up” (the shackled Trump used to respond “defeat her”). He has attacked the physical appearance of a woman who accused him of sexual touching. And he claims that such allegations are part — not just of collaboration with Democrats and the media, which is plausible — but of a global conspiracy.

Pundits offer various theories for why Trump has gone in this bizarre direction. Is he trying to lay the foundation for an alt-right media empire? Is he trying to take down the Republican party? Does he think, somehow, that this unshackled approach will improve his electoral prospects? Or is he just very, very angry?

None of these explanations should be dismissed, but none is necessary. The most obvious explanation is also the primary one: this is who Trump is and who he wants to be — a nasty, vicious authoritarian.

If Trump’s antics hurt the GOP, I’m confident he will consider this an added benefit. Trump is contemptuous of Republicans. He believes we are “just too crazy.”

This year, we proved him correct. We lived up to our billing as the stupid party.

With Trump as our leader, we would also become the vile party. Stupid is one thing; stupid and vile would go too far.

How much will Trump damage congressional Republicans this year? Less than I suspect he’d like. Senate and House incumbents are known to their constituents, who can easily distinguish them from Trump. When Trump attacks them, either individually or as a class, he reinforces the distinction.

Trump nonetheless poses a dilemma for folks like Kelly Ayotte: denounce Trump and alienate his voters or don’t denounce him and alienate some swing female voters. In a close election, Trump might pull a few incumbents down. This could make all the difference when it comes to control of the Senate.

However, as Trump’s defeat comes to seem inevitable, a different dynamic kicks in. Hillary Clinton is massively unpopular and voters don’t want to give her a “blank check.” Thus, incumbents like Ayotte, Ron Johnson, Pat Toomey, and Richard Burr may benefit.

I’m pretty sure that Republican congressional candidates would prefer a more traditional nominee and, short of that, a “shackled” Trump — like the one who was running even with Clinton before he screwed up in the first debate. But even those in tight races will believe, not without cause, that they can overcome the Choke Artist’s antics and prevail in November.

100689,1009,HILLARY’S HENCHMEN PRESSURED FBI ON CLASSIFICATION OF DOCUMENTS,http://www.powerlineblog.com/archives/2016/10/hillarys-henchmen-pressured-fbi-on-classification-of-documents.php,25,"Today the FBI released another 100 pages relating to its investigation of Hillary Clinton’s conduct as Secretary of State. Why it has taken so long for the agency to review, redact and publish a very small quantity of documents is inexplicable. Be that as it may, the documents released today are explosive.

You may have seen headlines to the effect that Hillary’s State Department tried to pressure the FBI to say that various documents located on Hillary’s insecure home server were not classified. This was critical, obviously, because one of Hillary’s lines of defense was to claim, falsely, that she never sent or received classified documents on her off-the-books email system.

Those headlines are correct, but to get the full impact you really have to see the relevant portions of the FBI investigation. Here they are; in all cases, click to enlarge. But first, a description.

In the first page, an unidentified FBI employee says he was “pressured” to change the classification of an email to render it unclassified. This pressure came from someone within the FBI, who said he had been contacted by Undersecretary of State Patrick Kennedy, who “had asked his assistance in altering the email’s classification in exchange for a ‘quid pro quo.'” The quid pro quo was that, if the FBI would say the email was unclassified, the State Department would allow the FBI to “place more Agents in countries where they are presently forbidden.”

Subsequently, the interviewee was summoned to an “all agency” meeting at the State Department to discuss the classification review of the Hillary Clinton emails. This fact itself is astonishing: the meeting was attended by representatives of the State Department, the CIA, the Defense Intelligence Agency “and other government agencies,” including, obviously, the FBI. Patrick Kennedy presided. Someone asked whether any of the Hillary emails that were being reviewed for production were classified. Kennedy replied, “Well, we’ll see.”

Following the all agency meeting, Undersecretary of State Kennedy renewed his effort to pressure the FBI to change its classification of the document in question. The FBI representative wouldn’t budge, so Kennedy asked who else at the agency he could talk to. The interviewee gave the name of Michael Steinbach.

The interviewee then participated in a call with Kennedy and Steinbach, in which Kennedy “continued to pressure the FBI to change the classified markings on the email to unclassified.” Steinbach refused. What happened next is–deserves to be, anyway–a bombshell.

Prior to ending the conversation, KENNEDY asked whether the FBI or STATE would conduct the public statements on the matter. STEINBACH advised KENNEDY that the FBI would not comment publicly on the matter.

That was enough for the astonishingly corrupt Hillary Clinton. This is what happened next:

The conference call ended and, according to [ ], the Associated Press (AP) published the story within the hour. Former Secretary of State Clinton appeared in front of the press shortly thereafter to deny having sent classified emails on her private email server.

Here are the first two pages of the relevant FBI investigation file: The next page of the FBI investigation report is a summary of an interview with someone at the agency–I assume the Mr. Steinbach already referred to. This person says that he got a phone call from Patrick Kennedy, which surprised him because he and another FBI official “had both been trying to contact KENNEDY for months without response.” What did Kennedy want? He “asked [ ] assistance in changing a classification of FBI information contained in an email.”

Kennedy explained that the classified email “caused problems,” and he wanted to categorize the document as a B9. The reference apparently is to a Freedom of Information Act exemption, but this is not clear. In any event, Kennedy said that such a classification would “allow him to archive the document in the basement of DoS [the State Department] never to be seen again.” Here is that page of the investigation report: Finally, the last page of this part of the report quotes an FBI employee whose name is redacted, who contacted Patrick Kennedy to talk about the classification issue. Before talking to Kennedy, he learned that “the email of KENNEDY’s concern was classified by the FBI Counterterrorism Division (CTD) and was related to the attacks on the U.S. Consulate in Benghazi.” Having been told this, the FBI interviewee “contacted KENNEDY and informed him that there was no way he could assist KENNEDY with declassifying the information contained in the email.” We have here a clear pattern of corruption that makes Watergate look like child’s play. Hillary’s aide, Patrick Kennedy, tried to bribe the FBI to change the classification of a Benghazi document so as to enable Hillary’s false claim that she didn’t send or receive classified information on her illegal home server. The FBI, to its credit, refused. (James Comey wasn’t involved at that stage.)

Hillary’s aide then asked whether the FBI would be saying anything publicly about the classification issue. Once assured that the FBI would be silent, Hillary took the stage and alleged publicly, and falsely, that she never used her illegal home server to send or receive classified information. One wonders, too, how many critically important documents have been “archive[d] … in the basement of DoS [the State Department] never to be seen again,” based on bogus FOIA exemptions.

Donald Trump has his faults, but Hillary Clinton is far too corrupt to serve as President of the United States."
100690,1009,ACADEMIC ABSURDITY OF THE WEEK: WHO’S AGAINST SCIENCE AGAIN?,http://www.powerlineblog.com/archives/2016/10/academic-absurdity-of-the-week-whos-against-science-again.php,25,"Next time you hear someone repeat the thoughtless cliche that conservatives are “anti-science,” direct them to the YouTube video below, which has been making the rounds the last few days and has had nearly 600,000 views as of this afternoon. Here you will take in a typically politicized student, at South Africa’s University of Cape Town, arguing that “Science as a whole is a product of western modernity, and the whole thing should be scratched off.” The audience laughs with approval at this apparent bold transgression, and when someone interjects, at about the one minute mark, that “It’s not true,” he is shouted down and demanded to make an apologize for having violated their “progressive safe space.” Chairman Mao would have been proud.

And then the nonsense resumes, starting with a denial of the theory of gravity. Steven Novella of the NeuroLogicaBlog summarizes it thus:

She gives as an example that Newton saw an apple fall, made up gravity, wrote down some equations, and now that is scientific truth imposed on the world forever (seriously, I am not exaggerating this one bit).

The other pillar of her position is that in Africa there are practitioners of black magic who can summon a lightening bolt at their enemy. This is not explainable by “Western” science, and yet this is African knowledge, and therefore is an example of Western colonialism suppressing indigenous wisdom. This provides an occasion to mention Dan Sarewitz’s important essay from several weeks ago in The New Atlantis, “Saving Science,” which is one of the best discussions to date of the problem the presumptions, herd mentality, and politicization of the scientific community today. It is a healthy reminder that most of the “science denial” mongers are really political actors who dislike dissent from the political agenda to which so much “science” is put today.

It’s very much worth reading this long and wide-ranging article, but here’s the opener:

Science, pride of modernity, our one source of objective knowledge, is in deep trouble. Stoked by fifty years of growing public investments, scientists are more productive than ever, pouring out millions of articles in thousands of journals covering an ever-expanding array of fields and phenomena. But much of this supposed knowledge is turning out to be contestable, unreliable, unusable, or flat-out wrong. From metastatic cancer to climate change to growth economics to dietary standards, science that is supposed to yield clarity and solutions is in many instances leading instead to contradiction, controversy, and confusion. Along the way it is also undermining the four-hundred-year-old idea that wise human action can be built on a foundation of independently verifiable truths. Science is trapped in a self-destructive vortex; to escape, it will have to abdicate its protected political status and embrace both its limits and its accountability to the rest of society.

I’ll add this this critique goes double for social science."
100691,1010,Trump blames firebombing of North Carolina GOP office on ‘animals representing Hillary Clinton’,https://thinkprogress.org/trump-politicizes-north-carolina-firebombing-a429293724c3#.k8s6gobai,25,"Someone tossed a firebomb into a Republican Party headquarters in Orange County, North Carolina late Saturday or early Sunday. While nobody was hurt, the bombing did extensive damage.
The culprit or culprits also spray-painted “Nazi Republicans leave town or else” on the property. It’s unclear who’s responsible for the bombing. But that didn’t prevent Donald Trump from immediately racing to conclusions and blaming “animals representing Hillary Clinton.”
 A few minutes later, Trump followed up by saying he’ll “never forget” and sees the bombing as a sign that “we have to win.”
 Politicizing violence is nothing new for Trump, of course. He used last November’s terror attacks in Paris to make an argument for more guns. A month later, Trump seized upon the mass shooting in San Bernardino to call for a total ban on Muslim immigration. Before the smoke had even cleared in Brussels following bombings that left dozens dead in March, Trump was on Fox News using the attacks to call for the Mexican border to be closed, Muslims to be banned from entering the country, and terrorism suspects to be waterboarded. It took less than 12 hours for Trump to blame immigrants for the mass shooting at a gay nightclub in Orlando in June, despite the fact that the shooter turned out to be from New Jersey.
Clinton, by contrast, responded to the firebombing in North Carolina with a measured statement: A Gofundme campaign started by a Democrat quickly raised $13,000 for the Orange County GOP to reopen its office.
Meanwhile, Trump surrogate and Milwaukee County Sheriff David Clarke was on Fox News Monday morning making a case that blaming Democrats for the North Carolina firebombing is fair game, even without evidence, because “if a voter registration drive set up by the NAACP_—_an office was set up and firebombed, you know darn well that the rhetoric would come out that it was Donald Trump involvement, he’s responsible, Republicans are responsible, with no foundation, so for that to happen on the other side I think is legitimate.”
Clark, an elected law enforcement official, openly called for riots over the weekend to protest the “rigged” system he thinks Trump is up against."
100692,1010,Trump senior adviser defends Trump’s attacks on sexual assault accusers’ looks,https://thinkprogress.org/aj-delgado-defends-trump-attacks-sexual-assault-accusers-looks-66888d7f9389#.uljkwr7l1,25,"On Thursday and Friday, Donald Trump defended himself against sexual assault allegations by suggesting his accusers are too ugly for him.
“Take a look. You take a look,” Trump said on Thursday in reference to one accuser. “Look at her, look at her words, you tell me what you think. I don’t think so.”
Then, on Friday, in reference to another accuser, Trump said: “Believe me, she would not be my first choice, that I can tell you. Man, you don’t know, that would not be my first choice.” Studies have shown that sexual assault is about power, not just about sexual attraction, so Trump’s looks-shaming line of defense doesn’t hold up. But that didn’t stop Trump campaign senior adviser A.J. Delgado from trying to defend her boss on those grounds anyway.
During an appearance on MSNBC on Sunday night, Delgado argued that accusers’ appearances are relevant to discussion about the Trump sex assault allegations, because if an accuser isn’t in Trump’s league looks-wise, then Trump wouldn’t have been interested in sexually assaulting them in the first place.
“When you have somebody claiming that you sexually assaulted them, you’ve brought looks into the equation,” Delgado said.
Delgado, who is an attorney, went on to falsely claim Trump “hasn’t mentioned looks.”
“If somebody said, ‘A.J. was attracted to me and touched me in an inappropriate manner,’ it’s relevant to the discussion whether that person is the type of person that I would normally be attracted to,” she continued. “He hasn’t mentioned looks, but if he did, it would be germane to the discussion. I wouldn’t find that offensive.” A “Myths and Facts” page put together by the Sexual Assault Awareness and Prevention Center at the University of Michigan characterizes the notion that “rape is caused by the perpetrator’s uncontrollable sexual urge” as a myth.
Fact: Rape is an act of power and control, not sex.
In addition, one of the biggest myths about rape is that it happens out of sexual desire. Sexual assault is highly sexualized in our society due to the link between sex and violence prevalent in our culture. Many people have sexual desires, but not everyone commits sexual assault.
— Survivors of rape are not always those we would consider sexually attractive, such as children or the elderly.
— Most rapists have available sexual relationships.
— By making the issue about sex and not about violence, this crime seems more acceptable and less severe
— The rapist is allowed then to use the excuse that s/he was simply desiring sex, and just “took it too far”.
This mentality leads us to blame the victim and not hold the rapist accountable for his or her actions. Also, perpetrators of sexual assault often plan their crimes. Sexual assault is not simply a “crime of passion” where the perpetrator “loses control”. Rather, sexual assault is about power and control. The perpetrator exerts his or her power over the victim in such a way to take away any control the victim has in the sexual situation.
The recording of Trump bragging about sexually assaulting women released on October 7 fits this power dynamic. On the tape, Trump says that “when you’re a star they let you do it. You can do anything… grab them by the pussy. You can do anything.”
Trump has now been accused of sexual misconduct by at least 14 women."
100693,1010,This is everything Trump could come up with to disprove 10 accusations of sexual assault,https://thinkprogress.org/all-of-trumps-attempts-to-prove-he-never-touched-the-women-accusing-him-of-sexual-assault-a4b81d9c8338#.5ne461m2y,25,"Since the world heard Donald Trump bragging about assaulting women without consent in a leaked tape earlier this month, ten women and counting have come forward to share stories of being grabbed, kissed, and groped by the Republican nominee.
Trump and his surrogates have repeatedly denied all of the allegations. Trump has maintained that women are lying, explaining that they are too ugly for him to assault or that they are just seeking attention. His supporters say that it was just harmless “locker-room talk,” and that groping women without consent doesn’t “count” as sexual assault. As his campaign throws out any excuse that might stick, Trump has promised concrete evidence that will prove that he never touched any of the ten women.
Here is the “evidence” he has produced:
Jessica Leeds
Jessica Leeds told the New York Times last week that Trump reached over to touch her while she was seated next to him in the first class cabin of a flight in 1980. “He was like an octopus,” she said. “His hands were everywhere.”
Two days after she came forward with her allegations, the New York Post published what the Trump campaign claimed was “proof” that the incident never occurred. British man Anthony Gilberthorpe told the Post that he was “present at all times” in the first class cabin of the airplane with Trump and Leeds, and that the groping never occurred. He also claims that Leeds confessed to him that she wanted to marry Trump.
It’s unclear how one would remember every detail of a flight more than three decades later, or why Leeds would make a confession to a total stranger.
Gilberthorpe has also been caught lying to the press on multiple occasions.
Summer Zervos
Former Apprentice contestant Summer Zervos alleges that Trump inappropriately kissed and groped her at a Beverly Hills hotel.
Trump responded to her allegations in a Facebook post, claiming that he never touched her inappropriately. “In fact, Ms. Zervos continued to contact me for help, emailing my office on April 14th of this year asking that I visit her restaurant in California,” he wrote. The Trump campaign then released a statement in which Zervos’ cousin, John Barry, says Zervos “wishes she could still be on reality TV, and in an effort to get that back she’s saying all of these negative things about Mr. Trump.”
“Summer’s actions today are nothing more than an attempt to regain the spotlight at Mr. Trump’s expense,” he added.
But this weekend, Gloria Allred, Zervos’ attorney, fired back. In a press conference, she detailed text messages in which Barry called himself a “loser” who was fired from the family restaurant. Allred also presented an account that corroborates that the assault occurred_—_Zervos’ friend testified that she remembers Zervos confiding in her after the incident occurred in 2007.
Kristin Anderson
Kristin Anderson told the Washington Post that she was at a nightclub with Trump in the early 1990’s when he slid his fingers up her skirt and touched her through her underwear.
Trump has not provided evidence that it did not occur.
Jill Harth
Jill Harth alleges that in 1993 when she was working on a pageant, Trump pushed her against a wall and put his hands all over her. Her lawyers allege that it was an “attempted rape.”
Trump has not provided evidence that it did not occur.
Temple Taggart
Temple Taggart claims that Trump kissed her directly on the lips without consent when she was Miss Utah in 1997.
Trump has disputed her claim, saying he is reluctant to kiss strangers on the lips. But he has not provided evidence that it did not occur.
Cathy Heller
Cathy Heller told The Guardian that Trump kissed her on the lips during a Mother’s Day brunch at his Mar-a-Lago resort in 1997. “He took my hand, grabbed me, and went for the lips,” she said.
Trump has not provided evidence that it did not occur.
Mindy McGillivray
Mindy McGillivray alleges that she was groped by Trump at Mar-a-Lago in 2003 when she was 23 years old and working on a photo shoot.
Trump has not provided evidence that it did not occur.
Rachel Crooks
Rachel Crooks claims that Trump assaulted her outside the elevators of Trump Tower in New York. When she introduced herself to the real estate mogul, he kissed her directly on the mouth without consent.
Trump has not provided evidence that it did not occur.
Natasha Stoynoff
People magazine writer Natasha Stoynoff alleges that Trump pushed her against a wall at the Mar-a-Lago resort and forced his tongue down her throat.
Trump has not provided evidence that it did not occur.
Cassandra Searles
Cassandra Searles claims that she was groped by Trump during the 2013 Miss USA pageant. “He probably doesn’t want me telling the story about that time he continually grabbed my ass and invited me to his hotel room,” she wrote online.

100694,1001,Someone really is trying to rig the election—and he's a Republican,http://www.dailykos.com/stories/2016/10/18/1584068/-Someone-really-is-trying-to-rig-the-election-and-he-s-a-Republican#read-more,26,"Donald Trump likes to talk about rigged elections and voter fraud, but in Pennsylvania someone is going beyond just talk. They’re actively attempting to defraud voters. This image is just one of several circulating in Pennsylvania, and being passed along through Facebook and email. The problem, of course, is that Pennsylvania doesn’t have online voting. No state has online voting. This is an attempt to convince voters that they’ve already voted so they will stay home on Election Day.

And at least one person behind the fraud may already be known.

The site Billypenn has identified the author of one widely seen image.

… one Western Pennsylvania Republican official circulated an image claiming Pennsylvanians can vote online for Hillary Clinton.

The official, according to a screenshot of a Facebook post, is Murrysville City Councilman Joshua Lorenz. Lorenz, a Republican, was most recently elected in 2015 and his term runs through 2019. He also works for the Meyer Unkovic Scott law firm in Pittsburgh and is the vice president of the Murrysville City Council.
Lorenz, who is a lawyer, has since deleted his post from Facebook and Twitter. But the original image and related images are still circulating.  “My friends understood the spirit which was intended,” [Lorenz] said. “This was clearly a joke. It’s a farce. It’s not exactly the only joke or farce going around on Facebook this election.”
The “spirit” of the post seems far from clear, especially when Lorenz went out of his way to avoid creating any confusion for Trump voters, and circulated the image on the two largest social media platforms. This event is currently being investigated by the Pennsylvania’s attorney general.

In previous years, it has not been uncommon for groups or individuals to circulate false information. This has included false polling stations, information that will cause absentee ballots to be spoiled, and even false dates for elections. This misinformation has been circulated online, in flyers, and by phone calls.

As we get closer to Nov. 8, it’s likely that Mr. Lorenz won’t be the only person making such “jokes” about the 2016 election."
100695,1001,New DSCC polling catches Senate Republicans between a rock and a hard place over abandoning Trump,http://www.dailykos.com/stories/2016/10/18/1583634/-New-DSCC-polling-catches-Senate-Republicans-between-a-rock-and-a-hard-place-over-abandoning-Trump,26,"Republican Senate candidates have certainly been fretting over whether or not to finally abandon Donald Trump after he was caught on tape bragging about sexual assault. Among those in tough races, some like Sen. Richard Burr have stuck by him, others like Sen. Pat Toomey have equivocated, while those like Sen. Kelly Ayotte have finally ditched him. However, new polling from the DSCC shows voters in Nevada, New Hampshire, North Carolina, and Pennsylvania are ready to punish Republicans no matter what they do. While continuing to support Trump is a liability with most voters, Trump’s steadfast fanatics see Republicans who abandon him as a stab in the back and are willing to return the favor. After Republicans like Ayotte stood with Trump despite his long history of awfulness—she even called him a role model in a debate two weeks ago—many voters now seem to believe that disavowing Trump only now reeks of political opportunism rather than genuine principle.

The DSCC’s numbers, which mirror surveys taken for House Democrats last week, show a damned-if-they-do, damned-if-they-don’t scenario for Republicans. This latest polling finds that informing voters of the Republican Senate candidate’s stance on Trump lowered that candidate’s margin between 4 and 6 percent—regardless of what that stance is.

Making things even more precarious for Republicans, they’ve spent so much effort on early ads while Team Blue, by contrast, planned for a late blitz. That's left Democrats poised to outspend the GOP on the airwaves in the final weeks in several states, giving them the means with which to educate voters about exactly where Republicans stand on Trump. And that could make all the difference between Majority Leader Mitch McConnell remaining in power, or Sen. Chuck Schumer taking over with a new Democratic majority. "
100696,1001,Six witnesses back up People magazine writer's claim of sexual assault by Donald Trump,http://www.dailykos.com/stories/2016/10/18/1584028/-Six-witnesses-back-up-People-magazine-writer-s-claim-of-sexual-assault-by-Donald-Trump,26,"Former People magazine writer Natasha Stoynoff has produced six witnesses who say she told them about Donald Trump “pushing me against the wall and forcing his tongue down my throat” shortly after the attack happened. Not only that, but one can directly contradict Melania Trump’s claims in her threatened lawsuit. (Because of course the Trumps are threatening to sue.)

Stoynoff asked to be reassigned from covering the Trumps, reasonably enough considering that, again, Donald pushed her against a wall and forced his tongue down her throat. But she didn’t go public because, as her former journalism professor says, “I advised her not to say anything, because I believed Trump would deny it and try to destroy her.”

While Donald Trump is denying that the entire incident ever happened, his wife has demanded a retraction of a very specific part of the story. Stoynoff writes that she ran into Melania Trump on the street some time after the assault and Melania asked “why don’t we see you anymore?” Melania’s lawyers claim that “At the time in question, Mrs. Trump would not have even recognized Ms. Stoynoff if they had encountered one another on the street,” citing Stoynoff’s claim as an actionable false statement. Because “I ran into his wife on the street the year after he assaulted me” is the problematic part of Stoynoff’s story. But Stoynoff was with a friend at the time, who corroborates her account of Melania being friendly. (Also, if Melania Trump doesn’t remember and be friendly with the reporters who write major feature stories on her for popular magazines, she is not doing her job as Donald Trump’s wife.)

Stoynoff’s friends have better memories:

“She was very upset and told me how he shoved her against a wall,” says [People east coast editor Liz] McNeil.

She adds, “The thing I remember most was how scared she was. I felt I had to protect her.”
By coming forward with her story, Stoynoff is helping to protect the country from Donald Trump.

100697,1002,"Prof. John Banzhaf: Yes, the Election Can Be Rigged",http://www.breitbart.com/2016-presidential-race/2016/10/18/prof-john-banzhaf-yes-election-can-rigged/,26,"There’s suddenly a great deal of discussion about the possible rigging of the forthcoming presidential election.  Donald Trump has argued that it can be rigged – perhaps that it is being rigged – although he seems short on specifics or evidence.
In response, many – including some in the media as part of their “fact checking” role – are trying to assure the public that the election cannot possibly be rigged; that any claims that such a thing might even be possible are “false” or “not true.”

Quite apart from the fact that it is usually impossible to prove a negative, these reassurances seem to be false.  Election computers have already been hacked, other hacking has resulted in the release of documents quite capable of affecting the election, both federal and state officials are taking steps aimed a preventing such interference, and a few professors and others have shown how easily such an event could occur.

Although I was hacking as far back as the 1950s, and created a computer technique for determining the chance that any small group of voters could change the outcome of a presidential election – now called “The Banzhaf Index” – which has been widely adopted and utilized, I certainly don’t ask you to take my word for it.  On the contrary, the evidence very briefly outlined below shows that it is possible (although clearly not probable) for an election to be hacked. Considering the enormous consequences if it were to actually (or even apparently) occur, we must accept the fact that it is true, in the same sense that it is true (although again not probable) that our electric distribution system, airplane flight control system, banking systems, etc. could be hacked.

Moreover, while it may be difficult for hackers to actually change the outcome of the election, it is at least possible – in the same sense that many responsible people now agree that computer experts might be able to hack into the nation’s banking system, electricity distribution control system, air transit systems, etc.; as they have with so many major governmental organizations and powerful corporations.

Perhaps more importantly, a hack could easily cast significant doubt on the validity of the election even if the election result wasn’t in fact changed, especially if the losing nominee and/or his supporters voice suspicion concerning the outcome, and thus help to undermine the faith of many citizens in the entire election process.  Indeed, some 40% of the public, according to a recent survey, are deeply skeptical about the integrity of the nation’s election apparatus.

Note that if some election results appears suspicious, or only a few voting machines display clearly exaggerated results, or if the word “hacked” or a picture of Guy Fawkes appears on the screens of a few computers used to compile votes, disappointed voters could become very upset.

Here’s just some of the evidence that rigging/hacking the forthcoming election is possible.

* According to NBC news and other media sources, the CIA is currently preparing to launch an unprecedented cyber war against Russia as retaliation for what has now been clearly identified as attempted Russian interference in the forthcoming U.S. presidential election.  This definitely includes the recent hacking of the election systems in Arizona and Illinois, and probably the release of emails damaging to Democrats for which Russia is also believed to be responsible.

* Also, Homeland Security Secretary Jeb Johnson is considering designating election systems around the country as a “critical infrastructure” in need of federal assistance and protection, and has already established an Election Infrastructure Cybersecurity Working Group, as well as launching a Voting Infrastructure Cybersecurity Action Campaign.

* Meanwhile, an anonymous Homeland Security Department official reportedly said that the voter systems of more than 20 states – including the key state of Florida – have been targeted by hackers just in recent months.

* The FBI’s reported that the data bases of election boards in at least two states were successfully hacked, apparently by foreign governments, and in at least one case the hackers were able to insert malicious software into the system.  Moreover, their report showed that both infiltrations were done using common off-the-shelf software programs readily available to anyone who wants them from the Internet. In other words, hacking election machines can be done not only by hostile governments and master computer experts, but also by common garden-variety hackers.

* Just weeks after the release of a report showing how easy it would be for Russians or even high school nerds to hack a presidential election, two other professors have just proven it.  University of Michigan Professor Alex Halderman was able to infiltrate a voting system from 500 miles away, and, in another demonstration, manipulate voting results with only a screwdriver and some memory chips.  Princeton professor Andrew Appel was able to hack an election machine in only 7 minutes.

* According to an official from the Department of Homeland Security, 25 states have reached out for federal aid related to election security, and DHS Secretary Jeh Johnson said he hopes more will seek assistance.

* CNN reluctantly reports that “we’ve officially entered the era of the hackable [presidential] election.”

* Mother Jones reports that “the concern that somebody might try to hack voting machines no longer seems outlandish.”

* Politico says a computer expert remarked that if some of the more susceptible voting machines hadn’t yet been hacked, “it was only because no one tried.”

* Money magazine says we’ve officially entered the era of the hackable election.

* Wired claims that the move toward electric voting machines turned out to be a “technological train wreck.”

*ABC News featured a piece entitled “Yes, It’s Possible to Hack the Election.”

* Tarrant County, Texas, is now investigating voter fraud through the use of mail-in ballots.

Despite the lack of real support or substantiation for the claims Trump is making about a rigged election, all of the above is more than ample reason to believe that many recent developments now make elections subject to being hacked, if not rigged.

These include the increased use of electronic voting machines (especially where they leave no paper trail), that more and more computers and data processing devices used in the election process are connected to the Internet, and that some states permit residents to cast their votes over the Internet.

Also, under our Electoral College system, any rigging or hacking which resulted in a change in even a very small number of votes, and perhaps even only a small number of votes in one individual state, could change the outcome of the presidential election, something very unlikely to occur were there to be a direct nationwide presidential election.

In this regard remember how the 2000 presidential election was decided by fewer than 1000 votes out of almost 6 million cast in Florida; so a hack of as little as 550 votes could have resulted in a different president.

In short, even a very small probability that an election could be hacked, just like the small possibility that hackers could disable our power supply, airline system, etc. must be taken seriously and reported to the public, considering the gravity of the harm which would be caused.

Indeed, the risk of a hacked or rigged election might be even greater. Power and airline systems which have been hacked should be able to be fixed and back to normal shortly, but damage to the faith of citizen in their voting systems would have long lasting effects.

In summary, while I do not support, in the absence of any hard evidence, that the forthcoming election has already been rigged for or against any party or any candidate, or that any such rigging is likely or even probable in the near future, we should be wary of even the very small probability of an election hack.

To paraphrase a well-known James Bond movie: “Never Say Never.”"
100698,1002,Hillary Clinton’s Texas Ad Buy Fuels Speculation,http://www.breitbart.com/texas/2016/10/18/hillary-clintons-texas-ad-buy-fuels-speculation/,26,"Democrat presidential candidate Hillary Clinton has recently dropped some money on advertising in the historically red Lone Star State and doing so has fueled speculation.
The ad buy for one week is small in presidential campaign terms, especially if you want to make an impact in a state the size of Texas.

VIDEO: SOLDIERS ORDERED TO RETURN BONUSES

No Democrat has won a presidential election in Texas since 1976 when Texans voted for Jimmy Carter. Mitt Romney carried the State in 2012 with 4,569,843 votes to President Barack Obama’s 3,308,124. John McCain won by close to the same numbers in 2008. The State Legislature is dominated with Republican seats.

Clinton plopped down $1oo,000 by Tuesday, and she will be spending that money in Austin, Dallas, Houston, and San Antonio, reported The Texas Tribune.

The Democrat nominee is targeting large urban cities in Texas that are either politically blue, or are trending purple, like Houston.

Although there has been much-to-do by those on the other side of the red aisle about Democratic chances in the State, as well as the meaning of the ad purchase, part of the political optimism of the Democratic hopeful, is the fact that The Dallas Morning News endorsed Clinton. The paper has not endorsed a Democrat for president in 75 years.

Her supporters are tweeting the ad in which Clinton quotes from and touts the Morning News endorsement: The Dallas paper published an editorial on September 7th endorsing the Democrat presidential nominee. Those wishful-thinkers should look at the consequences to the publication which became evident in the weeks thereafter.

Breitbart Texas reported on September 21st that The Dallas Morning News had taken a hit in subscriptions after its early September endorsement of Clinton.

“Certainly we’ve paid a price for our presidential recommendation, but then, we write our editorials based on principle, and sometimes principle comes at a cost,” The Dallas Morning News Editor Mike Wilson told Poynter. 

The DMN editor added, “I’ve had a lot of conversations with readers lately, and I respect their views and their right to disagree with us. The most important thing to us is that they vote, even if it’s not for our favorite candidate, because democracy doesn’t work if people don’t vote.”

After the endorsement, angry protestors convened outside the DMN building in Dallas. Wilson approached them and he was asked “How could we support known criminal/liar/killer @Hillary Clinton?” One of the protestors called the Dallas editor an “enemy of the state.” Another protestor accused the newspaper of taking “big money” for the endorsement.

Polling in Texas shows that Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump is ahead in the State. Real Clear Politics puts Trump ahead with an average of the polls at 44.0 percent to Clinton’s 38.3 percent.

Clinton has a lot of money to spend and she just put another $2 million down in Arizona, another historically red state, reported the Tribune.

In late August, the Democratic candidate raised $18 million in just a three-day swing through California. She raked in nearly $70 million in June, as reported by Breitbart News. Republican nominee Trump also had a good month, raising $51 million in June. He raised $37 million in July, and as reported, 64 percent of this came from small-dollar donors. Clinton raised $63 million, with only 36 percent of the donations coming from donations under $200. Trump’s campaign and the Republican National Committee (RNC) raised $64 million in July and had nearly $80 million on hand, reported Breitbart News.

As reported by Breitbart News on September 1st, the Clinton campaign has spent $77 million on television ads. The Trump campaign had spent only $5 million by that time.

While Clinton has raised money from celebrities, billionaires, and political action committees, and Trump has also received large donations from the very wealthy, the Trump campaign set a fundraising record for raising $5 million in small donations in just one day, reported Breitbart News. The donations under $200 were made online and this amount did not include donations made by mail or over the phone. Billionaire globalist George Soros has given at least $11.9 million to Clinton.

President Barack Obama will be in Beverly Hills for a $100,000 per person fundraiser for Clinton on October 24th, as reported by Breitbart News."
100699,1002,"CNN’s Dan Merica: Nothing to See in Wikileaks, Hillary Clinton’s Private Speech Transcripts",http://www.breitbart.com/big-journalism/2016/10/18/cnns-dan-merica-wikileaks-hillary-clinton-private-speech-transcripts/,26,"CNN reporter Dan Merica would like you to think that there is nothing to see in Wikileaks’ release of emails from Hillary Clinton’s campaign chairman John Podesta — including the transcripts of her private paid speeches.
In a Tuesday article co-bylined with Tal Kopan bearing the vanilla headline “What we’ve learned from the hacked emails of Hillary Clinton’s campaign (so far),” Merica’s main takeaway from the leaked emails and campaign documents is how hard-working and “methodical” Clinton appears. Nothing about scandals. Nothing about the troubling internal audit of the Clinton Foundation. Just a boring look at an impressively “deliberate” campaign. There is a word for this type of news story.

VIDEO: LIBERAL VOTING MACHINES

Merica is a CNN Politics producer and has covered Clinton on the campaign trail since the Democratic primary. His name is seen several times in the Podesta emails, suggesting a friendly, if not collaborative, relationship with Clinton and her staff.

In September of 2015, Nick Merrill, Clinton’s traveling press secretary, was supposed to call Merica call Merica ahead of his writeup of an interview remark from Clinton, according to the campaign’s Director of Communications Jennifer Palmieri. “Nick is calling dan Mercia [sic] who tweeted aboit it,” she wrote.

Merrill described a chummy exchange between Merica and Clinton in February 2016: “Dan Merica asked her if she was jealous that she didn’t get [Chris] Christie’s endorsement, to which she responded with a prolonged smile (you could see the gears turning), and then said ‘Dan, I really like you. I really really like you.’ They are basically courting each other at this point.”

Merica RSVPed “yes” to an off-the-record dinner at Podesta’s New York home which took place three days before Clinton’s campaign launch.

In Tuesday’s explainer, Merica and Kopan declare that “secret transcripts of Clinton’s paid speeches behind closed doors on Wall Street have failed to turn up any positions widely different than what she says in public.”

A cursory look at Wikileaks news coverage shows this idea is false. Here are just a few issues Merica and Kopan overlook:

ON TRADE: The article makes no mention of international trade deals such as the Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPP) and the Trade Promotion Authority (TPA), a bill to “fast track” executive authority to negotiate those kinds of deals. Breitbart News’ Matthew Boyle and Charlie Spiering reported on the Clinton campaign’s reluctant move to imitate Bernie Sanders’ populist opposition to TPP, though Clinton was on record saying the prospective deal “set the gold standard in trade agreements.”

[H]er campaign manager Robby Mook [admits] that Hillary Clinton would not be “comfortable” coming out against TPP during the campaign, even though she had to do it for votes.

…

A previous email exchange in March 2015 detailed how Clinton’s staff believed she intended to support both TPA and TPP. The email from her lead speechwriter [Dan Schwerin] makes it very clear: The draft letter he was circulating “assumes that she’s ultimately going to support both TPA and TPP.”

In one of Clinton’s private speeches, she told Brazil’s Banco Itaú, “My dream is a hemispheric common market, with open trade and open borders.” This directly contradicts Clinton’s official immigration policy page’s promise to “protect our borders and national security.” More disturbingly, that admission contradicts the implicit promise of her candidacy. Her long-term agenda would mean surrendering the sovereignty of the nation she hopes to govern.

ON MONEY IN POLITICS: Clinton released a policy memo in 2015 to reform and strongly enforce campaign finance laws:

Americans are understandably cynical about a political system that has been hijacked by billionaires and special interests who will spend whatever it takes to crowd out the voices of everyday Americans. And with the rise of unlimited, secret spending in our political process, it is virtually impossible for anyone to really know who or what is influencing our elected officials. On issues from climate change to equal pay and immigration reform, voters won’t believe Washington will work for them unless we take on the power and stranglehold that wealthy interests have over our political system.

…

Finally, for our campaign finance system to have meaning, Clinton believes we must vigorously enforce our campaign finance laws. [emphasis original]

On both counts, Wikileaks shows Clinton contradicting this position privately. On the first point, a “flag” from Clinton’s speeches in a campaign memo reads: “Hillary Clinton Said Politicians Treat NYC Like An ATM And ‘Political Givers’ Need To Tell Politicians ‘Here Are Things I Want You To Do For The Country.'” On enforcing campaign finance laws, Hillary for America’s top staffers openly and often discuss how they can “coordinate” with friendly Super PACs wielding much larger war chests from donors.

ON TRANSPARENCY: Clinton’s inner circle contradicted Clinton’s public explanations of an unsecured homebrew email server through which she conducted all her business as Secretary of State — in apparent violation of federal records keeping laws. As Clinton insisted publicy that she had turned over all work-related emails, Podesta himself asks about withholding messages to and from President Obama after Congress subpoenaed Clinton’s emails.

And in a paid speech, Clinton admitted that as a politician, “you need both a public and a private position.” This may seem like a point so obvious it does not even need to be spoken, but the obvious implication undercuts CNN’s thesis — that Clinton’s public and private beliefs are consistent.

A massive portion of the Podesta emails are spent organizing phone calls. What we see even in campaign memos and speeches, even emails, is still filtered by the knowledge that people could see this content who are not meant to see it. The public is still far from understanding the “real” Hillary Clinton. For instance, an FBI interview released on Monday suggests that the kind, soft-spoken grandmother persona which Clinton projects to the public is nothing like the Clinton that her security agents see.

Finally, Merica and Kopan remind their readers that revelations from the Podesta emails “have been overshadowed by Clinton’s opponent, Donald Trump, and the release of a hot-mic recording of Trump bragging about sexually aggressive behavior.”

Perhaps in their social circles, yes, but the public’s interest in Wikileaks greatly eclipses establishment journalists’ interest in Trump. And they will likely ignore attempts, like this article’s, to proclaim “nothing to see here.”"
100700,1003,Trump’s Campaign is Dead (and Alive?),http://www.huffingtonpost.com/ryancasey/the-election-is-overand-t_b_12468314.html?utm_hp_ref=politics,26,"There should be no doubt by now that the 2016 election is over, and Hillary Clinton will be the next President of the United States. But because the votes won’t actually be tabulated and the results announced until sometime around 11 p.m. EST on November 8, Donald Trump exists in what physicists would call a state of quantum superposition: both politically doomed—and still alive—all at once.

This presidential race has officially achieved the full Schrödinger’s Cat.

For the non-physics nerds out there, Erwin Schrödinger is considered one of the fathers of quantum physics, and he won the Nobel Prize in 1933. He is best known for a thought experiment meant to illustrate the difficulty of taking ideas from the quantum world (which involve sub-microscopic particles like electrons and photons) and applying them to our macro world of everyday things. In the quantum world, particles can exist in multiple states, in multiple positions, at the same time. These particles behave more like waves, which can spread out over space and don’t really conform to our macro intuitions about the tangible objects we regularly see and touch.

It makes sense that we would have trouble conceiving of the quantum world; after all, humans evolved as a species to think on a macro scale, finding food and avoiding saber-toothed tigers. Imaginative thinking about quantum physics probably wasn’t real useful on the African savannah.

But Mr. Schrödinger dreamed up a thought experiment involving a cat that could be simultaneously both alive and dead to explain the state of quantum superposition. In the scenario, a steel box contains a cat, a glass bottle of poisonous hydrogen cyanide, and a radioactive source. A Geiger counter measures the radioactive decay of the substance, which then triggers a hammer that breaks the bottle containing the cyanide, killing the cat. The radioactive decay is a random process, and without looking inside the box, we’re left only to ponder whether the cat is dead or alive at any given moment. Until we actually open the box to check, we have to assume the cat is, as Schrödinger put it, “living and dead . . . in equal parts.”

The factors that will determine the outcome of this election are not random, but Trump’s candidacy is both living and dead simultaneously. Even before The Washington Post made public the Access Hollywood tape on October 7 that sent Trump’s campaign into free fall, Hillary Clinton enjoyed a wide lead in the Electoral College that all but guaranteed her victory. Sam Wang’s meta-margin model at Princeton Election Consortium currently pegs Clinton’s probability of winning at 98 percent—practically a lock in the world of statistics. And for all of the craziness surrounding the Trump freak show, this has been the most stable race in the 65-year history of modern polling. Even without the shoes that continue to drop surrounding Trump’s sexual assault allegations, polling deviations in his favor outside the historical variance are extremely unlikely with less than one month to go.

Still, much like Schrödinger’s Cat, many political observers have trouble grasping how an election can already be over even before a majority of voters actually cast their ballots. But a presidential general election is not like a football game, in which one team may be a heavy favorite but theoretically anything can happen between opening kickoff and the final whistle. A better analogy is a baking cake, which is the culmination of a process over time, as ingredients are mixed and heated, ultimately determining the flavor of the final result.

If the extensive data available suggested a close race between Clinton and Trump, the outcome might still be in doubt. But the assortment of factors and chain of events that will lead to Hillary Clinton’s election on November 8 have been baking into the cake all along, from fundamentals like the state of the economy, the demographics of the American electorate, and President Obama’s approval ratings, to perceptions of the political parties and the candidates, including major issues, events, and news stories.

Despite Hillary’s data-based good news, many Democrats seem determined to find reasons for bed-wetting. Fear of complacency seems to be the prevailing worry, and it arises from the common—but flawed—intuition people have about who votes and why. As the thinking goes, all of Trump’s voters are diehard zealots, foaming at the mouth. Hillary’s supporters, meanwhile, might see too many of their friends’ confident Facebook posts and decide to stay home on Election Day.

But this intuition assumes people vote only out of a hyper-rational calculation that the entire election might hinge on their single vote. It also assumes there are no fair-weather Republican voters who might not go to the trouble of voting for an obviously doomed candidate. But while it is true that some voters might be guided by hyper-rational calculations like this, a growing body of research from behavioral scientists in academia and on behalf of campaigns sheds new light on what makes people vote. In 2012, the Obama campaign put its state-of-the-art analytics capabilities to maximum use, conducting endless experiments among supporters and potential voters to test fundraising pitches, tailor persuasive messages, and mobilize voters.

It turns out the hyper-rational calculation is merely one of myriad reasons why Americans bother to vote at all, despite the fact that voting takes at least some effort and is not mandated by law. In reality, all kinds of factors motivate people to vote—fear, anger, hope, elevation, solidarity. And the bandwagon effect—the chance to be on board the party train with the winner—is forceful.

In this presidential election, approximately 130 million Americans will vote. The variation on turnout will be on the margins, and that’s where campaigns fight. But as Mitch Stewart, Obama’s 2012 battleground states coordinator, explained, “The dirty secret of presidential elections is that a lot of people vote. You don’t have to remind them.”

Few insiders probably understand the results and implications of the Obama campaign’s behavioral studies better than David Plouffe, the architect of the 2008 and 2012 operations. In numerous interviews, Plouffe has not been at all shy about expressing his supreme confidence in Hillary, boldly putting her odds of winning at 100 percent.

Of course, as Trump’s poll numbers crater and new sexual assault allegations emerge, he may yet end his state of quantum superposition and quit the race in a fit of sour grapes. Trump insists he’ll see it through to the bitter end, but we should put about as much stock in that as we do with anything else that comes out of his mouth. Which is, not much. But at this moment in time, we can be certain about one thing: Trump is a dead cat walking."
100701,1003,America’s Bigotry and Hate Speech Problem Can’t Be Ignored,http://www.huffingtonpost.com/eric-yaverbaum/americas-bigotry-and-hate_b_12496106.html?utm_hp_ref=politics,26,"In an age where being politically correct and standing up for social justice are seen as weaknesses, those that are victims of social injustice are often berated with slurs, insults, and threats through social media. Twitter, which considers itself the “free speech wing of the free speech party,” has come under fire from both ends of the political spectrum (for simultaneously doing too much and too little to police hate speech on its platform).

This summer, conservative writer Milo Yiannopoulos’ attacks on SNL and Ghostbusters 2016 star Leslie Jones were well documented. While Twitter decided to permanently ban Yiannopoulos for his racist and sexist comments against Jones, this response did little to slow down the hateful army of the “alt-right” - an aggressive group of conservative racist nationalists. Those informed on the incident regardless of political leaning will tell you that removing abusers and instigators like Yiannopoulos is not enough to stop hate speech. While the alt-right rally behind those like Yiannopoulos - decrying that Twitter is no longer a beacon of free speech - most decent human beings plead with Twitter to do more to combat the pervasive and overtly racist and misogynistic hate speech that runs rampant on its platform.

Twitter has said that it is committed to updating its software to both detect abuse and make reporting it easier. The problem is, Twitter’s abuse system already relies too much on reporting from its users, and most people feel that Twitter does not do enough when abuse actually is reported. Indeed, previous Twitter updates have done little to remedy the situation and have even been criticized for minimizing the seriousness of online abuse by seemingly portraying it as nothing more than a minor annoyance. Twitter’s “Rules” state that “You may not promote violence against or directly attack or threaten other people on the basis of race, ethnicity, national origin, sexual orientation, gender, gender identity, religious affiliation, age, disability, or disease.” While the policy itself sounds like a step in the right direction, with no concrete enforcements, it amounts to nothing more than mere words.

Public divisiveness is common for election years, but the 2016 election (complete with a reality star and real-estate tycoon leading a campaign of hate and fear-mongering) has added plenty more fuel to this dumpster fire of an online political landscape. Indeed, the past year has been one marred by disturbingly racist, xenophobic, sexist, misogynistic, homophobic, and transphobic attacks, much of which found its footing on Twitter. It was on Twitter where Leslie Jones was berated with abhorrently racist and misogynistic attacks simply for having the gaul to be a successful black woman. Twitter was also home to the racist attacks hurled at 49ers quarterback Colin Kaepernick for the apparent crime of bringing attention to our country’s institutionalized racism and our severe need to reevaluate how black men and women are treated in America. Twitter also served as host for racially-charged hatred spewed at Malia Obama (for being a black woman who was accepted in Harvard), antisemitic threats and images tweeted at a New York Times Editor, and of course violent misogyny and rape threats directed at not only a feminist columnist for The Guardian, but at her 5-year old daughter as well. The hatred taking root on Twitter is abundant and seemingly unending - just this past week, Anderson Cooper (the first openly gay moderator of a presidential debate) was bombarded with homophobic insults and slurs on Twitter. And that’s just a small handful of some of the year’s more high-profile cases - these incidents represent a very small number of the never-ending hatred that seems to run rampant on Twitter. It can be very difficult to express any facet of a liberal opinion online, let alone dare to be a person of color, a woman, a non-Christian, or a member of the LGBTA community. Even the most benign and seemingly apolitical tweets run the risk of opening oneself up to hatred, abuse, and even threats of physical violence.

It’s clear, Twitter needs to effectively address its hate speech problem. It should go without saying, but the alleged preservation of free speech cannot be used to justify pure and unadulterated hatred and bigotry (i.e., free speech ought not permit unmitigated abuse and threats). Indeed, spewing hatred and threats of violence in order to silence the opinions of others is in itself antithetical to the very tenets of free speech (and anyone claiming to support free speech while using it to silence others is both a hypocrite and a danger to meaningful dialogue and free and open expression itself).

Aside from an appeal for basic moral decency, although Twitter likes to proport itself as a haven for free expression, it is a private company that can quite frankly limit speech however it sees fit - it has no obligation whatsoever to protect free speech. Everyone who uses Twitter must first agree to its terms of service, which despite widespread misconceptions and a gross lack of comprehension of the application of The Bill of Rights, are not in any way bound by the First Amendment (which only protects the right to articulate opinions and ideas without fear of government reprisal and prohibits the enacting of any law that would interfere with that right). Let me just say this again for those in the back - the First Amendment applies to the government and its enaction of laws, not individuals, not private companies. Twitter can therefore create its own rules regarding hate speech. That said, if Twitter wants to continue to be a platform where anyone can freely express their views, then it actually ought to start standing by its users and seriously reevaluate how it handles hate speech (and particularly those users who launch assaults, join in on attacks, and threaten others for simply speaking their mind). Indeed, if Twitter continues to allow unrestricted hate speech to permeate its platform, then it will undoubtedly fail to be the free speech mecca it claims to be. With it continuing to prioritize hateful abuse over those actually being abused (for simply trying to express their ideas), it should come as no surprise that many are leaving Twitter altogether.

Although 2016 has beared witness to a critical mass of bigotry and hate speech (with much of it festering on Twitter), it’s important to remember that this is not limited to Twitter and is not a new issue, nor is it one that will simply slip back under the surface and fade into irrelevancy. If there is one thing the past year has made abundantly clear, it’s that our attitudes toward one another need a massive overhaul. Speech is never just speech - it’s unfortunately an accurate reflection of the longstanding and deep-seated hatred and violence that still pervades our society (i.e., deeply-ingrained racism, sexism, misogyny, xenophobia, homophobia, and transphobia).

Hatred underlies the prevailing attitudes of millions of Americans. While many of us may have been able to comfortably dismiss our country’s rampant bigotry as a problem of the past and nothing more than the views of a few backwards individuals, that is no longer an option any moral actor can take. Hillary Clinton may be leading by double digits in the polls and might be guaranteed victory this November, but the Trump campaign has irrevocably emboldened and amplified a once whispered bigotry into one that is shouted and impossible to drown out. The toxicity (the deeply disturbing and most hateful qualities of our nation) has risen from the depths to the surface, and we simply cannot go back to pretending it does not exist. We need to deal with it.

We need to educate Americans on why social issues matter, why they should care about people that look, worship, or love differently than them, and we desperately need to learn empathy as a nation."
100702,1003,Why Faith Leaders Can’t Ignore This Election,http://www.huffingtonpost.com/marie-alfordharkey/why-faith-leaders-cant-ig_b_12545970.html?utm_hp_ref=politics&ir=Politics,26,"Sexuality has become a central issue in this election. As a pastor and faith leader, I believe that people of faith must work toward sexual health and justice in faith communities and in society. Silence in the face of injustice is simply not an option — especially during an election. Our faith calls us to respond to the suffering caused by the oppression of people because of their gender, sexuality, or reproductive decisions.

Sadly, there are many public theologians who have put forward a very different message this election season. Representing a shrinking if vocal minority of religious people, these faith leaders manipulate religion and sacred texts to exclude or attack anyone they deem sinful — stigmatizing the ways they love, how they identify, or the reproductive decisions they’ve made. In a national tour called “Decision America,” Franklin Graham has traveled across the country rallying conservative evangelical Christians around this election. Only a few days after my ordination this summer, I made my way to the Connecticut stop on Graham’s tour. I went to join other LGBTQ Christians in a peaceful demonstration at the state capitol, and as I neared the crowds of Graham’s supporters, I began to feel anxious. Usually, religious spaces feel like home to me, but I felt that my tattoos and nose ring marked me as obviously queer and an outsider at this gathering.

As Graham began to speak, urging the crowd to vote with their “Christian values,” calling on the United States to confess “the sins” of abortion and same-sex marriage, I felt transported to the conservative Christian tradition of my upbringing and the all-too-familiar rhetoric of sin, blame, and judgement. It was painful to hear him call my marriage a sin and to be in the company of so many who agreed.

I felt this way despite knowing that same-sex marriage is legal, despite the fact that many faith traditions celebrate same-sex couples, and despite my belief that same-sex marriage (including my own) is not a sin but a blessing. As I stood in that a crowd of his supporters, Graham’s rhetoric and manipulation of religion stirred discomfort and fear within me. But my Christian faith teaches that God created the diversity of creation and called it good. I know and believe that sexual and gender diversity are not sins but gifts from God. I share this belief with many religious traditions, faith leaders, and people of faith. We honor the diversity of creation, including sexual and gender diversity, and affirm the moral agency of individuals to make their own decisions about their lives and their bodies.

We are a long-standing and growing movement of faith leaders, and we believe that using religion to justify discrimination and hatred violates central tenets of faith — including love of neighbor and care for the poor. We know the harm caused by faith leaders who call LGBTQ people sinful or exclude them from their communities. We encounter people who have been harmed by sexism, misogyny, and sexual assault in our daily life and work as religious professionals, and we weep with them as we promote healing and wholeness. Franklin Graham and others seek to hide hateful politics behind religion by advocating for conservative Christian supremacy in public life and for anti-sex, anti-LGBTQ, and anti-abortion policies. As a movement of religious leaders, our faith calls us to the creative and life-giving work of sexual, gender, and reproductive justice. This summer, thousands of faith leaders came together to put forward our vision for justice and reclaim the moral higher ground. Gathering together for a Moral Day of Action, we delivered the Higher Ground Moral Declaration to state legislatures across the country. In the declaration, we call for “the economic liberation of all people; ensuring every child receives access to quality education; healthcare access for all; criminal justice reform; and ensuring historically marginalized communities have equal protection under the law.”

We put forth religious values that uphold the common good and inform our commitment to sexual, gender, and reproductive justice. Our belief in “economic liberation” and “healthcare access” requires that everyone makes a living wage and has access to reproductive healthcare including abortion regardless of their income, employer, or geographic location. Addressing “criminal justice reform” means that no parent has to raise a child in fear that they will be hurt or killed. Ensuring that “historically marginalized communities have equal protection under the law” means that LGBTQ people are no longer targeted by laws that legalize discrimination. Rooted in love, it is from our faith that we took action for justice. It is because we love our neighbors and are committed to caring for the poor that we issued this moral declaration and spoke out on these pressing social issues. Our hope is that our society will embody these values on every level—from the local to the national level.

As this election cycle has carried on, however, the opposition to the values of sexual, gender, and reproductive justice and to the systemic changes articulated in the Moral Higher Ground Declaration continues. In the wake of the release of a video that shows a presidential candidate discussing grabbing women’s genitals and kissing women without consent, it has become clear that some in the United States are not aware that these actions constitute sexual assault. Even some religious leaders have diminished the harm of sexual assault by asserting that “it’s only words,” ignoring the voices of women who have spoken out to contradict that claim. For many who have experienced sexual assault, this video and these tepid responses to it further the damage caused by their assault and serve as all too familiar reminders of our culture’s acceptance of sexual assault. In response, many people have begun to speak out against the pervasiveness of rape culture—sharing their own experiences of sexual assault, denouncing attempts normalize the video as “locker-room talk,” and declaring that sexual assault and rape culture are #notokay.

Sexual assault is never acceptable. It is always an affront to human dignity and to religious traditions’ highest commitment to ethical sexual expression. Just as we are called to care for all people, we must strive to be a country that heals the pain and brokenness caused by sexual assault, that listens and trusts the stories of survivors, and breaks down the systemic injustices that perpetuate rape culture. Our faith requires it.

As we face this historic election, it is crucial for faith leaders and communities to counter messages of exclusion, fear, and sexual oppression. People of faith must rally together to heal our country and lead the call for a more just society. This election season has called into question our deepest religious values of love for neighbor and freedom for all — inciting racism, sexism, misogyny, xenophobia, Islamophobia, and anti-immigrant sentiments at both the local and national level. These extreme responses emphasize the seriousness of the decision the American people will make on election day. The next president, legislators, state representatives, and local officials will be tasked with dealing with government stagnation and long term social, economic, and environmental challenges. Because of the vacancy on the Supreme Court, this election will impact recent and future judicial decisions on abortion access, LGBTQ rights, education, and voting rights.

Faith leaders have the opportunity and the responsibility to speak up for our religious values and to challenge hateful rhetoric. We have a moral obligation to help create social change that benefits all people (not just the strong, powerful, or wealthy) and to lend a moral voice to our future. We must not allow voices of hatred and division to speak for people of faith. We can change the conversation this election season. "
100703,1004,So It Turns Out The Trump Org's Email Servers Are Extremely Insecure,http://talkingpointsmemo.com/livewire/trump-uses-old-windows-servers,26,"Various Trump businesses' email servers use 13-year-old software whose manufacturer no longer issues security updates for them.

Put simply, that means Donald Trump has left lots of would-be private information accessible to nearly anyone with a basic understanding of computers.

“Running outdated software and operating systems for your publicly facing email infrastructure is problematic, especially when you're a high profile organisation,” security architect Kevin Beaumont, who first noticed the problem and posted about it on Twitter, told Motherboard on Monday.

For a candidate so focused on the cyber-security practices of his opponent, Hillary Clinton, Trump’s glaring web vulnerabilities are surprising.

Microsoft no longer issues security updates for the operating system the Trump Organization's email servers use—first released in 2003—and in 2015 the company ended tech support services for the operating system. An official webpage for the software urges its users: “Migration is worth it!”

“If you are still running Windows Server 2003 in your datacenter, you need to take steps now to plan and execute a migration strategy to protect your infrastructure,” the site says.

The operating system came bundled with IIS 6.0, a webserver software that similarly has not been supported since 2015, and that Beaumont told Motherboard is “particularly dangerous” to run without security updates.

In September, a security researcher for the MacKeeper software company also found a vulnerability in Trump’s campaign website which left intern resumes and other information open to view on the internet.

Responding to Motherboard's story, a Trump Organization spokesperson said: ""The Trump Organization deploys best in class firewall and anti-vulnerability technology with constant 24/7 monitoring. Our infrastructure is vast and leverages multiple platforms which are consistently monitored and upgraded using current cyber security best practices."""
100704,1004,Trump Calls For Term Limits For Congress,http://talkingpointsmemo.com/livewire/trump-calls-for-congress-term-limits,26,"Donald Trump offered a series of ethics reforms at a rally on Monday, including offering his support for a constitutional amendment requiring term limits for members of Congress.

“If I'm elected president I will push for a constitutional amendment to impose term limits on all members of congress. They've been talking about that for years,” Trump said to enthusiastic applause in Colorado Springs, Colorado. “Decades of failure in Washington and decades of special interest dealing must and will come to an end.”

Trump also launched into a series of limits on lobbyists and politicians, declaring “It is indeed time to drain the swamp in Washington D.C.”

Trump’s “package of ethics reforms” included five limitations on lobbyists, though he would only have the executive authority to carry out three of them, at most: a five-year ban on all executive branch officials lobbying the government after they leave public service, an expansion of the definition of lobbying to include “consultants” and “advisers”, and a lifetime ban on executive branch officials lobbying on behalf of foreign governments.

Two of Trump’s proposals—asking Congress to institute its own five year ban on lobbying by former members and their staffs, and asking Congress to pass a ban on foreign lobbyists raising money for political candidates—would require congressional approval.

Trump’s ethics reform push comes on the heels of WikiLeaks publishing a series of emails from Clinton’s campaign chairman, John Podesta, over the weekend, which revealed an internal debate among top Clinton aides over whether accepting campaign contributions bundled by foreign lobbyists was worth the perception of foreign influence on the presidential election.

“I’m ok just taking the money and dealing with any attacks,” Clinton’s campaign manager, Robby Mook, wrote.

“Take the money!!” agreed communications director Jennifer Palmieri.

Speaking of foreign influence: For months, Trump’s campaign has repeatedly solicited non-citizens—including many foreign lawmakers—for campaign contributions, despite numerous complaints filed with the Federal Election Commission that claim his campaign is in clear violation of the law."
100705,1004,Obama: Trump's 'Flattery' Of Putin Is 'Unprecedented'–And GOP Knows Better,http://talkingpointsmemo.com/livewire/obama-trump-putin-flattery,26,"President Obama on Tuesday said that Donald Trump's ""flattery"" of Russian President Vladimir Putin is ""unprecedented,"" and he called out Republicans who criticized the administration's approach to Russia and then turned around and endorse Trump's position on Putin.

""Mr. Trump's continued flattery of Mr. Putin and the degree to which he appears to model many of his policies and approaches to politics on Mr. Putin is unprecedented in American politics. And is out of step with not just what Democrats think, but out of step with what, up until the last few months, almost every Republican thought, including some of the ones who are now endorsing Mr. Trump,"" Obama said when asked about Trump's comments about Putin during a press conference with the Italian prime minister.

Obama laid out his administration's approach to Russia and noted that he has tried to work with Russia and Putin on ""common international challenges.""

The President said that in Syria, ""rather than to work with us to try to solve the problem, [Putin] doubled down on his support for Assad, and we know the situation that exists there.""

""So any characterization that somehow we have improperly challenged Russian aggression or have somehow tried to encroach on their legitimate interests is just wrong,"" Obama said.

He told reporters that he does not understand how ""some of the same leaders of the Republican Party who were constantly haranguing us for even talking to the Russians and who consistently took the most hawkish approaches to Russia, including Mr. Trump's selection for vice president, now reconcile their endorsement of Mr. Trump with their previous views.""

""The bottom line is, is that we think that Russia is a large, important country with a military that is second only to ours, and has to be a part of the solution on the world stage rather than part of the problem,"" Obama said. ""But their behavior has undermined international norms and international rules in ways that we have to call them out on, and anybody who occupies this office should feel the same way, because these are values that we fought for and we protected.""

Obama said that he's more surprised by Republican leaders' support for Trump than he is about Trump's praise of Putin.

""Mr. Trump rarely surprises me these days. I'm much more surprised and troubled by the fact that you have Republican officials who historically have been adamantly anti-Russian and, in fact, have attacked me for even engaging them diplomatically now supporting, and in some cases echoing, his positions,"" the President said. ""It's quite a reversal. You'll have to ask them how to explain it."""
100706,1005,"Obama Slams Trump's ""Whining"" About Rigged Election",http://www.motherjones.com/politics/2016/10/obama-slams-trumps-whining-about-rigged-election,26,"President Barack Obama denounced Donald Trump's warnings that the general election may be rigged against him and suggested the Republican nominee ""stop whining"" and instead focus on making ""his case to get votes.""

""I have never seen in my lifetime, or in modern political history, any presidential candidate trying to discredit the elections and the election process before votes have even taken place,"" Obama said at a press conference from the Rose Garden. ""It's unprecedented. It happens to be based on no facts.""

The president's sharp criticism follows repeated claims by Trump that the election on November 8 may have already been stolen from him. The real estate magnate has consistently floated theories about media coordination with the Clinton campaign and widespread voter fraud, while Clinton's lead has widened and new controversies hit his presidential campaign.


Trump's remarks have suggested that he may be planning to contest the results if Hillary Clinton wins. His running mate, however, has promised the Republican ticket will ""absolutely"" accept the outcome of the election."
100707,1005,This Video of a Black Man Arrested After Walking in the Street Is Going Viral,http://www.motherjones.com/politics/2016/10/edina-police-video-walking-handcuffed,26,"On October 12, a police officer was observed handcuffing a man who had been walking in the street in Edina, Minnesota. A video of the incident, captured by an observer and posted to YouTube, is now going viral online.

The video had more than 500,000 views by Tuesday morning and had spurred a response from the state chapter of the NAACP, the mayor of Edina, and the Edina Police Department. The bystander who filmed it was identified as Janet Rowles in a statement posted on Facebook by the Minnesota NAACP.

According to Rowles' summary of the incident, a man—identified as Larnie Thomas in the same NAACP statement—was walking along a white line that marked the shoulder of the road because the sidewalk on that side of the street was blocked off due to construction work. An unmarked police vehicle pulled in front of him, according to Janet's summary, blocking his path forward. The video begins after an officer in plain clothes has already detained Thomas, who is black, and is leading him by the coat jacket to his SUV. The officer was identified later as Tim Olson.

""Dude, damn!"" Thomas exclaims, clearly frustrated over the encounter.

""Come over here,"" the officer responds.

""For what?"" Thomas asks.

""You're walking down the middle of the street.""

""I'm on the damn white line!""

Thomas, who is clearly agitated at this point, repeatedly tells the officer to take his hands off him, insisting that he didn't do anything wrong.

The two arrive at the officer's SUV and a female voice off-screen—presumably Rowles'—suggests to the officer that he could have just told the man where to walk. Thomas, having tried repeatedly to pull away from the officer, concurs, to which the officer responds, ""We've gone beyond that just a little bit.""

Minutes later, a second police car arrives and an officer gets out to handcuff and arrest Thomas. Thomas complies, at this point having already removed his jacket and shirt in effort to break free of Olson's grip. ""You could have just shown him where to walk really kindly,"" the woman observing the incident calls out to the first officer. ""You are the one who incited this."" Then, a third officer approaches her to take her information.

Thomas was never taken to jail, but instead was released at a shopping mall upon his request, the mayor of Edina said in a statement. The citation against Thomas will be dropped, the Minneapolis Star Tribune reported Monday.

On Friday, the Edina Police Department posted a statement on Facebook saying that Olson had flashed his lights at Thomas after observing him walking ""in the southbound lane of traffic""; that Thomas ignored the police vehicle and walked around it; and that Thomas was ""defiant"" when Olson began to follow him down the street on foot. At that point, Olson smelled alcohol on Thomas' breath, according to the statement; a breathalyzer test confirmed that Thomas had consumed alcohol. Thomas's presence in the street was a threat to his and drivers' safety, police said.

But the NAACP and Rowles have wondered whether Thomas's stop was racially motivated. Edina—a town about 30 miles southwest of Minneapolis—is nearly 90 percent white. The Minnesota NAACP made a number of demands in response to the incident, including that the Edina Police Department re-train officers on implicit and explicit bias and begin to collect better demographic data on traffic stops. In a response, the police department said that a division of the Minnesota state police had launched an independent investigation into the incident, but that Olson and all other officers involved had followed ""established procedures."" It did, however, invite the NAACP to work with the department on developing reforms."
100708,1005,California Voters Were Hit With a Blizzard of Ballot Propositions. Here’s Your Cheat Sheet.,http://www.motherjones.com/politics/2016/10/kevin-drums-2016-guide-californias-ballot-initiatives,26,"This is a special post for California readers. The rest of you may safely ignore it.

This year we have 17 initiatives on the California ballot. As longtime readers know, my default position is to oppose all initiatives. Here's the nickel version of a longer rant about this: (1) Most initiatives these days are funded by corporate interests, not the grassroots, and corporate interests don't really need yet another avenue to work their will on the public; (2) generally speaking, laws should be laws, not constitutional amendments or initiative statutes, where they're essentially etched in stone forever; and (3) ballot box budgeting is a curse. So keep my biases in mind as you read this.

It's worth noting that my dislike of initiatives softens a bit when there's no choice in the matter. We Californians have passed a ton of initiatives in the past, and since that etches them in stone (see No. 2, supra) it means that the only way to change them is via another initiative. I don't like it, but that's life. I'm mentioning this because several of this year's initiatives fall into this category, and they account for several of my Yes recommendations.

$9 billion school bond. YES. This is pretty routine stuff—though a little less routine than usual due to school funding fights between the Legislature and the governor. Still, unless you have a serious problem with the fact that $500 million of this money would go to charter schools, there's no big reason to oppose it.

Except for one: California doesn't really need more debt, and I continue to be unsure why stuff like this can't be funded out of general revenues instead of  bonds. That's an argument for another day, but for some people it might be reason enough to oppose Prop 51.

Hospital fees. NO. A few years ago, California created a new hospital fee that raised $4.6 billion per year. Of this, $900 million went to the general fund and $3.7 billion went to our Medicaid program. Prop 52 would make it much harder to divert any of the money from this fee to the general fund. I'm in favor of generously funding Medicaid, but I'm very much opposed to ballot-box budgeting. The Legislature's job is to decide how money is spent, and they should be left free to do so. If you don't like it, vote them out of office.

Voter approval for revenue bonds over $2 billion. NO. I'm generally opposed to the whole initiative process in the first place, so why would I want to extend it further?

Three-day wait before voting on bills. YES. This initiative mandates that (a) bills be published 72 hours before they're voted on, (b) all open legislative proceedings be recorded and put online within 24 hours, and (c) anyone can record open legislative proceedings for themselves. Opponents say this would mostly benefit special interests, who would have more time to gin up opposition to bills before they're passed at the last minute. That may be. It's also true that this initiative is the pet project of a local zillionaire. And yet, this stuff all seems like a fairly modest stab at transparency in legislating—and it's certainly nothing that the Democrats in charge of things will ever pass on their own. In the end, it's hard to think of any persuasive, nonpartisan reason to object to it.

Extension of income tax increase. NO. In 2012, California passed an initiative that temporarily raised a variety of taxes on the wealthy in order to increase funding to schools. Prop 55 would extend this tax through 2030, essentially making it permanent.

This smells too much like a bait-and-switch for my taste. The state budget was in a mess four years ago, and this tax was arguably necessary. That's not true today, and permanently relying on taxes from the very rich makes state revenue extremely volatile. We need a better, more stable tax structure, and that might include higher taxes on the rich. But a patch like this, which was meant to be temporary, deserves to be allowed to die.

$2 cigarette tax. NO. California's cigarette tax is quite low, and a higher tax would certainly help to reduce cigarette use and improve public health. I'd vote yes on this in a heartbeat except for one thing: Virtually all the revenue is allocated to a miscellaneous set of very specific programs. I've had enough of this. Just put the damn revenue into the general fund. The curse of ballot-box budgeting needs to end.

Early parole for nonviolent offenders. YES. California is under a federal order to reduce its prison population. This initiative would modestly help us reach that goal by providing incentives for nonviolent inmates to qualify for early parole.

Repeal of Prop 227. YES. In 1998, California passed an initiative that eliminated bilingual education and mandated that all children be taught in English-only classes. This was a perfect example of a stupid initiative. Even if it's good policy, it's a terrible thing to carve into stone as part of the constitution. Repeal it and let the Legislature and local school districts deal with this.

""Advisory question"" to overturn Citizens United. NO. The initiative process is not designed for you to send feel-good messages out to the universe. This ""advisory question"" is a waste of everyone's time, and the last thing we should do is encourage others to fill up the ballot with junk like this. If you want to overturn Citizens United, vote for a president who will nominate Supreme Court justices likely to do so.

Condoms in porn films. NO. This is probably a bad measure on the merits, but that hardly matters. It's something for the Legislature to deal with. In no way does it rise to the level of something that should be decided by initiative.

Prescription drug price regulation. NO. Prop 61 mandates that the state of California cannot buy prescription drugs at a price higher than that paid by the Department of Veterans Affairs, which is widely believed to get the best price around. The opposition claims this would cause drug companies to charge the VA more, thus hurting vets. This is a stretch, and I wouldn't pay too much attention to it.

Unfortunately, the arguments in favor of Prop 61 are tenuous. Although the VA publishes the price it pays for most drugs, the real prices it pays are often lower, thanks to special discounts. This makes it unclear how Prop 61 would be enforced. It's also unclear if it would even save any money. As the legislative analyst points out, giving California Medicaid a lower price would, by federal law, entitle all state Medicaid programs to the same price. One way or another, drug companies would do something to maintain their current pricing and profitability—and there's no telling who would pay the price for this.

This initiative is my toughest call. I like the idea of reducing drug prices. But doing it on a piecemeal basis like this runs real risks of unintended consequences—all while also running a risk of not even accomplishing its goal. In this case, my bias against initiatives has the final say: Prop 61 is too ambiguous to be written into stone. It might be a good legislative action, but either way, the Legislature is where it belongs.

Repeal the death penalty. YES. This is exactly what it sounds like, and you hardly need my advice on what to do. I'm not personally opposed to the death penalty on moral grounds, but I've long been convinced that in practice it simply can't be applied fairly. And it doesn't really do any good, anyway. I'm happy to get rid of it.

Background checks for ammunition purchasers. NO. For a long time there's been a competition of sorts between Lt. Governor Gavin Newsom and Senate leader Kevin de León over who can be the king of gun control. This summer, de León passed several gun control bills, including ones that (a) ban possession of large-capacity magazines and (b) require sellers of ammunition to make sure that buyers are not prohibited persons. Newsom's Prop 63 was already on the ballot when the legislation passed, and it largely duplicates it with only a modest bit of tightening. Since I always prefer a legislative solution to an initiative, if possible, I think it's best to let the new laws do their job. Prop 63 just doesn't do enough to be worth an initiative at this point.

Marijuana legalization. YES. This initiative is pretty straightforward, legalizing the cultivation and sale of marijuana. I'd rather have the Legislature do this, but there are just too many incentives working against them to ever get this done. I'd also prefer the revenue from Prop 64's taxes to be allocated to the general fund, but I guess we can't have everything.

Plastic bag revenue. NO. In a typical California clusterfuck, this initiative is designed to change the ballot-box budgeting in Prop 67 to a different kind of ballot-box budgeting. This is ridiculous. Just vote no.

Death penalty procedures. NO. This would supersede Prop 62, which repeals the death penalty.

Plastic bag ban. YES. This is a referendum on a legislative measure that bans single-use plastic bags. To be honest, I don't care very much about plastic bags, but lots of cities and counties have already banned them, and it's probably a good idea to have a single statewide policy. And since it's an ordinary legislative measure, it can be changed later if it needs to be."
100709,1006,"Poll: 19% of Republicans believe sexual assault allegations against Trump, if true, should disqualify him",http://hotair.com/archives/2016/10/18/poll-19-republicans-believe-sexual-assault-allegations-trump-disqualify-even-theyre-true/,26,"Not great, GOP. As the man himself might say, really not terrific!

To be clear, though, I think this is less of a “look what Republicans have come to” result than a “look what partisanship has come to” thing. The right isn’t about to be reproached for its callousness towards victims of sexual assault by a party that made Ted “Waitress Sandwich” Kennedy a secular saint and continues to treat Juanita Broaddrick as though she’s some sort of kook. Both parties, alas, stand by their man in these situations. Note that the question asks specifically if the charges would be disqualifying if they’re true, i.e. if they could be proved. Proof of multiple sex offenses wouldn’t be disqualifying in a U.S. president? W-w-wut?

You can spin that two ways if you doubt the result. One is that there’s precedent here. If rape didn’t disqualify Bill Clinton, why should an assault or two disqualify a Republican nominee? That logic would represent a pitiful lowering of its own moral standards by the right, but then that’s the story of the past 16 months. The other spin is that, although the question assumes that the assaults really did happen, maybe the people being polled didn’t pay much attention to that caveat in responding. Maybe they thought they were being asked, simply, “Do you think the mere fact that Trump was accused of these things is disqualifying?” Just 12 percent(!) of Republicans said they found the charges credible, so go figure that when they were asked if the charges are disqualifying, most would also instinctively say no. The problem with that spin, though, is that there’s no reason to think they didn’t understand the question exactly as it was asked. Pretending that they didn’t is just that — pretending.

So yeah, there’s partisanship at work here. Even among independents, in fact. As HuffPo notes, indies who lean Democratic are 78 points more likely to consider the charges against Trump credible than indies who lean Republican are. On the other hand, WaPo published an interesting study yesterday showing that self-identified Republicans might be more skeptical of sexual assault claims as a general rule than Democrats are. If the partisan shoe were on the other foot, you might well see more than 19 percent of Democrats say that the accusations, if true, are disqualifying. Although, given the Kennedy/Clinton precedents, maybe not much more.

One other note from the poll: 53 percent of the public, including majorities of both men (54) and women (52), rejected the idea that Trump’s “Access Hollywood” tape was normal “locker room talk” by men. Among the majority on that is, er, Howard Stern: Here’s Trump sidekick Chris Christie being asked if he’s “proud” of the campaign. In lieu of an exit question, read People magazine’s new story today citing six different witnesses who claim that writer Natasha Stoynoff told them long ago about Trump’s alleged assault on her at Mar-a-Lago in 2005. One colleague claims Stoynoff told him about it the night that it happened. Another claims Stoynoff told her the following day. Why People decided to go ahead and run Stoynoff’s puff piece on Trump anyway is a mystery, if you count “not wanting to upset a celebrity whom the magazine covers” as a mystery. "
100710,1006,"Project Veritas, part two: Dem activists discuss best practices in committing voter fraud without getting caught",http://hotair.com/archives/2016/10/18/project-veritas-part-two-dem-activists-discuss-best-practices-committing-voter-fraud-without-getting-caught/,26,"If you watched yesterday’s video, you already know who Scott Foval is. And if you read the news online last night, you already know he’s been fired after PV revealed his schemes to use mentally ill homeless people, among others, to inspire “anarchy” at Republican events. Whether Foval has really been “fired” or merely lateral-ed over to some other dark-arts Democratic operation, of which there seems to be an infinite amount, time will tell. It’d be mighty weird for Dems to suddenly grow a conscience about this stuff after employing him, seemingly to successful ends, for years.

The new video out this afternoon resumes with Foval but the topic this time is more immediately germane to the election: How much voter fraud is going on out there? As usual, he’s brimming with ideas, starting with using rental cars instead of buses to bring people in from out of state to vote so that prosecutors would have a harder time proving a conspiracy to commit fraud. There’s nothing concrete here about trying to stuff the ballot box next month — the DREAMer activist near the end mentions 2018 as a possibility for a scheme involving buses — but there’s also nothing suggesting any ethical qualms about these sorts of tactics, even when they’re being raised by PV’s undercover agents. The closest we get to a hard “no” is when Bob Creamer of Democracy Partners resists one voter-fraud proposal offered by PV, only to have Foval assure the investigator afterward (at 13:00) that he and Creamer discussed it and that it’s more a matter of Creamer keeping his fingerprints off of the diciest schemes. “Other people can make things happen that you don’t need to know about,” Foval claims he told Creamer. At another point, Foval describes himself as the “dark hat” to Creamer’s “white hat.” Like I say, there’s no way this guy doesn’t reemerge at some other left-wing dirty-tricks shop once the heat from these videos dies down.

Congressional Republicans will, I assume, hold hearings about all of this next year — unless they lose both majorities, in which case not a word will be breathed of them again on the Hill.

Update: Well, well. Looks like the heat just got too hot for Creamer too."
100711,1006,Media bias: It’s real and goes beyond the contributions,http://hotair.com/archives/2016/10/18/media-bias-real-goes-beyond-contributions/,26,"When an industry’s employees push 96% of its reportable campaign contributions to one candidate, it’s fair to say it has a bias in a particular direction. When that industry is the national media, much of which purports to deliver objective reporting and analysis of said campaign, it’s more than fair to assume that the bias enters into their product. Washington Post analyst Callum Borchers tries to argue today that not all media figures are equal, and that political contributions do not measure media bias:

The donation discrepancy certainly won’t boost confidence in the neutrality of news reports, but numbers don’t tell the whole story. There are no campaign trail reporters on the list of Clinton contributors named in the Center for Public Integrity’s report; the only name that could be classified as covering the presidential politics beat in any way this year would be RT host Larry King, whose celebrity-oriented show features occasional political interviews …

The Center for Public Integrity’s findings would be far more concerning if they included the journalists who shape coverage of the race for the White House.

One could argue that people who work in the media — in any capacity — should refrain from making political donations. But because not everyone subscribes to that philosophy, let’s be clear about who the donors are: They are TV and food critics, sports and fashion editors, and local news reporters.
Borchers is correct that donations do not measure bias in reporting, although they can certainly indicate some bias in the reporters themselves. Fortunately, we don’t need to look far to corroborate what the CPI research suggests. The Shorenstein Center has conducted two surveys of media coverage in this cycle, the latter of which focused on media coverage of the four-week period in which the two major-party conventions took place. In my column for The Week, I contrast the coverage given to Donald Trump and Hillary Clinton, and the disparity becomes pretty obvious — and spectacular:

A study from Harvard’s Shorenstein Center of the four weeks encompassing and surrounding the two major-party political conventions makes this obvious. Trump’s news coverage during this period was 75 percent negative; the friendliest week Trump got from the media was the week of the convention itself — when it was “only” 55 percent negative.

Contrast that with the treatment Hillary Clinton received in the same period, which overall was 44 percent positive. Where no news outlet in the Shorenstein study managed to get to 40 percent positive coverage of Trump, all but one (Washington Times) had 40 percent or more positive coverage of Clinton. Four of the 11 media outlets offered better than 50 percent positive coverage to Clinton. While coverage of Trump’s qualifications only generated 22 percent positive coverage, 69 percent of the coverage of Clinton’s leadership qualities was positive.
Unlike Borchers’ argument, this relates directly to news coverage, not talking-head punditry or food reviews. Recall too that both conventions had divisive atmospheres, so there’s not much of an excuse for disparity of treatment. The first day of the Democratic convention was dominated by booing and protests from Bernie Sanders’ delegates, and at one point they “occupied” the media tent to get more attention from the press.

This cuts both ways, though, as the first Shorenstein study proved in July. Trump benefited from a bias in both scope and tone of coverage from the national media, with a 2:1 positive ratio on the latter throughout 2015. Thomas Patterson, the author of both studies, noted the dramatic change in coverage in his second analysis. “From the time he announced his candidacy until the start of the conventions,” he points out, “Trump had not experienced anywhere near the press criticism directed at him during the final two weeks of the convention period.”

Until then, Trump and his backers assumed that he had a winning formula of manipulating the media, but that turned out to be an illusion:

Republicans have long contended with media bias. That was one of Trump’s supposed selling points — that his celebrity would outmatch any bias in the media, and that his own media savvy would make him unbeatable. Republicans who prized victory over policy or character backed Trump because he would hold nothing back, taking the fight to the Clintons and using his mastery of media manipulation to benefit the GOP. Skeptics pointed out that Trump’s long and controversial history in business and the media made him particularly vulnerable to late-season attacks based on opposition research — and that primary media coverage patterns would not hold up in the general-election season.

Clearly, the skeptics got it right.
In a way, everyone’s right. Trump is correct that the media is trying to “rig” the election through its coverage and influence with voters. However, Trump might not be here at all had it not been for media manipulation in the primary, either through his own power or as a longer-term strategy from the media itself. It’s also a lesson that running an unvetted and inexperienced candidate in a general election will usually backfire, especially for Republicans facing a hostile media environment. But there is absolutely no doubt that this media bias exists."
100712,1008,America’s Most Honorable Men Stand with Trump,http://www.americanthinker.com/articles/2016/10/americas_most_honorable_men_stand_with_trump.html,26,"When Hillary Clinton’s media tried to make Trump’s crude sexual banter the centerpiece of the last debate, Trump pivoted to national security and once again said how proud he is to be backed by 200 generals and admirals.   

These are among America’s finest, bravest, most admirable men.   Seventeen medal of honor winners endorsed Trump.  So did fifteen brigadier generals, thirty-four major generals, eighteen lieutenant generals, forty-one rear admirals, six vice-admirals, and three 4 star generals and admirals.

Such men do not put their names down for a candidate and a cause without serious thought.

This is what they signed their names to on the choice between Hillary and Trump:

The 2016 election affords the American people an urgently needed opportunity to make a long-overdue course correction in our national security posture and policy.  As retired senior leaders of America’s military, we believe that such a change can only be made by someone who has not been deeply involved with, and substantially responsible for, the hollowing out of our military and the burgeoning threats facing our country around the world. 

For this reason, we support Donald Trump’s candidacy to be our next Commander-in-Chief. 

 For the past eight years, America’s armed forces have been subjected to a series of ill-considered and debilitating budget cuts, policy choices and combat operations that have left the superb men and women in uniform less capable of performing their vital missions in the future than we require them to be.   

 Simultaneously, enemies of this country have been emboldened, sensing weakness and irresolution in Washington and opportunities for aggression at our expense and that of other freedom-loving nations.   

In our professional judgment, the combined effect is potentially extremely perilous.  That is especially the case if our government persists in the practices that have brought us to this present pass.   

For this reason, we support Donald Trump and his commitment to rebuild our military, to secure our borders, to defeat our Islamic supremacist adversaries and restore law and order domestically.  We urge our fellow Americans to do the same.

This letter from our military leaders to the voting public was organized by Major General Shachnow.



Major General Shachnow has an amazing life story told in his memoir, Hope and Honor.  His life experience help explains his leadership in opposing Hillary Clinton and supporting Donald Trump.   Shachnow is the only Holocaust survivor to become a U.S. General and was a legend in the Green Berets, with whom he served for forty years.

Like the perfidious Hillary supporter, the Nazi collaborator George Soros, Major General Sid Shachnow was a child in Nazi-era Europe.  Shachnow took the opposite path from Soros.

Shachnow was seven years old when the Nazis invaded his town, burned alive doctors and patients in the hospital, gunned down the elderly and orphans, and rounded up the Jews in a “grand action,” sending ten thousand directly to their deaths. Shachnow and his parents were sent to the nightmare Kovno concentration camp, where he survived for three years before his resourceful family escaped once again, only days before the children’s death march to Auschwitz.  There followed months of surviving in the forests, before the Shachnows joined up with Zionist partisans and stealthily crossed 2000 miles of Soviet-occupied Europe to reach freedom in the American zone in Germany. Eventually Shachnow’s family immigrated to America.  He joined the U.S. Army before graduating from high school and, for obvious reasons, volunteered for the Green Berets.  He eventually rose to command the Green Berets, and helped develop America’s modern Special Forces.

In his memoir, Gen. Shachnow wrote: “I remembered how the American GIs had inspired me as a young immigrant and ignited in me dreams for freedom and a better life…Freedom is a reality that everyone deserves.”

Maj. Gen Shachnow was awarded many medals and honors including, the Silver Star with Oak Leaf Clusters, the Bronze Star with Oak Leaf Clusters and ""V"" device, the Purple Heart with Oak Leaf Cluster.

Major General Shachnow teamed with Rear Admiral Charles Williams to quickly gather other retired military flag officers to support a Trump victory.  Rear Admiral Williams’s personal awards include the Legion of Merit, Defense Meritorious Service Medal, two Navy Meritorious Service Medals and two Navy Commendation Medals.  He served onboard submarines, aircraft, surface ships, and with Seabee and SEAL team units, including the successful evacuation of Americans out of war-torn Lebanon following the attack on our U.S. Embassy. Rear Admiral Williams’ last service was running the Naval Inventory Control Point responsible for aviation, ship, and submarine repair.  He understands our woeful loss of readiness under the current administration. 

Google these admirals and generals and medal of honor recipients and you will know Trump is utterly sincere when he states he is humbled and honored by their support.

Admiral Jerome (Jerry)Johnson was a four-star Admiral who served on active duty for almost 38 years; his final assignment was the Vice Chief of Naval Operations. At sea he commanded Attack Squadron Twenty-seven (VA-27), the combat stores ship USS San Jose, the aircraft carrier USS Coral Sea, the Carrier Group Four, the US Second Fleet and NATO’s Striking Fleet Atlantic.

Gen. Alfred Hansen is a retired four star US Air Force general who served as Commander, Air Force Logistics command. In Vietnam, he flew 113 combat missions. In 1985 he became director for logistics for the Joint chiefs of Staff. In this position, he was responsible for worldwide logistics in support of theater commander’s war plans and was a member of the Senior NATO Logistics Forum.

Lt. General Marvin Covault, US Army (ret) was former chief of staff for NATO forces in Southern Europe. He had 32 years of military experience.

Lt. General Timothy Kinnan, US Air Force, served as Vice Director for Strategic Plans and Policy with the Joint Chiefs of Staff  developing military strategy and policy. His final active duty assignment was as US Military Representative to NATO Military Committee in Belgium, NATO’s highest military authority.

Hershel Woodrow ""Woody"" Williams (born October 2, 1923) is a retired United States Marine who received the Medal of Honor for his actions in the Battle of Iwo Jima during World War II. He is the last surviving recipient of the Medal of Honor from that battle. 

Landing on February 21, 1945, Williams, by then a corporal, distinguished himself two days later when American tanks, trying to open a lane for infantry, encountered a network of reinforced concrete pillboxes. Williams went forward alone with his 70-pound (32 kg) flamethrower to attempt the reduction of devastating machine gun fire from the unyielding positions.



Harry Truman congratulates Hershel Williams on being awarded the Medal of Honor, 5 October 1945

Covered by only four riflemen, he fought for four hours under terrific enemy small-arms fire and repeatedly returned to his own lines to prepare demolition charges and obtain serviced flame throwers. He returned to the front, frequently to the rear of hostile emplacements, to wipe out one position after another. At one point, a wisp of smoke alerted him to the air vent of a Japanese bunker, and he approached close enough to put the nozzle of his flamethrower through the hole, killing the occupants. On another occasion, he was charged by enemy riflemen who attempted to stop him with bayonets and he killed them with a burst of flame from his weapon.

These actions occurred on the same day as the raising of the U.S. flag commemorated in the famous photo and later statute for the Marine Corps War Memorial.


These are the men who stand with Trump and want him as our Commander in Chief.

100713,1008,Trump’s Invisible Shield,http://www.americanthinker.com/articles/2016/10/trumps_invisible_shield.html,26,"It already seems like a lifetime ago that MachadoGate and Lewd-Comments-on-the-Bus-Gate appeared on the political scene and, according to all news sources, derailed the Trump candidacy.  Little did we know that a few days later, the Trump campaign would be dealt yet another setback -- only this time by a cadre of women parading around the alphabet stations with sudden flashbacks of memory that conveniently materialized just a few weeks before the election.  According to the punditry and press, the Trump campaign has received a death blow from which it cannot recover.  Clinton is president!

For anyone paying attention to presidential campaigns, this could hardly be a surprise -- after all, it is October and our opponent is the party of “win at all costs.”  While imbecilic Republicans bicker and snicker about Trump, Democrats will, once again, coalesce around Hillary despite their competing coalitions.  Republicans are stuck in the quagmire of who killed the GOP and who is a more principled conservative, while the Democrats work with their media comrades and perfect their ground game.  How do they do it?  By dangling distractions with the one hand that Republicans fall for every time, while working their election magic with the other hand.

Prior to this succession of October surprises, right-wing Trump-haters had somewhat backed off, but now have re-emerged more emboldened and feeling completely vindicated.  The end of Trump is nigh, they gleefully clamor.  It’s time for him to resign.  Congressmen are jumping ship.  Others are planning to mutiny.

Trump may very well lose the election.  I’m not in the habit of prognosticating either way. But personally, I think it is just as likely he pulls this off as he is annihilated.

I’m not advocating for Trump in as much as for the people who support him.  And that is the piece to this conundrum that has been missing all along: the People -- not a bunch of deplorables and irredeemables, hunkering down in their basket of -isms.  But marginalized average Americans hurt by Democrat policies and used by Republican politicians.  These are the “everyday Americans” that a flawed and filthy rich Hillary loathes.  These are the “everyday Americans” that a flawed and filthy rich Trump embraces.

While this isn’t news, I still don’t think anyone has really grasped the Trump phenomenon and what really feeds it.

Let me first tell you what this election is not.  It is not about a cult of personality centered around the Donald, as some claim. It is not about his debonnaire je ne c’est quois.  It isn’t about his political acumen or his finesse on the debate stage.  It isn’t about his ability to pivot and re-direct answers to questions. It isn’t about knowing the minutiae of information required to pass a State Department exam.  It really isn’t even about his business prowess or successful deal making.

Support for Trump is more of a jury nullification -- a complete rejection of all of the evidence. Not the evidence of how bad things are -- we all know our economic, cultural, and national security health is hanging by a thread.  It is the wholesale renunciation of all that political gamesmanship has wrought.  Things may be grim, but if we don’t address the underlying cause of “WHY” our outlook is bleak and it doesn’t matter who is elected.  The cycle of misery will just continue.  Too few who earn their living inside the Beltway seem to get this; and the few who do, rarely have national exposure.

It is also too simplistic to cast the Trump phenomenon as the natural outgrowth of the fading glory of the angry and frustrated white man juxtaposed against the ascendant power of minorities -- the throwaway line that permeates political commentary.  It is far more nuanced than that.

The Trump phenomenon is better understood as a colossal F U to all of the lies and broken promises politicians have hoisted upon the masses over the years.  It is the savage blowback to the money-sucking rules and regulations and taxes that heavily burden a broad range of the middle and upper middle classes. It is a YUGE “suck it” to the self-aggrandizement and pocket lining that goes on within the Beltway.  It is a swift backlash against the swarm of Beltway wannabees who want in on DC action in order to enrich themselves on the backs of the people, to the detriment of the country.

It is the sweeping repudiation of the Democrat-Media Complex with its corruption, collusion, and revolving door between Democrat candidates like Hillary, the White House, the DOJ, the IRS, the press, the academy, the 1%, the think tanks, Wall Street, the Occupy and Black Lives Movements, the unions, the community organizers, and the entire Democrat Party apparatus.

It is a gigantic body slam against the brutal tactics the left employs every election -- regardless of who the candidate is and what his/her credentials may be -- tactics deployed to seek and destroy the opponent at all costs using falsehoods that are shamelessly disseminated because the ends justifies the means.

This election is a referendum against the very kind of unbalanced treatment of the candidates we see unfolding right now, where the only news featured is Trump’s sexual misconduct.  Anyone with a passing interest in the election tuning into the MSM for an update has no idea about Hillary’s history, her transgressions, or her incompetence.  They will not know about her intentional destruction of emails that belong to the People, her illegal server, her lies to the FBI, her negligence in Benghazi, or how she destroyed the women who, in her own words, deserve to be heard, how she mocked stay-at-home moms who like to bake cookies, let alone how she portrayed a little girl who was raped as the predator, then laughed about it.  Some champion of women and children.

This is a referendum against the press looking the other way as far as Hillary Clinton goes, while perseverating on the foibles of Trump; against the kind of mean-spirited, scorched earth tactics employed by the left that always emerge in the final weeks before the election.  It doesn’t matter if the lies are about tax returns, salacious affairs, Air National Guard, DUIs, women in binders, dogs on roofs, or illegally obtained tape recordings from private events.  This is how it always goes.   

And the little guys have had enough -- and they aren’t just men, they aren’t just white, and they aren’t just the working class whose jobs have been displaced.  They are legion and span the demographic spectrum.  The Democrats aren’t worried about winning.  They’re worried about the backlash and they should be.

The attitude of the average Trump supporter is that no matter how much of a buffoon he might be, he isn’t as bad as all of the other career pols out there who misstate, misspeak, and misremember but always get away with it because they claim to be above the fray, of impeccable character, or to soar high when others stoop low.  Whether hard-core from the get-go or johnny-come-latelies, Trump supporters have such little regard for political elites, that they’ll support anyone who isn’t making his or her money off of their votes.

The more the media focus on Trump’s indiscretions while blatantly ignoring the mounting evidence of the Clinton Machine’s abuse of power and complicity in criminal, treasonous activities that put the homeland at risk, the more people dig in their heels for Trump.

This might not be enough for Trump to win, but that’s ok.  Trump is the second phase of a freedom-based-on-constitutional-governance-movement whose genesis started with the Tea Party.  Even though Trump is not a Tea Party candidate and Tea Partiers generally did not support him in the primaries, they want many of the same things -- restoring liberty, law and order; returning to constitutional governance and limited government; and unleashing the power of free markets.

Do not mistake Donald Trump for the movement or even its leader.  He is merely a conduit for that movement to act and organize; the first national voice of what is still a grassroots movement.

The Tea Party had a tough time getting press attention; Donald does not.  He might stink as a candidate.  His character might be less than worthy.  But he is and was the only guy on the debate stage willing to say what needs to be said, offering to do what needs to be done, speaking on behalf of those who have been silenced by the left’s own version of intolerance, bullying, and political correctness.  He’s got our six and he’s unafraid.

This is why evangelicals can vote for a guy whose views on life, gay marriage and religion are debatable; why they can turn the other cheek when he uses crude language.  This is why accomplished professional women who have broken the glass ceiling working in a man’s world, like Ann Coulter (or me) can put up with his remarks about women and still vote for him.  This is why devoted and hardened conservatives like Bill Bennett or Victor Davis Hanson, who take their conservatism seriously, can vote for Trump. This is why Tea party conservatives who supported Anyone But Trump in the primaries, can support Anyone But Clinton in the general election.

The People understand what this election is about.  Why can’t the rest of the conservative universe?  While pundits like Jonah Goldberg and George Will have turned this into a urinating contest of who is the more conservative conservative and who is doing more to destroy the GOP and conservatism, the People are waging a completely different war, using bunker-busting bombs to destroy the mess at its core.

The two-party system has already been irretrievably corrupted with bugs and malware.  No matter what we say, no matter what buttons we push, nothing will change.  The only fix is a virus and it just so happens, Trump is the virus.  But it could have been anyone -- as long as he or she would call out the double standards and refuse to cower or capitulate when attacked by self-righteous pundits, haranguing journalists, rabid Democrats, or scaredy-cat Republicans.

Have no doubt.  This is every bit a renunciation of Obama’s eight years, failed Democrat policies, and Hillary Clinton’s failures in office, as it is of the Washington leviathan, including our own defectors on the right.  Everyday Americans are looking for an advocate, a champion, a voice, and a backbone, not a spineless sycophant who apologizes and backtracks when the going gets tough.

Millions of everyday Americans have flipped the proverbial bird to overweening government bureaucracy, the political process, political elites, and the entire political machine.  They know they are ignored.  But Trump can be heard above the din of even the most biased in the media.

And Trump is the collective voice of more than 50 million F U’s.

100714,1008,Why Hillary and Her Wall Street Donors Don’t Want Trump’s Wall,http://www.americanthinker.com/articles/2016/10/why_hillary_and_her_wall_street_donors_dont_want_trumps_wall.html,26,"When GOP presidential candidate Donald Trump first talked about building a “big, beautiful wall” at the southern border of the U.S. he was met with fierce resistance. Given the facts that the southern border is the main route used by drug smugglers and criminal illegal immigrants (all persons who cross the border illegal commit a Federal misdemeanor the first time, a felony the second time) there would not seem to be a good reason to resist lawful regulation of border entry. As usual, the answer may be in who gains from the absence of a Wall, and what they gain. The best way to get the answer is to follow the money.

Right now the transfer of money from persons working in the U.S. to Mexico, called “personal remittances” are a major source of Mexican revenue. The growth of remittance revenue is a recent development. Mexico seized the assets of nearly all foreign oil companies operating in Mexico in 1938. But as American sanctuary cities flouted Federal law and encouraged illegal immigration after 1980, those working in the U.S. started to wire transfer money back to their families in amounts that became so large that by the late 1990s remittances to Mexico were the second largest source of foreign revenues, second only to oil revenues.

According to the World Bank, in 2015 the world’s top remittance corridor was from the United States to Mexico. As much as $25.2 billion dollars was sent back to Mexico from people working in the U.S. Remittances are a great source of revenue for Mexico and are more stable than all other flows such as oil.

In 1979 the Police Chief of Los Angeles publicly stated that he would not enforce immigration law. Following this announcement, which was the effective beginning of Los Angeles as a sanctuary city, remittances to Mexico from the U.S. grew very rapidly from only $177 million in 1979 to $26.9 billion in 2007, following the growth of those sectors of the economy such as construction where illegal immigrants worked. After the 2007 economic peak there was a drop in 2009 to $22 billion. But in 2015 the amount of remittances climbed back to $26.2 billion, according to the World Bank. Ninety-eight percent of all remittances sent to Mexico come from the U.S.

It is no coincidence that the most rapid growth occurred from 2000 to 2008 when Vincente Fox was the president of Mexico. This is why the most emotional and energetic resistance to the Wall came from Vincente Fox, who used abusive language toward Trump. His statement were cloaked in emotion and anger, a skillfully crafted disguise for the real reason for his concern: money.

One in every eleven persons born in Mexico has gone to the U.S. The National Review reported that in 2014 $1.87 billion was spent on incarcerating illegal immigrant criminals.

Since the political economy of Los Angeles depends so heavily on the Federal and state program money that supports illegal immigration, the Los Angeles Times still defends Special Order 40 as essential to, paradoxically, law and order. It’s also essential to the economy of Los Angeles but somehow the Times doesn’t mention that fact.

One may ask why the Federal government chooses to spend so much money on the incarceration of criminal aliens by defying the Federal 1996 Immigration Act. But it’s important to keep in mind the benefits the Federal government, particularly the Democrat Party, the party of government sector teacher unions, obtains from illegal immigration. After all, their four biggest campaign contributors, the Service Employees International Union, the National Education Association, American Federation of State, County and Municipal Employees and American Federation of Teachers are four of the top six contributors from 1989 to present. And they give over 99% of their contributors to Democrats. Today sixty five percent of public school students in Los Angeles County are Hispanic. In Chicago 46% are Hispanic.

Democrats, who have dominated almost all large metropolitan areas since FDR, are heavily dependent on illegal immigrants and their children. Should Trump build an effective wall, he would disrupt the flow of illegal immigrants, public school students, teacher union donations and block grant money to all their most important bases of electoral and demographic support. Trump’s wall is the major threat to what they see as their party’s long term goal of maintaining control of state governments as well as the national government.

Multimillionaire Jorge Ramos of Univision has criticized Trump aggressively. While Univision may have no obvious direct financial interest in remittances, their TV network certainly stands to profit from increases in Hispanic viewership, increases that are totally dependent on the growth of the Hispanic populations in cities they serve.

In short, everything that matters to Hillary and her Democrat Party is existentially threatened by Trump’s wall. And as a personal matter, Hillary’s multi-million dollar speech income from Wall Street contributors is also threatened: the banks make money from the wire transfers. Every time someone in the U.S. wires money to Mexico, the banks, currency exchanges, and other providers of wire transfer services make easy money. And the loss of low paying jobs to teenagers and seniors to illegal immigrants also contributes to the recession. Hillary and her party supporters desperately need illegal immigrants: Hillary is bought and paid for.

We now know that the big Wall Street banks bought her and you are paying for it in many ways. Hillary will not reveal what she has said to big bank contributors, but it is not unlikely that she reassured them that she will allow an open border to exist on the Southern part of the U.S. Recent email leaks have confirmed that she believes in open borders.

And then there’s the humanitarian issue. After all, the rationalization for allowing illegal immigration is that we need people to do “low paid jobs no one else will do.” This is a racist, humiliating characterization of Hispanics from Mexico and other Central American countries. America’s most shameful chapter in its history was its promotion of the institution of slavery, the importation of blacks from Africa to do “low paid jobs no one else will do.” It is hard to understand how anyone with sensitivity toward racial minorities can now bring up another generation of low paid workers. Vincente Fox never discusses this abuse, or the rape trees human smugglers construct as monuments to their criminal rape of young Hispanic women illegally crossing the border from the South.

Those following the money trail would say this follows the pattern perfectly: that Hillary allows illegal immigrants to be exploited by cartels and rapists in order for the banks she protects to collect their remittance transfer money. Somehow these humanitarian topics are avoided. We know that Wall Street investment banks gave tens of millions to support Barack Obama and Hillary Clinton. These same banks make easy profits from of illegal immigrant bank transfer fees as well as high interest rate home loans and car loans targeted to Hispanics.

Hillary’s lack of humanitarian concern is accompanied by a silence toward the issue of money.

100715,1009,THE TRUMP-RYAN FIGHT IS A GOOD THING,http://www.powerlineblog.com/archives/2016/10/the-trump-ryan-fight-is-a-good-thing.php,26,"Ever since Speaker Ryan declined to appear with Donald Trump after the Billy Bush tape became public, Trump has been attacking Ryan. His latest claim is that Ryan has backed away from Trump in order to facilitate a 2020 presidential bid.

The claim is absurd. Ryan backed Trump for months when it looked like Trump might win. Now that it’s almost certain Trump won’t win, Ryan doesn’t improve his presidential prospects by backing away from the Republican nominee. Trump supporters will hold this against Ryan; hard-core NeverTrumpers will remain angry at Ryan for his initial support of the tycoon.

It’s unseemly for the Republican presidential nominee and the Republican Speaker of the House to be feuding just weeks before the election. But I’m glad they are.

Here’s why.

If Trump loses but the GOP maintains control of the House — a highly likely scenario — Speaker Ryan will be in a position to make deals with President Hillary Clinton. History suggests that he will want to make them.

Recall the budget deal he struck with Patty Murray in 2013. Recall that Ryan has reached out to Democrats for “infrastructure” talks. Recall that Ryan favors amnesty-style immigration reform. Recall that he favors more lenient federal sentencing for felons. Recall his chumminess with left-wing Rep. Luis Gutierrez.

Ryan wants to get things done. He wants to shed his Party’s reputation as obstructionist.

He either doesn’t understand or doesn’t care that “obstructionism” is what’s preventing, or at least slowing, the left’s takeover of America. He either doesn’t understand or doesn’t care that nothing can get done with Democrats that doesn’t include some of their core left-wing agenda items.

Donald Trump’s denunciation of Ryan won’t alter the Speaker’s ambitions. But if he works with Clinton in meaningful ways, he will reinforce Trump’s critique of him and alienate not just the hard-core Trumpers but also hard-core conservatives. If the 2016 GOP primaries are indicative, that’s most of the Republican Party.

And speaking of the 2016 primaries, perhaps Ryan will put two and two together and realize that it was the eagerness of Republicans like him to work with Democrats on amnesty-style immigration reform that fueled the rise of Trump.

In sum, Ryan’s feud with Trump leaves the Speaker with a choice. He can wear the goat horns Trump is trying to place on his head or he can resist his desire to work with Clinton and, with Trump on the sidelines doing whatever, establish himself as the leader of the fight to block Clinton’s leftist agenda.

If Ryan chooses to wear the horns, he won’t be the Republican nominee for president and he may find his position as Speaker in jeopardy."
100716,1009,TRUMP IS RIGHT ABOUT PRESS RIGGING ELECTION. BUT…,http://www.powerlineblog.com/archives/2016/10/trump-is-right-about-press-rigging-election-but.php,26,"Over the last several days, headlines have blared Donald Trump’s claim that the presidential election is “rigged.” When he initially said this, it was clear that he meant it was being rigged by the media, through biased news coverage, as in this tweet: Since then he has appropriately expanded the theme to include voter fraud, but I want to stay with the original media version. Trump is absolutely correct that the liberal press has thrown its weight behind Hillary Clinton’s candidacy, sometimes, as the Wikileaks revelations show, actively collaborating with the Clinton campaign. But Trump understandably misses a key point: the most important “rigging” of the election by the press happened during the Republican campaign season, when reporters and editors helped to make Trump the GOP nominee.

In the beginning, most people thought Trump’s presidential campaign was a joke. It was widely recognized that he would be the weakest candidate to oppose Hillary Clinton, with the possible exception of one or two no-hopers like Jim Gilmore or George Pataki. So what happened? The press made the story all about Donald Trump. He got, as others later calculated, billions of dollars worth of free publicity on television, and he dominated print coverage of the primaries as well. Other candidates had a hard time getting their messages in front of voters.

The attention that reporters paid to Trump helped even–perhaps especially–when it was negative. Being attacked by liberal journalists like Dana Milbank, to name just one of many examples, gave Trump credibility in the eyes of many Republican and independent voters.

So the liberal press built Donald Trump into the prime Republican contender, and eventual nominee. But note what the press did not do: it did not release any of the anti-Trump bombshells that seem to have clinched the election for Mrs. Clinton. NBC has had the infamous Access Hollywood tape for eleven years, but it came to light only in the last days of the campaign, when it could do the most to assure a Clinton victory. Why didn’t NBC leak the tape to the Washington Post during the primary season? In all likelihood, the answer is that the network didn’t want to damage Trump until it was too late for Republican voters to select a stronger candidate.

So Trump is right that the press is making a strong, and likely successful, effort to rig the election in favor of the Democrats. But we shouldn’t lose sight of the fact that the most important aspect of that “rigging” was relentlessly building up Trump during the primary season. If the GOP had nominated, say, Marco Rubio, he would today be cruising toward an easy victory over the appalling Hillary Clinton."

His latest video takes us deep into the dark side of the Democratic Party, where operatives, including at least one convicted criminal, do the bidding of the Democratic National Committee and the Hillary Clinton campaign.

The principal topic is violence–that is, the effort by the Democratic National Committee and the Clinton campaign to provoke violence at Donald Trump rallies. There are some shocking admissions, like “we have mentally ill people that we pay to do shit, make no mistake.” Then there is this memorable quote:

It doesn’t matter what the legal and ethics people say, we need to win this mother***er.

You may think the Democratic Party is corrupt, but you don’t know the half of it."
100718,1010,Trump’s new claim that Obama stole North Carolina in 2008 is bad. His campaign’s defense is worse.,https://thinkprogress.org/trump-claims-obama-stole-nc-his-campaigns-defense-is-even-worse-777e9c5bb748#.vyxk72za2,26,"In a speech in Green Bay, Wisconsin, on Monday night, Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump drilled down on his new favorite talking point_—_warnings that the election may be “rigged” against him.
In the speech, Trump alleged that “it is possible” that illegal votes from undocumented immigrants (who, although they pay taxes, are not allowed to vote) may have won President Obama the state of North Carolina in 2008.
“It could have provided the margin of victory,” Trump said.
There’s no credible evidence backing up Trump’s claim. Nonetheless, his campaign is backing him up_—_with even more misinformation.
In an interview with local Boston radio, Trump’s campaign co-chair Sam Clovis was asked if Trump’s unsubstantiated claims about North Carolina were “irresponsible.” Clovis said that instead, “it raises an issue.”
“I’ve done a lot of work and study in this area, so here’s what happens: you have the opportunity for illegal immigrants to come to the state, and the state loosens its laws to provide for individuals to get drivers licences in the state, illegal or otherwise,” Clovis said. Then, he alleged, once the undocumented immigrants have the photo ID, “what happens sometimes is that you are able to register to vote because you establish residency.”
Clovis’ defense of Trump’s comments is based on a wholly false premise: North Carolina does not allow undocumented immigrants to obtain drivers licences.
The relevant comments begin around 4:17: The twelve states that allow undocumented immigrants to obtain drivers licenses or authorization cards are: California, Colorado, Connecticut, Delaware, Hawaii, Illinois, Maryland, New Mexico, Nevada, Utah, Vermont and Washington, as well as the District of Columbia. Even in these states, however, the licenses are differentiated from citizens’ licenses, and do not allow cardholders to vote, and often expressly limited from being used as federal IDs.
In direct contrast to Clovis’ claims that laws in North Carolina are lax, the state’s Republican-controlled legislature pushed through an incredibly stringent package of voter laws after a key provision of the VRA was struck down in 2014. This omnibus law included a voter ID provision that advocates argue was designed to particularly suppress Democratic-leaning African-American votes.
A federal judge agreed: In July, the law was ruled unconstitutional for intentionally using voter ID provisions to discriminate by race.
There are two measures that seem like they might dovetail with Clovis’ claim, however, in reality, neither pans out. In 2015, a bill that would have allowed undocumented immigrants to obtain a form of a driver’s licence was raised in the North Carolina legislature. However, it also quickly died in the legislature, and never became law.
Even then, the proposed ID cards were not full driver’s licenses, but “restricted ID’s” that would look different than the standard license. It was proposed as a road-safety measure to encourage immigrants who drive vehicles to obtain a license and insurance.
Additionally, in some North Carolina cities, nonprofits and faith groups have provided undocumented immigrants with “FaithAction IDs,” which are unofficial identification cards that some cities law enforcement forces agreed to accept as a form of ID. This helps immigrants report crime and obtain medical care. That program came under fire earlier this year, when a bill was introduced in the Senate to prohibit the practice. These IDs are, again, visibly different from licenses and would not allow an immigrant to vote. Additionally, they have only been in circulation for the past 3 years_—_so even if Clovis was confused about the form of ID and the rights these unofficial IDs conferred, they would not have been in play in the 2008 election.
There is no evidence that voter fraud is a widespread problem, nor that the few cases of voter fraud that do exist could tip a presidential election. The few cases of voter fraud tallied by experts amount to less than a rounding error, and PolitiFact, assessing Trump’s Monday claim of “large scale voter fraud,” rated it “Pants on fire.”
“More people are struck by lightning or attacked by sharks than are accused of voter fraud,” the site’s fact checkers explain.
Trump’s own evidence for the claim was similarly flimsy. He relied tangentially on a 2014 Washington Post blog post from two political scientists that claimed that non-citizens (not necessarily undocumented immigrants) could have influenced the 2008 election. The blog, which was quickly seized upon by conservative sites such as Breitbart and the Drudge report, relied on data from an unscientific online survey, and quickly received widespread criticism from academics and other experts for its dubious methodology.
Additionally, President Obama would have won the 2008 election even without North Carolina."
100719,1010,"If the election is really rigged, 33 states are rigged by Republicans",https://thinkprogress.org/trump-election-rigging-by-gop-3bea26109db4#.46ssmjv69,26,"Donald Trump continued on Monday to push his claims that the election is “rigged” against him, falsely suggesting widespread voter fraud and raising the specter of a conspiracy of media outlets scheming to provide negative coverage of his candidacy. But while he may believe that he only way he could possibly lose would be for for “1.8 million deceased people” to cast ballots against him and an array of other other vote-rigging techniques, many of those who oversee elections in the states have pushed back against his claims.
And most of those chief elections officers are Republicans_—_some of whom have publicly endorsed Trump.
According to the National Conference of State Legislatures, 26 states have an elected secretary of state or lieutenant governor who oversee elections and 7 more have those officials share authority with a commission or board. Eight more states have a chief official selected by the legislature or governor; the rest are run by an appointed electoral commission of some sort.
In Hawaii, Illinois, New York, and Wisconsin, these are bipartisan boards. In other states, like Maryland and North Carolina, the majority on the boards goes to the current governor’s party.
In all, 29 states have GOP-controlled elections processes, representing 302 electoral votes. 17 states and the District of Columbia have a Democratic-controlled process, representing just 173 electors. The remaining 4 states, with a total of 63 electoral votes, have bipartisan boards.
In other words, if the election were truly “rigged,” it would have to be a Republican rig. Swing states like Florida, Iowa, Nevada, North Carolina, and Ohio are all overseen by GOP chief elections officials.
Ohio Secretary of State Jon Husted (R) and Idaho Secretary of State Lawrence Denney (R) have said they will vote for Trump. Kansas Secretary of State Kris Kobach (R) endorsed Trump in February. Iowa Secretary of State Paul Pate (R) even had Trump headline a 2015 campaign fundraiser for his own re-election. It seems unlikely these or other Republicans would secretly be working to rig an election for Hillary Clinton.
If anything, many of these Republican secretaries of state have moved to suppress the votes of Democrats and racial minorities_—_groups that are among the least likely to vote for Trump.
Perhaps this is why even Trump’s closest advisers are trying to push back against his claims. National campaign co-chair Sam Clovis told the Boston Herald on Tuesday, “I have a lot of faith in the secretaries of states across the country.” And Gov. Mike Pence (R-IN), Trump’s own running mate, said on Sunday that the campaign would accept the results of the election and that the only “sense of a rigged election” came from the “obvious bias in the national media.”
An earlier version of this map incorrectly flipped Alaska and Arkansas."
100720,1010,Trump’s voter intimidation squads could face a year in prison,https://thinkprogress.org/trumps-voter-intimidation-squads-could-face-a-year-in-prison-e0591231016b#.s71ca8fz2,26,"“You’ve got to go out,” Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump told his supporters in Pennsylvania earlier this month. “You’ve got to get your friends. And you’ve got to get everyone you know. And you got to watch your polling booths.”
The real-estate-developer-turned-white-nationalist speaks in thinly veiled code. He never quite tells his followers explicitly which neighborhoods they should target, or how aggressively they should “watch” voters. “I hear too many stories about Pennsylvania,” Trump warns. In “certain areas” he hears “too many bad stories, and we can’t lose an election because of you know what I’m talking about.”
While the openly racist nominee hasn’t given detailed marching orders to his supporters, some of them have heard a fairly clear message. The Boston Globe spoke to a Trump support who plans to engage in “racial profiling,” looking for “Mexicans. Syrians. People who can’t speak American” at the polls.
He hopes to make these voters “a little bit nervous.” Similarly, Talking Points Memo’s Tierney Sneed notes that “two Trump supporters in Virginia last week staged a 12-hour open carry “protest” outside a Democratic campaign office”_—_a potential preview of an Election Day tactic at polling places.
A pair of federal legal provisions, one civil and one criminal, confront this kind of conduct directly. Both prohibit conduct that “intimidates, threatens, coerces, or attempts to intimidate, threaten, or coerce, any other person for the purpose of interfering with the right of such other person to vote or to vote as he may choose.” The criminal version of this statute subjects violators to a fine and up to one year in prison.
Though there are fairly few court decisions explaining what constitutes voter intimidation under these laws, the few that do exist suggest that the law defines intimidation quite broadly. One case, for example, involved an African American insurance collector who was active in the Civil Rights Movement. White landowners refused to let him come onto their land, a restriction that made it impossible for him to do his job and ultimately required his employer to transfer him to another county.
A federal appeals court found that the landowners engaged in illegal voter intimidation if they prevented this man from coming onto their land to discourage his efforts to bring African Americans to the polls_—_even though property owners normally have an “almost unrestricted right” to exclude unwanted people from their land.
Other cases hold that a schoolteacher cannot be denied a job because their exercised their voting rights, and that landlords cannot sanction their tenants because those tenants assisted voting rights activists.
The law, in other words, has been applied to much more indirect methods of voter intimidation than a Trump supporter showing up at a polling place with a gun in order to scare away voters. That suggests that the individuals Trump is trying to deploy in order to “watch” the polls could be in a world of legal trouble if they heed their candidate’s call."

The forceful endorsement came in a letter signed by 70 Nobel laureates hailing from a variety of fields and making the case that Mrs. Clinton is the candidate who best understands the importance of investing in science and technology at a time when the world faces challenges on several fronts. The letter made no mention of Donald J. Trump, but it suggested that policies that show a lack of appreciation of scientific knowledge could damage America’s prestige and national security.

“We need a president who will support and advance policies that will enable science and technology to flourish in our country and to provide the basis of important policy decisions,” they wrote.
The letter specifically mentions “the devastating effects of debilitating diseases such as Alzheimer’s disease and cancer, the need for alternative sources of energy, and climate change and its consequences.” It also points out that “sensible immigration and education policies are crucial to the continued preeminence of the U.S. scientific work force.” In short, Not Donald Trump.

Last week, several media organizations reported that Priorities was readying ads in key Senate contests and on Tuesday, they confirmed it. Priorities says that they’ll launch ads in New Hampshire and Pennsylvania tying Sens. Kelly Ayotte and Pat Toomey to Trump. The group did not say how much they’ll spend in each state, or if they plan to get involved in any other Senate races.

Polls show that while both Ayotte and Toomey are in tight races, they’re still doing much better than Trump in their states. However, a recent DSCC poll argued that, when voters are informed that their GOP Senate candidate used to back Trump but only recently withdrew their support, Team Red lost critical support. Ayotte infamously spent most of the campaign saying she was voting for Trump, and only dumped him after his “grab them by the pussy!” video surfaced; Toomey continues to be evasive about who he plans to vote for in the presidential race.  

Both Republicans are absolutely aware that if too many voters associate them with The Donald, they’re in trouble. Toomey recently launched a strange ad where he halfheartedly noted that he has “a lot of disagreements with Donald Trump,” though he didn’t provide any actual examples. Ayotte and Toomey’s Democratic foes, Maggie Hassan and Katie McGinty, have been airing their own ads tethering the two senators to Trump. Priorities has run some of the most effective commercials of the cycle that used Trump’s own words against him. If they can use Trump’s many awful comments to drag down Ayotte and Toomey, Democrats will have a lot to smile about on election night."

Look way down. Far below the dinosaur skeletons, miles of lava, and every bolgia of Hell, Steve Bannon is still digging. Still looking for ways to make this election worse.

According to Bannon, the news that President Obama's Trump-supporting half-brother Malik Obama is attending Wednesday's debate is ""just an appetizer.""
Doesn’t “appetizer” imply that something must first be appetizing? But hey, we’re all here, breathing in the smoke and brimstone. What do you have for us, Steve?

Trump will be bringing guests who ""expose Bill and Hillary's sordid past,"" Bannon told CNN as he arrived in Las Vegas for the debate late Tuesday night.

When asked who comes up with the ideas to invite these guests, Bannon said, ""We're a team.""
Since Trump already paraded a string of Bill Clinton accusers at the last debate, which failed to drive Hillary from the stage, and the “surprise” of Benghazi mom Pat Smith is already blown, just what is making Bannon wiggle his sweaty toes inside his Crocs? Rumors are that this time the Trump campaign plans to reach deep into the right-hand pocket of black helicopter land. Ah, yes. How droll. Or is that drool? Either way, this is certain to win over swing voters.

No matter where you live, sign up with MoveOn to call voters in swing states from the comfort of your home. Get out the vote and take nothing for granted!

The funny thing is, Bannon probably thinks that turning the debate into a low-rent sideshow will bring in voters. Because that’s exactly how he ran Breitbart. The lower he went, the more his numbers went up.

""What the media misses is the amount of anger that's out there. Trump didn't create that,"" Bannon said.

He suggested that a visit to a Trump rally would confirm this.
It’s not that Trump’s rallies reveal a secret level of anger. It’s that they incubate racism, bigotry, and pure hate.

Bannon disputed that on Tuesday night, saying ""the media thinks this is an ethno-nationalist movement"" akin to the National Front in France, but it's ""much more of a populist movement.""
A populist movement—of white people who think of themselves as Christians. The Trump campaign at every level has become so self-contained, so insular, that they can’t see that right behind the last “Hillary for Prison” sign is a whole nation. One that’s about to reject Trump, reject them, and show just how unpopular their “populism” really is."

Fact-Check: TRUE

This factoid is a hardy perennial on both Left and Right, with the latter sometimes invoking it to argue that President Obama has done a very poor job of combating “income inequality,” or that Obama’s presidency proves not even the most dedicated leftist can fix income inequality through redistributionist government policies.

Various estimates have held that the “top one percent” received 90 or 95 percent of the income gains during the Obama presidency. It should be noted, however, that the gains became more evenly spread over the last two years, as the job market began shaking off its paralysis.

There have been many challenges to the “Top one percent got most of the income gains” statistic over the years, including the argument that measuring income is not the most accurate way to determine economic inequality.

Also, the recovery of the stock market after the 2008 financial crisis was a major reason for these income benefits accruing to the rich, and a healthy stock market is often touted by supporters of President Obama as proof that his policies were working. It’s rather hypocritical for Democrats to attack the logical end result of something they’ve presented as an economic benefit: people who own stocks making a lot of money from the recovering stock market. Some of those same people lost a lot of money when it went down.

But Clinton portrayed these top earners as essentially criminals who must be punished. She certainly wasn’t blaming Obama’s policies for the situation:

We are going to go where the money is. Most of the gains in the last years since the Great Recession have gone to the very top. So we are going to have the wealthy pay their fair share. We’re going to have corporations make a contribution greater than they are now to our country.

Yes, top earners indisputably received the lion’s share of income growth from the post-2008 recovery, but the reasons why are far more complicated than the purely predatory behavior Clinton implies."

In particular, the agent, who was part of the State Department’s Bureau of Diplomatic Security, said Clinton routinely refused to ride in armored limousines with U.S. ambassadors, “instead choosing to be accompanied by her Chief of Staff, Human Abedin.”

“This frequently resulted in complaints by ambassadors who were insulted and embarrassed by this breach of protocol,” explained the FBI source, as quoted by the UK Daily Mail.

The agent described Abedin, who was technically Clinton’s Deputy Chief of Staff, as holding “much more power” over the Secretary of State’s staff and schedule than previous occupants of the position. In fact, the source believed “Abedin herself was often responsible for overriding security and diplomatic protocols on behalf of Clinton.”

The security officer also complained that Clinton used her secretary of state position to kickstart her presidential campaign, traveling with “hand-picked media who would present her in favorable light in order to garner political support,” and sometimes violating security protocols to get photo ops.

According to this source, Clinton sometimes overruled security recommendations for political purposes, which jeopardized her safety — along with that of her staff, media, and security detail.

The New York Post adds that these FBI interviews revealed that State Department security personnel “so disliked Hillary Clinton that many left the agency or asked to be reassigned.”

This testimony came from the same source mentioned by the UK Daily Mail. The agent “explained that Clinton’s treatment of DS agents on her protective detail was so contemptuous that many of them sought reassignment or employment elsewhere.”

“Prior to Clinton’s tenure, being an agent on the Secretary of State’s protective detail was seen as an honor and privilege reserved for senior agents. However, by the end of Clinton’s tenure, it was staffed largely with new agents because it was difficult to find senior agents willing to work for her,” the source claimed, adding that Secret Service agents also complained about working with Mrs. Clinton."
100726,1002,"Donald Trump Wins Third Debate — Finally, a Fair Fight",http://www.breitbart.com/big-government/2016/10/19/donald-trump-wins-third-debate-finally-fair-fight/,27,"Donald Trump and Hillary Clinton each delivered impressive performances on Wednesday night, but the night belonged to the Republican challenger, who stuck to a repeated theme: that Clinton is to blame for the very problems she promises to fix.
Clinton’s lines were well-rehearsed, but blunted somewhat by the fact that many of them were old. On several occasions, she was forced to filibuster — such as when moderator Chris Wallace asked her to explain her dream of “open borders,” which she revealed to a Brazilian bank in one of the confidential speeches released recently by Wikileaks. (Clinton’s response was to claim, rather implausibly, that she was talking only about “energy,” and then to claim Trump was helping Russian hackers.)

Wallace, in an understated way, was the star of the night: he was the only fair-minded moderator of the entire presidential series, who posed tough questions to both candidates and scolded the audience when it favored one side or the other. He also pressed Clinton on her conflicts of interest at the Clinton Foundation, refusing to allow her to wriggle away from the question by talking about the good work her charity does. And he challenged some of Trump’s inaccurate past statements on Syria.

With — finally! — a fair fight at hand, Trump showcased his strengths. He was, as one campaign source told Breitbart News shortly before the event, calm but aggressive, showing the fighting spirit that lifted him past the Republican field (though perhaps interrupting too often). Clinton, too, stood her ground on style, if not always on substance. She presented herself as a capable and experienced official with a flair for details — even if she deployed those details as often to obscure as to explain.

It was, in many ways, the slugfest that millions tuned in to see. There were no knockouts, though the challenger won on points, and showed improvement over the three debates.

Whether that is enough to catch her in the polls remains to be seen."
100727,1003,What Motivates Hillary Clinton And Donald Trump To Run For President?,http://www.huffingtonpost.com/jerald-podair/what-motivates-hillary-cl_b_12559814.html?utm_hp_ref=politics,27,"“Why do you want to be president?” Simple question, right? And not a particularly difficult one to answer for most presidential candidates throughout our nation’s history. Think of any of them, even the losers, and their motivations come readily to mind. Johnson, Goldwater, Reagan, Mondale, and McGovern and further back in time, FDR, Hoover, and Truman. And Obama today. They could all tell you why they ran. Their reasons were invariably grounded in ideology, in deeply held ideas about the kind of nation America should be. Today, when we call a candidate an “ideologue” (Bernie Sanders or Ted Cruz, for example) we usually don’t intend it as a compliment. But possessing an ideological core means not that you will do anything to win, but the opposite: that there are lines you will not cross, things you will not do, because if you crossed them and did them, you wouldn’t be “you.”

But what if you don’t know who “you” are? What if the reason you are running for president has less to do with what you believe than with defeating your enemies, confounding those who doubted you, or proving you’re a winner? What if you viewed your campaign not as a battle between competing sets of ideas, but as a game - on the level of a mega-sized sporting event - in which defeat is not merely unpalatable but unthinkable, unacceptable, and unendurable? Ideologues, for better or worse, have ideas, principles and identities. Candidates without them have only their egos to guide them.

Which brings us to this year’s two most popular presidential candidates. Why do they want to be president? How would they answer that question? Could they? I doubt it. “Make America Great Again” and “Stronger Together” cannot disguise what truly motivates both Donald Trump and Hillary Clinton: defeating enemies, confounding doubters, and winning. They want to be president because, well, they want to be president.

Sound familiar? It should. Because both Clinton and Trump bear an unsettling resemblance to another presidential candidate unfettered by clear ideological boundaries: Richard Nixon. In The Selling of the President, 1968, Joe McGinniss observed that after over two decades on the national political scene Nixon “was still felt by his own staff to be in need of time ‘to work out firmly in his own mind that vision of the nation’s future that he wants to be identified with.’” Garry Wills, who plumbed Nixon’s depths exhaustively for his Nixon Agonistes, viewed him as “the least ‘authentic’ man alive.” Nixon had no ideological center, only ego - resentment, ambition, pride, and entitlement. And when faced with the greatest moral challenge of his presidency, the Watergate crisis, Nixon had no core beliefs on which to rely, no lines he would not cross. He was left only with raw survival instinct. He simply could not let his enemies win. There was no other reason to be president than to win, win, win.

So instead of coming clean about the Watergate burglary and suffering the immediate political consequences - which while harmful in the short run would in all likelihood not have affected the result of the 1972 presidential election in any appreciable way - Nixon chose to stonewall. Devoid of ideological bearings, reliant solely on a will to power for its own sake, it was all he knew how to do. Nixon, of course, paid a high price for his ideological emptiness. But we paid a higher one.

It is unlikely that a Trump or Clinton presidency will end the way Richard Nixon’s did - let’s hope not - but when your motivation for running for the presidency is based almost exclusively on a burning desire to beat the other side, the chances things will end badly increase exponentially. So listen for an answer to the question “Why do you want to be president?” from Donald Trump and Hillary Clinton over the next few weeks. If you don’t get one that’s plausible, it’s a bad sign. And next time you hear a presidential candidate derided as an “ideologue,” don’t automatically write them off. When the inevitable crisis occurs, their ideology may offer the moral compass and belief system to do the right thing - for us."
100728,1003,A Look At The 2016 Election And Days Gone By,http://www.huffingtonpost.com/jeff-sorensen/a-look-at-the-2016-electi_b_12547010.html?utm_hp_ref=politics,27,"Donald Trump is quite the line in the dirt between people during this election season. I have never heard such insane things coming from both sides in my entire life. Sure, I can circle back to when I was in high school, but this is a different ball game. What we’re seeing now is almost like satire to the point where you could introduce Poe’s Law — not knowing if it’s real or fake.

Having Bush run against Gore felt like a slam dunk for Gore until Florida botched it all. Then Nader’s third-party bid helped dive the country into Hell for 8 years. If you don’t think that Bush was a pretty bad president, all you have to do is look it up from a point of view of an outsider. What would an alien thing about the policies if the alien knew about humanity, but didn’t care either way?

Even high school me knew that going into Iraq was stupid. However, there was 9/11. That tragedy put everyone in America into a tailspin:

Something bad happened, but then going to war with one country with false reasoning connected to the tragedy, and then go to war with the same reason, but it becomes pointless since the strategy was idiotic. The Taliban was a nightmare, but using 9/11 to attack them was a bad idea. Saddam is a crazy dictator, but using falsified information on WMD’s to attack is criminal. Why not just use actual information gathered to bring them down. Saddam was a monster, and the Taliban was equally barbaric. The world would probably nod in agreement. The alien would look and think that it’s too narrow of a position. What about the massacres and rape in many African places? What about North Korea having huge death camps and starving citizens? The alien would realize within a few minutes of knowing about the region that one has resources where the other does not.

Now, in 2016, we’re stuck after having a pretty great President Obama in office for nearly 8 years. Was he perfect? No, but he also had his hands tied the entire time since being a black, liberal president got him a lot of NO when he would put forth a bill. It’s gotten so bad that the guy he chose for the new Supreme Court Justice hasn’t even been given a hearing even though most GOP members think he’s a great choice. That’s like turning down a pizza you love solely because the person who ordered it is someone you hate because of political reasons. You love the pizza, but why not eat it because of the guy who ordered it? It won’t change the taste of the pizza for years to come, so what the hell?

What started as a joke has turned into a reality. Donald Trump is basically every descriptor for someone who is against basic human and civil rights. Every speech is filled with hate, evil, lack of facts, lack of a vocabulary past the 3rd grade, and basic lack of human decency. Every day comes with breaking news of something horrible he said. There is so much vitriol he has spewed in the past that it becomes daunting to document it all within an article. It would just be bullet points of each day where he said something baffling, and then the media covering it, and then Trump tweeting about bias even though the media just played the clip of things Trump said or tweeted on a loop all day.

What about Hillary? Well, to say she is the lesser of two evils is sadly a truth everyone has to get used to. If she were against any other candidate in this race, her e-mail and Wikileaks scandals would be a nail in her campaign’s coffin. After everything came out, it wasn’t really as bad as it seemed. As more comes out, it really doesn’t seem that bad in comparison to just about everything Trump has said or did since he could learn how to talk. I would prefer Bernie Sanders over both, but since he is out, I guess Hillary is the less dangerous choice. I’d go for the “Won’t Obliterate The World” option every time if that is what’s given.

What would an alien do if it were given these two options? Well, the alien would probably ask why the hell the entire planet was separated so much and at war when it’s just a piece of dust in the scheme of the universe. The alien would also ask why one candidate wanted to cause havoc while the other wants to try and keep everything together. If I’m the alien, I would bounce out of the solar system to a more civilized star."
100729,1003,Trump’s Campaign Proves That America Is Rigged Against The Poor,http://www.huffingtonpost.com/zachary-parker/donald-trump-is-actually-_b_12537322.html?utm_hp_ref=politics,27,"For many Americans, the 2016 presidential election has left a bad taste in their mouths. More common than talk about Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton’s email transgressions, repugnancy over Republican nominee Donald Trump’s inflammatory and often downright problematic rhetoric, or vapid conversations surrounding third party candidates Jill Stein and Gary Johnson, is a shared sense by many that America deserves better.

Perhaps most stunning in an election where the two leading candidates could not possibly be further apart on most issues is the fact that our collective political conversation continues to devolve into a shouting match - often in response to Trump’s latest vexatious remarks and unrelated to the major policy decisions that lie ahead. Trump’s claims have run the gamut - from positing that global warming is a Chinese created hoax, to suggesting the Clintons killed former aide Vince Foster, to praising world dictators, to questioning the legitimacy and citizenship of President Barack Obama, to commenting on women’s looks, religious freedom, and even their menstrual cycle. Buried within many of Trump’s assertions is his belief that the presidential race in which he finds himself and surely the country itself is rigged. Love or hate him, Trump is absolutely correct.

Trump himself, and his pedestrian campaign, fully represent the ways in which America is rigged against the poor in this country.
And to be clear, talk centering on the ways in which American institutions are rigged is nothing new. Democratic superstars Elizabeth Warren and former presidential candidate Bernie Sanders have moved millions with fiery speeches about the ways in which the American system is rigged against the “little guy.” The difference between these stalwart rebukes and Trump’s whining, however, is in the subject. Warren and Sanders have raised awareness to the ways in which American financial systems are rigged against the average American, while Trump’s rigging claims focus solely on himself. Narcissism aside, though, Trump is spot-on. Ironically enough, Trump himself and his pedestrian campaign, fully represent the ways in which America is rigged against the poor in this country.

Trump serves as the current poster child for just how power and wealth provide unparalleled access to success in this country - and apparently the ability to run for president, absent any qualitfications. Trump’s family wealth provided him the opportunity to attend prep schools (e.g. the Kew-Forest School of Forest Hills, NY) and some of the nation’s premier collegiate institutions. That same wealth allowed Trump’s father to gift him a “small loan” of $1 million to jumpstart his now global business, which thereby allowed Trump to provide his children similar access to the world stage. Wealth does indeed beget wealth. And to be clear, no one should fault Trump for being wealthy; however, his success does beg the question: what allows for the current and long-lasting racial disparities in generational wealth.

Without question, the racial disparities that exist today stem directly from 400+ years of free labor white families stole from enslaved Africans. The persistence of these racial disparities is arguably exasperated by the rigging of American systems that has led to the disproportionate incarceration of American minorities (recently highlighted in “13th” by Ava DuVernay) and segregation of American minorities in communities of poverty with limited access to quality schools. It is widely known that while poverty does not correlate to children’s intelligence or ability to learn and achieve at high levels, it does directly correlate to children’s preparedness when entering kindergarten and later school success. (The good news is that the gap in kindergarten readiness between affluent and poor children is seemingly shrinking). It is also widely known that one’s educational success directly correlates with their ability to attend college, lifetime earning potential (thereby the economy), social and civic engagement (thereby voter turnout), lifelong health (thereby healthcare), and ability to move freely in the circles in which Trump and Clinton, among many others, find themselves.

Why then hasn’t there been much more conversation about education in this presidential election? Or any for that matter? Perhaps it is because it is not as sensational or tantalizing as Clinton’s emails or the myriad of sex scandals in which Trump finds himself. Perhaps the reason is much more nefarious, in that those with power and wealth remain most concerned with maintaining their societal position and ensuring that their children have access to America’s most elite schools. Not to mention, our capitalistic society requires a constant “under class.” Meanwhile, American politicians only seem interested in symbolic and/or incremental change versus system overhauls - the likes Warren and Sanders call for or that would be needed to ensure all children in this country are afforded an excellent education. As a result, the most disadvantaged students - those segregated in failing schools with ineffective teachers and leaders - often students of color - remain invisible in the current political circus.

“I am invisible, understand, simply because people refuse to see me. Like the bodiless heads you see sometimes in circus sideshows, it is as though I have been surrounded by mirrors of hard, distorting glass. When they approach me they see only my surroundings, themselves or figments of their imagination, indeed, everything and anything except me.” - Ralph Ellison (Invisible Man)

Every major political issue Clinton and Trump claim to care about can be tied to the fight for equal access to quality education for all American students. And while Trump in all of his mediocrity leaves much to be desired, his claims that America is unjust and its systems rigged ring true - even if Trump himself has not or perhaps cannot wrap his mind around how. The deafening silence regarding issues of education equity is not a sign of how the system is rigged; it is in fact one of the many ways the system remains rigged."
100730,1004,'Nets Agree: Trump's Comments About Election Results Overshadow All Else,http://talkingpointsmemo.com/livewire/cable-networks-trump-refusal-to-accept-election-result-moment-of-the-night,27,"Hosts on Fox News, CNN, and MSNBC were all in agreement mere minutes after the end of the final presidential debate on Wednesday: Donald Trump's unwillingness to commit to conceding the election if he loses overshadowed every other subject covered over the course of the evening.

""By far, the number one discussed issue on social media tonight was Donald Trump's unwillingness to accept the legitimacy of the results of this election,"" Fox host Megyn Kelly said. ""Saying I'll wait and see, I'll keep you in suspense, which had the online equivalent of a jaw drop among many Republicans even.""

""Considering that Governor Pence said the same thing, and so did Ivanka Trump,"" co-host Bret Baier agreed.

The conversation continued through a panel discussion in which Fox News analyst Brit Hume characterized Trump's refusal to commit to conceding as ""the headline out of this debate.""

""That doesn't happen usually in America,"" Hume said. ""It's a big deal.""

On MSNBC, Brian Williams described Trump's response as ""the disqualifying moment for Americans who believe in and respect a peaceful transition of power"" right after the debate ended.

It ""came along with an audience gasp in the room,"" Williams added. ""Not sure quite what we've witnessed in terms of democracy tonight, Rachel.""

Co-host Rachel Maddow agreed, calling it ""the moment of the debate, maybe the moment of this whole portion of the campaign.""

""First time a major party candidate has done this, has said this,"" Williams said, adding that Trump was ""making history prior to an election.""

Speaking to Maddow and Williams, Republican strategist Steve Schmidt said that Trump's comments were a ""clear and present danger to our constitutional order"" and were ""unprecedented in the history of the country.""

""I think that's the headline and that's the body of the story too, in a way,"" Williams added.

On CNN, Wolf Blitzer called the remark ""clearly the headline, Donald Trump saying he may not accept the result of this presidential election.""

""One of the most stunning things I've ever heard in a presidential debate, ever,"" Jake Tapper agreed. ""To suggest that he might not accept the results of the election that we're about to hold in fewer than three weeks was staggering."""
100731,1004,Ivanka Deflects From 'Rigged' Election To Deny Family Business Is Suffering,http://talkingpointsmemo.com/livewire/ivanka-trump-election-rigged,27,"Ivanka Trump deflected a question Wednesday about her father's claims that the November election will be rigged by changing the subject to deny reports that the family business has suffered because of his presidential campaign.

During her interview on stage at the Fortune Most Powerful Women Summit, Trump was asked about her father's claims that election will be rigged against him. She answered by taking a jab at the media.

""I will tell you that the media has been vicious and there's a lot of business people in the room,"" she said. ""We've had articles written about us by the business press where we say, hmm, that wasn't exactly fair, the fact check, there's a few things off but this has been a different level.""

Trump went on to take issue with a New York Times article that made the claim that Trump businesses was suffering because of the election. She said that was an example of a bias she's only recently noticed.

""It's demoralizing when you're working very hard and you have teams working tremendously hard to read these things,"" she said. ""So I think the bias is very, very real and I don't think I would have said this to you even a year ago but I'm seen it too many times. It's tremendous.""

Later in the speech, however, Trump said that her father will accept the outcome of the election no matter what happens.

""He’ll either win or he won’t win and I believe he’ll accept the outcome either way,” she said.

The rest of Trump's interview did not run into controversial territory, but a surprising meeting backstage lit Twitter on fire. Trump was snapped backstage talking to Anita Hill, who famously testified before the U.S. Senate that Clarence Thomas sexually harassed her during the time he was being confirmed to the Supreme Court. Hill had spoken just before Trump at the event, and it was not clear what they discussed backstage."
100732,1004,Newt Gingrich: ‘Little Trump’ Lashes Out ‘Uncontrollably’ When Criticized,http://talkingpointsmemo.com/livewire/newt-gingrich-little-trump-acts-uncontrollably-when-criticized,27,"Newt Gingrich expounded on his theory of Donald Trump’s bifurcated personality on Tuesday, explaining that the “very sensitive” Little Trump lashes out “almost uncontrollably” when criticized.

The former House speaker and top Trump surrogate told the Washington Examiner’s David Drucker that the Republican nominee loses his cool in response to “anything which attacks his own sense of integrity or his own sense of respectability, and he reacts very intensely, almost uncontrollably, to those kinds of situations.”

These rather harsh comments follow a Fox News interview last week in which Gingrich claimed that the Little Trump was “frankly pathetic” for attacking House Speaker Paul Ryan (R-WI) for neglecting to congratulate him on his performance in the second presidential debate.

While Gingrich noted that he admired Big Trump for disrupting the presidential campaign with his unorthodox behavior and far-reaching policy ideas, he said that the real estate mogul too often became embroiled in embarrassing public spats.

“There’s also a part of his personality that sometimes gets involved in petty things that make no sense, and I think that that’s what I was talking about when I talk about there’s a big Trump and a little Trump,” Gingrich said.

“The big Trump is a historic figure talking about historic ideas,” he went on. “The little Trump gets involved at a personality level.”

Gingrich claimed that his candidate remains a “remarkable and a very formidable player” despite his recent attacks on everyone from the Republican House speaker to a former Miss Universe.

Other Trump surrogates have also publicly criticized their candidate of late. 
New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie (R) said he was “disappointed” by Trump’s defiant response to a leaked recording in which he can be heard boasting about groping women, while campaign manager Kellyanne Conway said she would not have taken Trump’s approach of mocking the looks of the women who have accused him of sexual harassment."
100733,1005,Watch the Best Moments From the Final Presidential Debate,http://www.motherjones.com/politics/2016/10/watch-best-moments-final-presidential-debate,27,"The debates between Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump are finally over. And they will go down as unprecedentedly nasty, incoherent, and bizarre political theater. The final debate, Wednesday night in Las Vegas, featured what will go down as one of the enduring legacies of Trump’s campaign: his refusal to promise to accept the election results on November 8. As moderator Chris Wallace of Fox News himself noted, the peaceful transition of power is one of the bedrock principles of American democracy.

Beyond Trump's stunning comments about the election results, the debate featured many noteworthy—and vicious—moments. Trump hurled insults at Clinton, at one point calling her a ""nasty woman."" Clinton, well prepared as always, peppered her answers with attacks on Trump's record, such as his use of Chinese steel to build his hotel in Las Vegas. As MSNBC host Lawrence O'Donnell noted after the debate, there were ""just so many things to be astounded by.""

Here are the most astounding moments of the night:

Trump says Rove v. Wade will ""automatically"" be overturned if he's elected president. While the two candidates discussed their approach to the Supreme Court, Donald Trump tried to avoid clarifying his stance on abortion rights but essentially conceded that he would seek to appoint Supreme Court justices who would overturn Roe v. Wade. ""Well, if that would happen, because I am pro-life and I will be appointing pro-life judges, I would think that that would go back to the individual states,"" Trump said when asked if he'd aim to reverse Roe. When Wallace tried to pin him down, Trump said, ""If we put another two or perhaps three justices on, that will happen. And that will happen automatically in my opinion because I am putting pro-life justices on the court."" Trump describes late-term abortion in gruesome terms. Trump took a stand against late-term abortion by describing it in bizarre, bloody, and medically incorrect fashion. ""If you go with what Hillary is saying, in the ninth month you can take the baby and rip the baby out of the womb of the mother just prior to the birth of the baby,"" Trump claimed. ""Now, you can say that that's okay, and Hillary can say that that's okay, but it's not okay with me. Because based on what she's saying and based on where she's going and where she's been, you can take the baby and rip the baby out of the womb in the ninth month, on the final day. And that's not acceptable."" Clinton defends her position on late-term abortion. In a rebuttal to Trump's assertion that late-term abortion constitutes ripping a fetus from the womb days before the pregnant woman's due date, Clinton defended her politically thorny position that late-term abortion should be legal. ""Well, that is not what happens in these cases,"" Clinton said. ""And using that kind of scare rhetoric is just terribly unfortunate. You should meet with some of the women that I've met with. Women I've known over the course of my life. This is one of the worst possible choices that any woman and her family has to make.""

Clinton accuses Trump of ""choking"" in meeting with the Mexican president. Clinton called Trump out for not sticking by his anti-immigration rhetoric when he traveled south of the border to meet with Mexico’s president at the end of August. ""When it comes to the wall that Donald talks about building, he went to Mexico,"" she said. ""He had a meeting with the Mexican president. Didn't even raise it. He choked, then got into a Twitter war because the Mexican president said, we're not paying for that wall."" Clinton goes after Trump for using cheap, undocumented labor. The Democratic candidate also attacked Trump for exploiting immigration laws in his own business. ""Donald knows a lot about this,"" she said. ""He used undocumented labor to build the Trump Tower. He underpaid undocumented workers, and when they complained, he basically said what a lot of employers do: You complain, I'll get you deported. I want to get everybody out of the shadows, get the economy working and not let employers like Donald exploit undocumented workers, which hurts them and also hurts American workers."" Trump to Clinton: ""No, you're the puppet."" In one of the stranger moments of the debate, the candidates found themselves debating who was a puppet of a foreign dictator. When the issue of recent email hacks—which US intelligence agencies have traced to Russia, but whose origin Trump refused to concede—were raised, Trump defended himself by saying he had no association with Putin. ""I don't know Putin,"" Trump said. ""He said nice things about me. If we got along well, that would be good.""

Clinton didn’t quite disagree with that assessment and said that Putin would ""rather have a puppet as president.""

""No, you're the puppet,"" Trump fired back. Trump refuses to say whether he will accept the results of the election. Wallace addressed Trump's assertion, which he repeats at rallies across the country, that the election is going to be rigged, asking Trump point-blank whether he would accept the results on November 8. Trump would not promise that. ""I will tell you at the time,"" Trump said. ""I will keep you in suspense."" Trump says all the assault allegations against him are Clinton's doing. When Wallace pushed Trump on the string of women who have stepped forward since the last debate to accuse Trump of sexual assault or other unwanted contact, Trump tossed it aside and put all the blame at Clinton’s feet. ""I believe, Chris, that she got these people to step forward,"" he said. ""If it wasn't—they get their 10 minutes of fame. But they were all totally—it was all fiction. It was lies and it was fiction."" Clinton: ""I mean who does that? It just was astonishing."" Clinton had ample opportunities to apply this line. But in this case, Clinton said it in discussing Trump's charitable foundation and the fact that Trump used the foundation—and other people’s donations to it—to buy a giant portrait of himself. Trump claims the military operation to free Mosul from ISIS was done to help Clinton win. In a stemwinder about foreign policy, Trump posited that the military operation that began this week to free Mosul, Iraq's second-largest city, from ISIS control was undertaken in order to help Clinton win the presidential election. ""The only reason they did it is because she is running for the office of president,"" Trump said. ""She wanted to look good for the election, so they're going in."" Clinton responded that Trump's suggestion was another example of his conspiracy theories.

""I'm just amazed that he seems to think that the Iraqi government and our allies and everybody else launched the attack on Mosul to help me in this election,"" she said. ""But that's how Donald thinks, you know. He always is looking for some conspiracy."" Wallace calls out Trump for lying in past debates. Wallace, who said prior to the debate that he would not be fact-checking, pointedly called out Trump when asking a question about the military battle playing out for the Syrian city of Aleppo. Trump on Clinton: ""Such a nasty woman."" Near the end of the debate, Clinton was explaining that she wants to protect social security by raising payroll taxes on the wealthy. She quipped that Trump might try to get out of paying more payroll taxes—referring to widespread reporting that Trump may not have paid federal income taxes for nearly two decades by using tax loopholes. As Clinton spoke, Trump leaned into his microphone and said, ""such a nasty woman."" "
100734,1005,"Seriously, It Looks Like TrumpTV Just Launched",http://www.motherjones.com/politics/2016/10/trump-tv-facebook-live,27,"There's a ""news crawl,"" broadcast graphics, pretty decent audio, campaign ads, and a 200,000-plus audience. As the candidates prepared for a monumental political tussle on-stage in Las Vegas for the third and final presidential debate, Donald Trump posted this Facebook Live video, with the accompanying comment: ""If you’re tired of biased, mainstream media reporting (otherwise known as Crooked Hillary’s super PAC), tune into my Facebook Live broadcast."" Is this the start of Trump TV?"
100735,1005,2015 Was Actually an Exceptionally Safe Year for Cops,http://www.motherjones.com/politics/2016/10/fbi-police-deaths-line-duty-data,27,"Last year was one of the safest years to be a police officer in more than a decade, according to new FBI data on deaths in the line of duty. In 2015, 86 police officers were killed on the job, 41 by ""felonious acts."" The rest died in accidents. Ten fewer officers were killed as the result of a crime last year than in 2014, 31 fewer than in 2011, and 7 fewer than in 2006.

The numbers counter the narrative being pushed by GOP nominee Donald Trump, police groups, and many conservative politicians and pundits—that America has faced a surge since late 2014 in anti-police violence, instigated by the Black Lives Matter movement. After the attack on police in Dallas, for example, several police groups blamed Black Lives Matter for a ""war on cops.""'

However, according to the Officer Down Memorial Page, a website that keeps a running tally of officers killed in the line of duty, cop killings are up for 2016. At least 63 cops have been killed by criminal acts so far this year—22 more than in all of last year, with more than 10 weeks left on the calendar. (Eight of those deaths were the result of the targeted attacks on police in Dallas and Baton Rouge.)

According to the FBI's most recent data on nationwide employment of police officers, there were about 628,000 sworn officers in 2014. You can read the FBI's full 2015 report on line-of-duty deaths here."
100736,1006,The “leavin’ it all on the field” third presidential debate livetweet thread,http://hotair.com/archives/2016/10/19/leavin-field-third-presidential-debate-livetweet-thread/,27,"Normally we pre-game these things by talking strategy. What “strategy” is left for Trump to employ, though? What can he say tonight that’s going to change the game? The most ominous thing about the last debate was that his performance improved from the first one, Clinton was mediocre by all accounts, and she still won handily in the scientific polls afterward. It may be that some critical mass of voters has stopped taking him seriously, which means there’s nothing short of Clinton fainting again that might move the needle. I think his best play is to surprise everyone by going out there and sticking firmly to issues. Talk about term limits and ethical reform, talk immigration and crime committed by illegal aliens, talk about Clinton’s emails and her coziness with Wall Street in the Wikileaks revelations, and drive home the idea, as he once memorably put it, that nothing will change if you vote for her. Instead, he’s going to get sidetracked with the “Access Hollywood” tape and the sexual-assault allegations against him, and he’ll probably try to turn that around on Bill Clinton, and it’ll do nothing for him just like it did nothing at the second debate. His biggest liability by far is that he’s seen as not qualified for the office, especially in terms of his temperament. Logically, then, the best thing he could do to help himself would be to show composure, not take any bait, and drill down on Clinton’s corruption. But like I say, it’s probably too late for that. People have been watching him hourly on cable news for 16 months. One good 90-minute display isn’t going to move eight percent in the polls.

The alternative is that he goes out there and sets everything on fire. As of late this afternoon, news is circulating on Twitter that Leslie Millwee, the reporter who came forward to Breitbart about Bill Clinton’s assaults on her, will be at the debate. Danney Williams, who claims to be Clinton’s son via an affair and whom Drudge has been plugging endlessly for the last few weeks, is also in Vegas today to announce that he’s filing a paternity suit against Clinton. Whether he’ll be at the debate is unclear, but Sarah Palin’s apparently going to be there and Trump’s already announced that Obama’s half-brother will also be his guest in attendance — for what purpose, I have no idea. If Juanita Broaddrick’s account of what Bill Clinton did to her isn’t enough to drive voters away from Hillary, virtually nothing scandal-related will be. Maybe there is no “strategy” tonight beyond simply trying to rattle Hillary in various ways as a form of fan service. If Team Trump believes the race is over, Trump might as well make his base happy by goofing on Clinton in ways that other Republicans would avoid. Reminding them that he’s a “fighter” won’t win an election but it might cement an audience for TrumpTV next year. We’ll see. As for why Clinton decided to show up tonight given how little she has to gain from it, I don’t know. Probably she feels that she needs to show she’s a “fighter” too.

Here’s your Twitter widget for live reaction throughout the debate from the Hot Air and Townhall staffs. Ed will have a separate thread up for live commentary elsewhere on the site. Exit question from the Republican nominee, commenting on the Democratic nominee in 2008: “I think she is going to go down at a minimum as a great senator. I think she is a great wife to a president. And I think Bill Clinton was a great president.”"
100737,1006,YouGov: Paul Ryan’s favorable rating among Republicans drops 28 points — in a week,http://hotair.com/archives/2016/10/19/yougov-paul-ryans-favorable-rating-among-republicans-drops-28-points-week/,27,"A sneak preview at the coming Republican civil war if things go sideways tonight and the election produces a blowout. According to YouGov’s Will Jordan, Ryan’s net favorable rating within his own party stood at +23 a week or so ago. Then, after the “Access Hollywood” tape was revealed, Ryan told House Republicans that he’ll no longer defend Trump or campaign with him. Trump spent the following week needling Ryan on Twitter and at his rallies for not showing the same support for him as Democratic pols showed for Clinton. That culminated in Trumpers chanting “Paul Ryan sucks” at a rally in Ryan’s home state of Wisconsin a few days ago.

Paul Ryan’s favorable rating today: That’s 40 percent favorable, 45 percent unfavorable among Republicans — five points underwater, a 28-point shift in a week. In a week! His job approval among Republicans is even worse at 36/44. And then there’s this: The Republican Speaker of the House is more widely disliked among the Republican base than he is among the Democratic one. Lest there’s any doubt what’s causing this, here’s what YouGov got when they asked people if Republican leaders were right or wrong to withdraw their support from Trump after the tape was released. Ryan actually hasn’t withdrawn his endorsement of Trump, but his phone call operated as a license to members of his caucus to withdraw their own if they felt it would help them politically. Result: By a five-to-one margin, Republican voters dislike watching the rest of the party run away from Trump even though the point of doing that is to protect Republican congressional majorities as a potential check on Clinton. What Ryan’s experiencing now in his crumbling popularity on the right is a taste of what Ted Cruz experienced at the convention after he declined to endorse Trump in his speech, except Ryan’s acting in the interests of his caucus instead of his own national ambitions. There’s another complicating factor in the reaction too: Republican voters simply aren’t that troubled by the “Access Hollywood” tape that caused Ryan to kinda sorta cut Trump loose. Just 14 percent told YouGov they were bothered “a lot” by it and only 21 percent thought Trump has actually done the things he talks about on it. (Bear in mind, this poll was conducted from October 15-18, days after the sexual assault allegations started dropping.) When asked if it was mere “locker room talk” or something more, Republicans split 62/14.

In fact, check this out: More Republicans said the tape made them more likely to vote for Trump than less likely. Mmmm, that’s some spicy partisanship! But note the independent numbers, particularly the 20 percent who said it made them much less likely to vote for Trump. If you’re looking for reasons to explain why Hillary has improved over the last month or so with indies and now leads them in various polls, there’s one. Similarly, Quinnipiac’s new poll today finds 24 percent of independents calling the tape a “deal breaker” and another 36 percent calling it a “big deal.” A near-majority of 45 percent of indies say they believe the sexual-assault allegations against Trump too (22 percent of Republicans agree). The tape obviously did some real damage and Ryan, recognizing it, encouraged his caucus to try to save themselves and the House majority with it. And now he’s being punished for it.

One more number from YouGov. This result is interesting given the beating Ryan’s taking from Republicans right now. The question asked was, “Who do you think is the leader of the Republican party?” You would expect a majority of Republicans to say Trump when we’re a month out from Election Day. Nope — it’s Ryan, narrowly, which reflects either the deep ideological ambivalence on the right to the nominee or a growing resignation that Trump’s going to lose and Ryan will be the leader of the party the day after. Interestingly, pluralities of Dems and independents also say Ryan, not Trump, is the leader of the party. That’s especially odd among Democrats since you’d think they’d want to spread the idea that the very unpopular Trump is the face of the GOP, not the mildly unpopular Ryan. Maybe that’s the result of Hillary Clinton having spent the last three months telling the country that Trump doesn’t represent mainstream Republicans, a talking point that’s driven other Democrats nuts since it lets Republicans downballot off the hook for Trump’s worst excesses. If the GOP hangs onto the Senate, that’ll partly explain why. "
100738,1006,"Oh my: IBD national poll has Trump ahead by one point, 41/40",http://hotair.com/archives/2016/10/19/oh-ibd-national-poll-trump-ahead-one-point-4140/,27,"One word, my friends: Gamechanger.

Or “outlier.” That’s a word too.

After more than a week of blistering attacks from Democrats, celebrities and the press, Donald Trump has managed to pull ahead of Hillary Clinton by 1 percentage point — 41.3% to 40% — in a four-way matchup, according to the new IBD/TIPP poll released today…

The IBD/TIPP poll previously was monitoring support for the candidates in the 2016 election on a monthly basis. The new results are Trump’s best showing in months. The poll also found that in a two-way matchup, Clinton is up by 3 points — 43.6% to 40.6% — which represents a slight gain from September, when Clinton was ahead 44% to 43%…

By gender, Clinton does much better among women — 47% to 37% — but Trump’s lead among men is just as strong at 47% to 32%.
There are various surprising results here, starting with the fact that Clinton not only leads in the two-way race but her lead has grown since last month — even as Trump has nudged ahead of her in the four-way race. How to explain that? The answer, it seems, lies with the Green Party candidate: IBD has far-left Jill Stein at six percent, her best number in any national poll since the beginning of August. Stein is averaging just 2.6 percent in RCP’s poll average; of the last 13 polls taken, she’s at 1-2 percent in most of them. Six percent is a big number, and significant since almost all of Stein’s support is coming out of Clinton’s share of the vote. She’s turning a three-point Hillary lead in the two-way race into a one-point Trump lead in the four-way. That’s probably an outlier, but if you’re looking for evidence that the Wikileaks revelations about Clinton’s Wall Street speeches are starting to bite among progressives, here you go. If we see a couple more polls showing Stein beginning to rise, Clinton will have something to worry about.

The other eyepopping number here is the gender gap. The story of the last few weeks, capped by the two national polls I blogged earlier, is that Clinton is opening a big lead among women while Trump’s lead among men is either small or nonexistent. (Clinton, not Trump, led among men in the Bloomberg and PRRI polls I noted this morning.) Read this Harry Enten post tabulating the gender numbers in other recent national surveys. Trump leads among men by an average of seven points; Clinton’s lead among women, at 20 points, is nearly triple that, and women tend to vote at higher rates than men do. That’s a recipe for an unholy beating in November. IBD has Trump ahead by a point overall because its own gender numbers cut against that trend: Clinton leads by 10 among women but Trump’s lead among men is larger, a whopping 15 points. That seems hard to believe after weeks of media chatter about the “Access Hollywood” tape and the sexual assault allegations, but IBD has a very good track record as a pollster in presidential races. (FiveThirtyEight grades it at A- in its pollster scorecard.) And IBD’s numbers are in line with perennial Trump-friendly polls like Rasmussen, which has the race tied at 42 today, and the LA Times, which has the candidates separated by two-tenths of a point. These three pollsters comprise one cluster of national polls right now — the “dead-heat” cluster. Everyone else is in the “Trump getting curb-stomped” cluster. One group or the other is going to be deeply humiliated in three weeks.

The most encouraging number for Trump in the IBD survey, I think, has to do with voter enthusiasm. Even if you find the gender numbers hard to believe, the fact that 67 percent of Trump’s supporters “strongly” back him versus 58 percent of Clinton’s who “strongly” back her seems plausible, and jibes with the enthusiasm numbers in today’s Bloomberg poll. Bloomberg found 65 percent of Trump fans saying they’re “very” or “fairly” enthused about him versus 58 percent of Clinton voters who say so about her. If you’re looking for a reason to believe he’ll outperform his polling on Election Day due to spectacular turnout, that’s it. He’d have to outperform it by a lot, though, if the polls are right that Clinton’s now leading by six points or so nationally. And he’d have to do it despite a Democratic ground-game advantage. Hillary might have more soft support than Trump does, but she also has better means to deliver her soft supporters to the polls. A lot of unenthusiastic Clinton backers turning out next month will turn this into a rout.

Incidentally, since we’re talking polls, here’s a nice graph from today’s PRRI release. Note how the numbers for white evangelicals changed in just five years. That’s not altogether a bad thing, as not all personal indiscretions are created equal. Some candidates who have a divorce or two under their belts might nonetheless make fine presidents, and evangelicals appear to be more open to that now. Sexual assault is another matter — and Republicans seem to be more open to that too. So while this trend isn’t entirely bad, it sure ain’t entirely good either. The sheer magnitude of the shift over such a short time also points to opportunism here. It would be one thing if evangelicals had evolved (devolved?) on this subject gradually, while the GOP was busy nominating traditional candidates. Given the sudden sea change in opinion, though, this doesn’t seem to be a matter of thinking hard about how personal morals might impact a hypothetical president’s ethical behavior while in office. It looks like they’re simply writing Trump a blank check on morals to justify voting for him over Clinton this fall. I can’t wait for the next “Values Voter Summit.”

As I write this, a new national poll from Quinnipiac is hitting the wires: Clinton 47, Trump 40, Johnson 7, and Green Party spoiler Jill Stein pulling her usual one percent of the vote once again. Add one more to the “curb-stomp” cluster."

What in the world was wrong with Hillary Clinton?

Did you see those head movements?

Many people were wondering what was going on…

From The Daily Caller: As the two candidates sparred on stage at the University of Nevada, Las Vegas for 90 minutes, the Democratic nominee rocked her head back and forth as Donald Trump answered questions from the moderator Chris Wallace.

Viewers at home quickly noticed Clinton’s strange behavior. Yeah, my thoughts exactly.

Her body language was incredibly strange.  The liberal media pretends it’s impossible she could be wearing a headset.

Hillary invited Mark Cuban.

Donald Trump invited several of the women who accused Bill Clinton of sexual assault as well as Kathy Shelton.

It looks like Trump might invite Obama’s half brother from Kenya to the debate tonight as well.

But apparently, Trump is inviting someone else that might rattle Hillary and Bill.

A woman who came out today and said that Bill Clinton sexually assaulted her.


Matt Vespa has more…

From Townhall: Donald Trump is playing no holds barred as both sides prepare for the final presidential debate. In what appears to be an ongoing campaign of psychological warfare, Katiewrote how Trump invited Obama’s half-brother to the final event, though it looks like he might be a supporter of Hamas. Yet, there’s another curveball. Trump has invited the latest Clinton accuser to the debate who alleges that former President Bill Clinton sexually assaulted her three times in 1980. At the time, accuser Leslie Millwee was working as a local news reporter in Arkansas (via Politico):

Millwee told Breitbart she interviewed Clinton about 20 times publicly and also met with him in KLMN-TV’s newsroom. She said he groped her and rubbed his genitals on her while they were alone in KLMN-TV’s small editing room.”He came in [to the editing room] behind me, started hunching me to the point that he had an orgasm,” she told Breitbart’s Aaron Klein. “He’s touching, trying to touch my breasts and I’m just sitting there very stiffly, just waiting for him to leave me alone. And I’m asking him the whole time, ‘Please do not do this. Do not touch me. Do not hunch me. I do not want this.’ And he finished doing what he was doing and walked out.


She also said Clinton once gave her half of his tie and wrote his name on her reporter’s notebook, and that he once tried to visit her apartment but left after she did not let him enter. She said she was so nervous after the assaults that her grandmother came from Oklahoma to keep her company. After Clinton came to her apartment, she said, her grandmother advised her to quit her job at the TV station.

Some serious mind games going on.

You gotta think that stuff bothers Hillary right?

Or has she completely numbed herself against those criticisms over the years?

That’s pretty clear to the voters by now.

A lot of voters out there seem to not care about honesty and instead focus on the fact Trump has said some rude things.

It’s strange to watch.

Hours before the final presidential debate, Hillary is in hot water for lying yet again.

Will it matter? Sarah Westwood has more…

From Washington Examiner: Responding to a set of questions under oath last week, Clinton said through her lawyer that she did not recall discussing her server with Bryan Pagliano, the IT aide whose immunity deal was the first to emerge publicly from the year-long FBI probe.

“Secretary Clinton states that she does not recall having communications with Bryan Pagliano concerning or relating to the management, preservation, deletion, or destruction of any emails in her clintonemail.com email account,” Clinton testified through her lawyer, David Kendall, after raising objections to the question. But emails provided to conservative-leaning Judicial Watch through the Freedom of Information Act show Clinton included Pagliano in discussions about her Blackberry, iPad and server when her network experienced problems in 2012.

The two email chains, included among 15 pages of documents published by Judicial Watch on Wednesday, show Pagliano wrote directly to Clinton and copied Justin Cooper, a former Clinton Foundation aide who also provided assistance for the email system, in March 2012.

“Let me take a look at the server to see if it offers any insight,” Pagliano wrote in an email to Clinton after she complained to him and Cooper of the “troubles” plaguing her Blackberry.

This woman is simply incapable of telling the truth.

You want four years of this in the White House?"
100742,1008,Are Opponents of Redefining Marriage Natural Opponents of Trump?,http://www.americanthinker.com/articles/2016/10/are_opponents_of_redefining_marriage_natural_opponents_of_trump.html,27,"Casual observers might assume that pro-family and anti-Trump sentiments go together.  Many of the most outspoken defenders of marriage (Robert P. George and Maggie Gallagher come to mind) came out early as uncompromising opponents of Donald J. Trump.  Trump's personal history with marriage alarms people who support the institution, considering that he is on his third wife.  Allegations swirl about ungentlemanly, if not explicitly unchaste, conduct on his part toward the opposite sex.

At the nominating convention in Cleveland, one of Trump's cheerleaders was Peter Thiel.  Thiel got a rousing reception despite being homosexual and despite public remarks that seemed to brush aside social conservatism.  Moreover, one of Trump's most vocal advocates in Cleveland was the flamboyant Milo Yiannopoulos, who delivered a popular speech for Trump at a confab of fellow homosexuals; behind him hung oversized tableaux that looked like underage gay porn.  Trump has not made assertive statements promising to push a legal reversal of Obergefell, nor promised any opposition to the LGBT agenda in his acceptance speech in Cleveland.

In fact, the one reference to LGBT issues by Donald J. Trump's Cleveland speech was his promise to defend the ""LGBTQ community.""  This referred implicitly to the massacre in Orlando, Florida a little more than one month prior.  His use of the politically correct acronym signaled to many that he was both advised by and geared toward the gay lobby.

In an interview with me, Maggie Gallagher explained that she did not take seriously Mr. Trump's promises to defend Christianity beyond saying, ""Merry Christmas.""  She sees Trump's disappointing position on marriage, both in personal and political terms, as a central reason for withholding her vote even if America might then face a Hillary Clinton presidency.

Those in Gallagher's coterie feel little desire to throw their support to Trump, whom many of them find distasteful for the same reasons that leftists condemn him; namely, his coarse language, pugnacious posture, and quasi-nativist populism on trade, jobs, and immigration.

Things have become precarious for people such as Jon Eastman, Mark Bauerlein, Carol Swain, and myself, who have signed on with the scholars and writers in favor of Trump.  Many people within my orbit not only see Trump as unfit for office; they also see scholars who publicly support him as unfit for the public square.  Hence, one of the more memorable recent pieces in Public Discourse came from Nathaniel Peters, who wrote that the 135 scholars were betrayers to the cause who had demoralized and harmed young conservatives by setting a bad example.  Reading Peters's piece, I felt like Socrates accused by the young Meletus of corrupting Athenian youth before a vast jury of eminent elders.

The British and French Precedents

But there's more than meets the eye.  I predicted the rise of someone like Trump not in spite of, but rather because of the fight over gay marriage.  On March 24, 2013, I stood on a platform just below the Champs-Élysées and looked upon a mass of over a million French people who had stormed Paris to oppose marriage and adoption by members of the same sex.  There, in the French capital, I sensed an energy I'd never seen before.  Though they were an orderly assembly, they were not like the Tea Party rallies, at which people distributed copies of the Constitution and talked about the need to limit government spending.  The feelings of the French people were passionate and urgent, dealing not with bureaucratic abstractions, but with the emotional tension of real-life families.

At a café a few blocks from the Eiffel Tower, I met Frigide Barjot, the mischievous and unexpected leader of the groundswell against redefining marriage.  She was no conservative.  Neither was Lionel Lumbroso, the Jewish atheist I have befriended, or Xavier Bongibault, the sassy gay blond who might have been the French precursor to Milo.  Among their followers were people with largely liberal inclinations, sympathetic to workers, suspicious of wealthy globalists, and supportive of labor unions.

The March 24 march on Paris degenerated into clouds of tear gas and culminated in the ouster of Frigide Barjot from her own movement.  Buttoned up French Catholic elites got rid of Barjot, replacing her with more staid and less erratic options.  The result was that Barjot's movement became much less chaotic and smaller.  Barjot could find no help as the gay mayor of Paris had her evicted from her apartment, and the LGBT movement steamrolled to victory after victory in the French Parliament.

I also traveled to the United Kingdom as the redefinition of marriage was pushed through the House of Commons by a supposedly Conservative prime minister.  The queen of England and titular head of the Church of England, Elizabeth II, signed on to gay marriage despite the fact that her own church's official position was against it and rumors abounded that she was personally opposed.

In both France and England, mobs of panicked citizens felt that this change was an ill development that promised to harm people's neighborhoods and families.  The problem was that they were invisible to all but the most astute observers because their own ""conservative"" leaders felt embarrassed by them and were all too happy to assist the press in ignoring their existence.

Even the conservatives who were officially against redefining marriage had no incentive to acknowledge these masses, since those same conservatives were invariably linked to classical liberalism in economic policy, which repelled working-class Christians who wanted government to take an active role in building an economy friendlier to working-class and middle-class Europeans.

Moreover, the conservative ""spokespeople"" had in many cases built their careers on being the only opponents of redefining marriage invited to join the pro-gay left on the stage for public debates.  If they acknowledged millions more everyday citizens who had greater passions and blunter arguments against the attempt to marry same-sex couples, they would lose their claim to be the official oppositional voices and all the benefits that came with that honorary status.  It was inevitable that the Christian rank and file would figure out that the left was picking who the ""dignified opposition"" would be – namely, who could be rewarded for losing gracefully to the gay lobby.

In both France and England, hundreds of thousands of citizens' petitions opposing the redefinition of marriage were thrown out based on technicalities while politicians brazenly lied about a near unanimity for gay rights among their populace.  The standard conservative parties proved infinitely corruptible or craven, while the Labor and Socialist parties in London and Paris were fortresses of impenetrable ideology determined to transform Europe into a homosexual paradise.

The Church of England and the Catholic Church were horrendously disappointing, offering faint lip service now and then but often openly sabotaging efforts by the Christian faithful to stop the redefinition of marriage.  Their sabotage usually came in the form of ""let us be loving and keep from spreading judgment or hate,"" which usually led to Christ's vision of marriage being compromised and sugarcoated until it had little to do with biblical sexuality at all.  Meanwhile, redistributive charity was the last thing on the minds of the pro-gay corporate globalists who were using quotes like ""who am I to judge"" to beat back religious conservatives on LGBT issues.

The perfect storm gathered throughout 2013 and 2014. While we hear a great deal about immigration as the driving issue behind the rise of the Front National in France and the Brexit-UKIP right in the United Kingdom, one must note that angst over immigration had existed for a long time in the two countries.  The marriage debacle was, on the contrary, fresh and new.  The redefinition of marriage was commonly viewed as something imposed by the United States and the European Union.  It galvanized many people who were not necessarily militant about immigration but who saw how elites within government and the churches were abandoning their working- and middle-class constituencies while openly rebelling against God.  It became perfectly reasonable to many churchgoing people, even liberal ones, to get in league with UKIP and the Front National regardless of whether the two parties were true believers in biblical marriage, for the simple reason that at least Nigel Farage and the Le Pens were willing to fight and play by rules other than the ones that the globalized left had rigged.  The masses decided early on that they would rather have a right-wing warrior who might not be perfectly Christian but who would fight to win than a flawless Bible-quoter guaranteed to lose.

Moreover, class loomed as the deciding factor.  Why ally with Christian leaders who championed ""conservative fiscal policy"" when so many Christians (myself included) see our rights as workers threatened?  The far right figures who might not be entirely biblical in their reasoning tended, ironically, to be more in tune with the struggles of working Christians.  Their heightened sympathy for the worker was one reason they had daring but popular stances on immigration, pushing for a stop to cheap labor flowing into their countries and depressing wages for citizens.

Washington, D.C.

After Obergefell was decided, I saw that the conservative movement had little incentive to continue protecting those of us who had spoken out for marriage.  Lackluster orators had hogged all the airtime during the lead-up to the marriage debate and now claimed they were the only ones brave enough to stand for marriage during the dark hours when biblical chastity was doomed.  In truth, they doomed biblical marriage by making terrible decisions about how to fight for it and by yoking social conservatism to Bush-era fiscal policy.  Sarah Palin was right about crony capitalism; it turns off the vast majority of poor and middle-class Christians who hold conservative views on sexuality.

I found myself on the road to Damascus by the end of 2015.  When California State University Northridge moved to sanction me based on charges that I had discriminated against gays by organizing a pro-family conference at the Ronald Reagan Presidential Library, I was on my own.  The Reagan Library did not come forward to defend me.  A Republican congressman who had received letters from constituents begging him to intervene in my case sent one letter to Chancellor Timothy White and washed his hands of the case.

It was clear that I was no better than the average French or British citizen rallying to Brexit or the Le Pens.  I was no better than the average American getting egged or called racist at Trump rallies.  I was a fool who'd been taken advantage of.  I wanted the whole system to be broken down.  I wanted a wrecking ball candidate to come to D.C. and start over.

I have no naïve expectations of Donald J. Trump.  I doubt he agrees with me on all things that I have fought for.  But he holds an irreplaceable value: he fights where others are happy to lose comfortably.  I need someone who actually wants to win and who isn't going to play these deceptive games with causes for which humble supporters are staking their families' livelihoods.  If he is crass, so be it.  So am I.  It is easy to side with the NeverTrumps and feel smugly superior to everyone else.  The problem is, when you do so, you are on the wrong side of history.

100743,1008,The Victims Speak: This Is What Hillary Did,http://www.americanthinker.com/articles/2016/10/the_victims_speak_heres_what_hillary_did.html,27,"There they go again.  People are horrified about the accusations women are making against Donald Trump.  Yet, looking at what Hillary Clinton has said and done professionally and personally over the years, she is an enabler, an accomplice, and a bully.

What Mr. Trump should do is pivot away, talk about issues of concern, and allow others to talk about the issue of women.   But it is understandable how he can be frustrated with those who claim they will not vote for him because they are taking the moral high ground.  American Thinker interviewed Juanita Broaddrick and Kathy Shelton's spokesperson, Candice Jackson, regarding their opinions about the Clintons' disregard for women.

Juanita recounted how Bill Clinton in 1978 invited her to discuss her concerns about the nursing home industry any time she came to Little Rock.  Three weeks later, she was there for a meeting.  She and Clinton were to meet at a coffee shop, but at the last minute, he changed it to her hotel room because of the noise.  While making chitchat, he pointed down to an old building, putting his hand over her shoulder.  He then turned her around and forced her on to the bed, violently raped her, and bit her top lip to stop her from yelling for help.

Hillary Clinton was quoted in 2015 as saying, ""To every survivor of sexual assault…you have the right to be heard.  You have the right to be believed.  We're with you.""  Too bad she did not feel that way in 1975 when defending a rapist who assaulted twelve-year-old Kathy Shelton.  Typical of defense attorneys, she put the blame on Kathy, with various interrogations and accusations of being a liar.  Clinton smeared and humiliated this rape victim, who was beaten so savagely that she nearly died.  Why would Clinton go with this defense strategy if she were a true advocate of women and children?  Jackson's answer: ""She unethically and immorally blamed a twelve-year-old victim.""

It is understandable that anyone accused of rape deserves a defense attorney.  But if Hillary Clinton is such an advocate of women's rights, how could she become a defense attorney where she would be in a position of defending rapists of children?  Beyond that, she showed no empathy by laughing on an audiotape about the incident and getting her client off, and she never said she was sorry. 

Candice, author of Their Lives: The Women Targeted by the Clinton Machine, considered the top two defenses for Hillary surrounding Kathy: ""excusing the laughter as nervous, and she was only defending her client.  But people should listen to the whole audio, because it was not just one nervous chuckle.  After the trial, you would think she would have described this case as tragic, heartbreaking, horrible, and being sad for having to defend this guy.  Instead, you hear the smugness, pride in the result, and how she managed to twist the system to make herself appear like a good lawyer.  I don't see the humanity in that.  There is absence of any expression of remorse, horror, human decency, and sympathy of what this case is about.""

Why did the feminist organizations and Gloria Allred not stand beside Juanita and Kathy?  Jackson told American Thinker, ""It does not matter who the victim is on the other side, because they refuse to abandon their political allies like the Clintons.  It does not matter, the trail of victims Hillary Clinton left in her wake.  They look the other way because of an obvious political agenda.  Her entire life has been a construction of picking issues she thinks will get her ahead politically instead of genuine passion for these causes.""

Now her vice presidential pick, Senator Kaine, calls her a victim.  Really?

This is after she defamed Bill Clinton's accusers of sexual assault, laughed at getting a rapist off, and had her surrogate Gloria Steinem say the only reason female Millennials were voting for Bernie Sanders was because they needed a date.  Then Michelle Obama in an ad stated, ""We cannot allow the shocking, hurtful, hateful rhetoric about women[.] … [L]et's elect Hillary Clinton and other Democrats who share our values and can be role models for our children.""  No parent should ever want the Clintons to be role models. 

The hypocrisy by these politicians and mainstream media, including Megyn Kelly, is unbelievable.  Juanita is frustrated that the media are effectively becoming surrogates for the Clintons, ignoring what Bill Clinton has done to her.  ""They call it infidelities, but they are actually crimes.  When Megyn Kelly called what I said lies and referred to my false affidavit, she did not understand where I was coming from.  It was something I could not discuss because it was too demeaning, especially since I kept quiet.  I blamed myself for allowing him to come to my room.  I felt so ashamed.

""Since Bill Clinton was attorney general, he was the police.  I was very frightened in how this man was connected to law enforcement.  I was also angry since for twenty years, I had finally moved on.  Then, all of a sudden, in the 1990s, two investigators show up at my front door, Beverly and Rick Lambert, Miranda's parents.  They recorded me without my knowledge, saying in so many words, 'That incident was a painful time in my life and there is no way I am going to come out for some lawsuit.'  I think at some point they did come out recalling what I had said.""  Furthermore, she says she wanted to just hide from the truth, but after Ken Starr sent a deposition request, her son, an attorney, said she had to speak the truth, which she did. 

There are those who argue that Bill Clinton is not running for president and that Hillary should not be blamed for what her husband has done.  But Juanita does not see it that way.  ""Hillary said she was going to put her husband in charge of the economy.  He should not be in charge of anything in the White House.  He will be given tremendous responsibility, and that is just not right.  She constantly tried to cover up for him.  She was so complicit, in charge of what she called 'the bimbo eruption.'  She tried to silence so many of us through threats and intimidations.  Look what Wikileaks just released about Hillary Clinton's campaign trying to figure out how to control what I was saying.  She is not an advocate for all women, but is only an advocate for one woman: herself.  Even her daughter Chelsea, after the debate, called what happened 'her father's trivial sexual misdeeds.'  I feel that her saying that is an injustice to the women he committed crimes against, and she is old enough to know that.""

Juanita wants Americans to understand: ""in the 1970s, rape victims did not have the same rights, and there were not nearly as many support groups and advocates.  The Clintons are evil, corrupt, and protected by the media.  I feel that in the Spin Room during the debate, I had an opportunity to discuss what I went through and the pain it caused.  People should not give the Clintons a free pass if they care about women's issues.  I do not think the media is giving adequate attention to what the Clintons did.""

Even though Obamacare premiums are exploding, U.S. enemies are emboldened, jobs are lessening at a high rate – if the woman's issue is the go-to voting subject, then don't vote.  Otherwise, you are considered a hypocrite, and you allow the double standard to exist in this country.  Hillary Clinton tries to display herself as the poster child for women's rights, but these incidents prove she is not a champion of female rape victims.  She is ruthless, ambitious, and calculating, with a willingness to break the rules.

100744,1008,What if There Were a National Conservative Party?,http://www.americanthinker.com/articles/2016/10/what_if_there_were_a_national_conservative_party.html,27,"The Battleground Poll published a few weeks before the 2016 presidential election has grim news for Donald Trump, who is predicted to get only around 40% of the popular vote, while Hillary gets about 47% despite having unfavorables almost as high as Trump's.  The news for Republicans generally is not much better.  The Republican generic congressional ballot runs six points behind Democrats, the weakest showing in a decade.

While the Republican brand and its presidential nominee receive very low marks from voters in this Battleground Poll, there remains a bright spot for those with principled opposition to hyper-federalism, secular humanism, and encroaching socialism.  The ""conservative"" label continues to be, as it has since the question was first asked in public opinion polling in the early 1960s, a clear majority of Americans – larger than all the other ideological groups combined – and self-identified ""conservatives"" continue to strongly outnumber self-identified ""liberals.""

The electoral implications are immense.  If self-identified conservatives in the Battleground Poll voted for Trump and self-identified liberals voted for Clinton, Trump would win by a landslide.  The results are the same in this year's Gallup poll if self-identified moderates broke evenly between liberal and conservative candidates.  Gallup also shows that conservatives outnumber liberals in almost every one of the fifty states.

So why are conservatives likely to lose this election?  The Republican Party label is inextricably connected with the corrupt Washington Establishment.  At the same time, significant numbers of conservatives are not convinced that Trump, the Republican nominee who rails against that Republican Establishment, is truly conservative.  (Indeed, Trump avoids even running as a conservative, per se, and has suggested that he is a candidate who will transcend ideology.)

Both Battleground Poll and Gallup surveys this year show that if voters were presented with clear ideological alternatives between conservative and liberal labels, the conservative candidate would get about 57% of the popular vote.  Other polling organizations like Survey USA show exactly the same pattern.  None of these organizations tilts toward conservatism; Gallup, in fact, does the best it can to hide what its own data show.

Does anyone seriously doubt that the Republican Party, which unlike the Democrat Party is supposed to actually stand for certain principles and values, is grievously and probably terminally broken?  Does anyone believe that if Donald Trump loses in November (we all ought to seriously hope he wins, but the prospects look dimmer every day), the Republican Party will have any sort of leadership left? 

So why not build a new national party that rejects the Republican label, seeks grassroots leadership, and is firmly committed to conservative values, the values of the clear majority of Americans?  Indeed, ""conservative"" is the most resiliently popular term in American political life, and it has been for well over half a century.  Such a party would be a clean break with the discredited ""Republican"" label and a strong bond with the trusted ""conservative"" label.

Moreover, the formation out of the debris of the Republican Party of a new National Conservative Party would be the perfect chance to begin with a primary expression of beliefs and values and of guiding principles and specific positions on issues.  At a time when Americans are truly desperate for something other than the two major establishment political parties, the keenest ear will be given to those who first come up with a real change from politics as usual.  Surely part of the appeal of the third- and fourth-party candidates this year is the nausea many voters feel at having to choose between a Democrat and a Republican this election cycle.  Both choices are rightly seen as a continuation of politics as usual.

What is the downside of forming a National Conservative Party?  It is hard to see any downside at all if all conservatives who are now Republicans or independent or Democrat are invited to join this new party, and if state election laws are changed to require runoffs to win elections so that no candidate will be elected with less than 50% of the vote.  This would eliminate the prospect of liberal candidates splitting conservative votes.

Many millions of Americans feel that our nation is close to a tipping point and that only dramatic change can save our nation.  Forming, regardless of how this election turns out, a National Conservative Party is precisely the sort of dramatic change that Americans have been waiting to see.

100745,1009,"PATRICK KENNEDY, HILLARY CLINTON’S FIXER",http://www.powerlineblog.com/archives/2016/10/patrick-kennedy-hillary-clintons-fixer.php,27,"Patrick Kennedy, the State Department official who tried to get the FBI to change email classifications in exchange for helping the FBI meet its staffing needs in Bagdhad, is what they used to call a “fixer.” A fixer is not quite the same thing as a henchman. Cheryl Mills played that role at the Clinton State Department.

Kennedy has been a fixer in both Democratic and Republican administrations. But until Hilary Clinton came to Foggy Bottom, there’s no evidence that Kennedy needed to fix things corruptly.

The Clintons corrupt everything they touch, so it’s not surprising that as Hillary’s State Department fixer, Kennedy went to corrupt lengths. In the case of the FBI negotiations, the Bureau either needed extra personnel in Baghdad or it didn’t. If it didn’t, Kennedy should not have offered to help the FBI. If it did, he should have helped the FBI unconditionally. [Note: Though Kennedy disputes tying FBI manpower to classification of documents, the chief of the FBI’s records management division says the deal was presented to him, via his colleague who spoke to Kennedy, as a “quid pro quo”].

Baghdad is not some way station; it is at the center of American foreign policy and national security concerns. For Kennedy to condition his assistance in obtaining extra U.S. personnel in that hot-spot on a favor for a presidential candidate is deplorable. And, as argued below, it’s clear that he did this in concert with Hillary Clinton.

The FBI negotiation is just one example of Kennedy trying to fix things for Clinton. Steve Hayes reminds us of another.

It was Kennedy who helped Cheryl Mills select Clinton-friendly members and staff for the State Department’s Administrative Review Board (ARB). Clinton would later use the findings of the ARB as the key component of her defense on Benghazi. However, as Hayes says, the in-house State Department investigation of those attacks was hardly independent:

The chairmen acknowledged under congressional questioning that they had advised Clinton and her team about potentially problematic witnesses before congressional hearings, provided an advanced copy of their final report to several top Clinton staffers, allowed [Cheryl] Mills to edit the report, and even briefed Clinton for two hours on their findings before they were made public.

In this instance, Kennedy wasn’t just fixing things for Hillary, he was fixing them for himself. Kennedy was at fault for the poor security at Benghazi. Gregory Hicks, the State Department’s charge d’affaires in Libya, testified before Congress that “given the decision-making that Under Secretary Pat Kennedy was making with respect to Embassy Tripoli and Consulate Benghazi operations, he has to bear some responsibility” for the Benghazi terror attack.

As Clinton’s fixer, it was only natural that Kennedy assist the Clinton Foundation. The Washington Examiner reports that Kennedy was involved in pushing plans for a new $177.9 million embassy in Norway in 2011 over the apparent objections of diplomatic officials in Oslo. Norway’s government has donated between $10 million and $25 million to the Clinton Foundation, donor records show.

“Yes” to $177.9 million for an diplomatic officials didn’t want; “no” (absent help for the Clinton campaign) to two agents in Baghdad the FBI wanted badly. And “no” to beefed up security in Benghazi.

Kennedy also helped fix it so that Brian Pagliano, the man in charge of Hillary’s home-brew email server, got a job at the State Department. A State Department official told the FBI:

Around the time of Clinton’s onboard transition, Patrick Kennedy, Undersecretary of State for Management, suggested [redacted] interview Brian Pagliano, who served on Clinton’s. . .presidential campaign. [Redacted] and [Redacted] interviewed Pagliano, who had an MBA form the University of Maryland. After interviewing Pagliano [Redacted] agreed he would be a good fit for [Redacted] team. Pagliano was subsequently hired on to DoS in a Schedule C position, and was tasked with assisting mainly with cost recovery planning and researching DoS technical enhancement opportunities.

(Emphasis added)

Kennedy claims he had no knowledge that Clinton was using a private email server. However, he exchanged dozens of emails with Secretary Clinton’s private email address. In fact, he emailed Clinton at two private addresses: HDR22@clintonemail.com and hr15@att.blackberry.net.

Kennedy’s official job at the State Department isn’t fixer, it is Undersecretary of State for Management. As such, he oversees the department’s compliance with federal records laws. Clinton’s use of a private email server undermined the department’s ability to comply with federal records laws. Kennedy knew from his own correspondence with Clinton that she was using private email for State Department business.

All of this is clear. The remaining question is whether Kennedy sought to have the FBI help Clinton’s position in the email scandal on his own or, instead, at the behest of Clinton.

It seems unlikely that Kennedy would do this something this risky — the FBI could have gone public immediately with Kennedy’s quid pro quo offer — without sign off from the party he was serving. However, we need not speculate. The timing of events demonstrates Clinton’s involvement in Kennedy’s efforts.

As John pointed out, quoting FBI memos, prior to the end of the conversation between Kennedy and the key FBI man on the classification issue, “KENNEDY asked whether the FBI or STATE would conduct the public statements on the matter.” The FBI man “advised KENNEDY that the FBI would not comment publicly on the matter.”

Safe in the knowledge (dutifully provided by Kennedy) that the FBI would not be commenting, Hillary Clinton promptly met the press, a rare event, “to deny having sent classified emails on her private email server.”

Thus, when Kennedy tried to influence the FBI, via a quid pro quo, to help the Clinton campaign, he was no rogue fixer. He was a fixer working closely with Hillary Clinton, as he had in the past.

As President, Bill Clinton needed not just an ordinary fixer but a “Secretary of Sh*t” (John Podesta filled that job for a time). As President, Hillary Clinton will need at least one. Patrick Kennedy is perfect for the role."
100746,1009,"TRUMP DEBATES WELL, BUT IS UNLIKELY TO MOVE THE NEEDLE",http://www.powerlineblog.com/archives/2016/10/160064.php,27,"I’m not sure what it means to “accept” the results of an election, but after tonight’s debate I’m more convinced than ever that this election is unacceptable.

In this corner, wearing the nauseating grin, is Hillary Clinton. She delivered a lengthy oration about the Supreme Court without ever mentioning the Constitution (which Chris Wallace specifically asked her about). Instead, she said she wants the Supreme Court to take sides.

To me, this answer is more inconsistent with Americanism than Trump leaving open the possibility of not “accepting” the results of the election (about which more in a moment).

In the other corner, looking pissed off and menacing, is Donald Trump. Apparently, he does not favor defeating ISIS in Mosul. In addition, as far as I can tell, he wants to concede Syria to Assad, and by extension to Iran, Hezbollah, and Russia.

And speaking of Russia, Trump seems agnostic about Putin, and that’s giving Trump the benefit of the doubt. I haven’t heard the tycoon utter a negative word about the Russian thug and the threat he poses to the world during the entire campaign.

Before assessing the debate, let me say something about “accepting” the results of an election. If, when Trump says he’ll consider his options after the votes are in, he is thinking about perhaps declaring himself president or trying to stage a coup, then Hillary Clinton is right to be horrified. We all should be.

If Trump means he might not formally concede, then he’s contemplating being a very bad loser. To not concede would run counter to a salutary custom, but there is no requirement that losing candidates concede. Not conceding would cast Trump in a bad light, but would hardly threaten the Republic.

If by possibly not accepting the election Trump means he might vigorously argue that it was “rigged” against him — e.g., the media was horribly biased and large numbers of illegal immigrants voted — this would be nothing more than Trump expressing his opinions. The only issue then should be whether Trump’s opinions are valid. If Trump is correct that he was the victim of unprecedented media bias and or voter fraud, then he would be doing America a favor by pointing these things out.

The mainstream media and other Clinton supporters are trying to insulate themselves from criticism over bias and fraud by demonizing Trump. But Trump should not be demonized if all he’s contemplating is arguing that the election wasn’t fair — i.e., refusing to accept that the election he lost was a fair one — as long as he can provide evidence to back his argument up.

As for the debate, there were fewer fireworks than I had expected. For the most part, the candidates debated the issues in an almost civilized manner.

I thought Trump started unevenly and missed some good opportunities to hammer Clinton, but picked up steam as the debate progressed and may have won on points. But I think the public might well adjudge Clinton the winner by about the same margin as her lead in the polls.

In other words, I doubt that the debate changed many minds.

Trump needed to show that he’s decent and stable. He came off that way during most of the debate, but he won’t be judged by this debate alone. And Clinton did an effective job of reminding voters of the long list of Trump transgressions that suggest a lack of decency and stability.

Moreover, Trump’s unwillingness to commit to “accepting” the results of the election may undo whatever progress he made tonight in persuading voters that he’s decent, stable, and presidential. Of all the statements made tonight, Trump’s unwillingness in this regard (whatever it actually means) will probably be the main talking point from the debate. Certainly, it will be what the media talks about the most.

Trump shot himself in the foot with his answer here. In my view, he needed a near flawless performance tonight, and didn’t come close to delivering one.

NOTE: In the original version of this post, I criticized Chris Wallace for not saying what he meant by “accepting” the result of the election. Looking at the transcript, I see that Wallace spoke in terms of Trump “conceding.” Thus, I was wrong to criticize Wallace who, for the most part, did a good job tonight."
100747,1009,HILLARY CLINTON IS A NOBODY,http://www.powerlineblog.com/archives/2016/10/hillary-clinton-is-a-nobody.php,27,"As we steel ourselves for the final presidential debate, it is worth remembering that Hillary Clinton has no talents that would have brought her to public attention, had she not married Bill Clinton. For the first time ever, “service” as First Lady is offered as a qualification for the presidency. Hillary carpet-bagged a Senate seat, running in New York while she was the First Lady, living in the White House. She thereby took unfair advantage of a privileged position that she held only by virtue of her marriage.

Her tenure in the Senate was so undistinguished that, I have read, she doesn’t even mention it in her autobiography. I can’t say for sure since, like virtually all other Americans, I have had better things to do than read Hillary’s book.

Next it was on to the State Department. Here, Hillary’s performance was abysmal. She accomplished nothing in four years, and was sometimes embarrassed, as by the misbegotten (and misspelled) Russian “reset.” Documents released pursuant to various Freedom of Information Act requests demonstrate beyond debate that Hillary and her sycophantic circle intended the overthrow of Moammar Qaddafi in Libya to be the crown jewel of her diplomatic career and the basis of her inevitable presidential run.

Only Hillary committed an appalling blunder: she led the overthrow of a government without having a plan for what would come next. What came next was predictable to anyone with any sense–chaos, and a vacuum that was quickly filled by Islamic terrorists, particularly ISIS. The fiasco of Benghazi, and her lies about that fiasco, were the bitter fruits of the broader disaster of her Libya policy.

Now she is running for president–sort of. She makes as few campaign appearances as possible, and wherever she goes she is greeted by small, unenthusiastic crowds. Most people would as soon get a root canal as listen to one of her speeches. As she nears the finish line, she is being propped up: figuratively by the press, which is determined to drag her across the finish line, and literally by her aides when she falls down, or appears about to.

All of that is a preamble to an email exchange that was made public yesterday by Wikileaks. It is an email thread between Hillary’s campaign manager, John Podesta, and Neera Tanden, supposedly a close friend of Hillary and the head of the Center for American Progress, a left-wing think tank that is a branch of the Democratic Party. The date is September 15, 2015. What prompts the emails is Hillary’s exclamation to an audience in Ohio, “You know, I get accused of being kind of moderate and center, I plead guilty.”

First, here are the emails as disclosed by Wikileaks. Click to enlarge: Neera Tanden begins:

Why did she call herself a moderate?

This was, of course, during the windup to the 2016 primary season, when Hillary’s main competition came from the far left. The response from Podesta–her campaign manager!–is stunning:

I pushed her on this on Sunday night. She claims she didn’t remember saying it. Not sure I believe her. We were speculating, that it may be a Don Baer intervention.

This is remarkable on two levels. First, Hillary described herself as a moderate–seemingly a significant point–and then claimed she didn’t remember doing so. That raises questions about her mental acuity. But Podesta says he isn’t sure he believes her, which means that her own campaign manager thinks she is a liar. Don Baer, if you wondered, is a former communications director and speechwriter for Bill Clinton, who apparently was suspected by the Left of having moderate tendencies.

Neera Tanden wraps up the dialogue:

I mean it makes my life more difficult after telling every reporter I know she’s actually progressive but that is really the smallest of issues. It worries me more that she doesn’t seem to know what planet we are all living in at the moment.

“She doesn’t seem to know what planet we are all living in at the moment.” Tanden, a Democratic Party operative, refers to Hillary Clinton with casual contempt–when talking to Hillary’s campaign manager, who, she obviously thinks, shares that contempt.

It appears that Hillary Clinton, in the eyes of her closest associates, is a pathetic figure, neither truthful nor competent. Today we could add, not only is she neither truthful nor competent, she may not be capable of standing at a podium without help.

It is remarkable that a woman with few if any accomplishments, who is viewed with casual contempt by those who know her best, is apparently on the brink of being elected president."
100748,1010,Trump’s campaign manager touts his ‘five point plan to defeat Islam’,https://thinkprogress.org/conway-trump-defeat-islam-36e37c212358#.9qrhpi2sy,27,"On Wednesday morning, Donald Trump campaign manager Kellyanne Conway touted her candidate’s plan to “defeat” a major world religion with 1.6 billion followers.
Conway made the comments on MSNBC, as part of a point to complain about how the media covers Trump.
“He’ll talk for 45 minutes, and nobody can tell you what the theme was, because nobody wants to cover the theme. They cover one tweet, or they cover one comment,” she said. “He’s giving plans. He gave a… five point plan to defeat Islam.”
 Conway may have been trying to say “radical Islam,” but the comments are still frightening coming from the head of a campaign that has repeatedly demonized Islam and Muslims.
Trump has made banning Muslims from the county a central focus of his campaign_—_which at one point included U.S. citizens living abroad. He has also called for killing Muslims with bullets dipped in pig blood to combat terrorism, registering all Muslims in a federal database, and putting all mosques in the country under surveillance. He has repeatedly said that Muslims know of attacks before they happen and are failing to report them, thus allowing them to take place. During a Republican debate in March, he said that “Islam hates us,” and after being asked whether he meant the world’s entire Muslim population, he said, “I mean a lot of them.”
Conway’s comments also point to the dangers of blaming attacks committed by Muslims on “radical Islam.” As ThinkProgress’ Jack Jenkins has noted, referring to radical Islam to explain such attacks does nothing to help stop them from taking place:
This argument has been dismissed by security experts for some time, many of whom say that such terms only make fighting terrorism harder. Or, as Michael German, a fellow at the Brennan Center for Justice and a former undercover FBI agent, said when asked about the term during a congressional hearing in June, that kind of language “puts us on a path to perpetual war.”
“[Such language] only serves to stoke public fear, xenophobia and anti-Muslim bigotry,” he said.
This election has seen an unprecedented spike in Islamophobic attacks, and experts on hate groups have specifically pointed to Trump’s candidacy as a reason for increased recruitment. ThinkProgress has found at least 110 Islamophobic incidents_—_including harassment, vandalism, and violent attacks_—_since last November. Earlier this year, there was a report of a woman in Washington, D.C. who mentioned her support for Trump before verbally and physically assaulting a Muslim woman.
UPDATE: Conway has clarified in an email to The Daily Beast that she meant to say Trump has a “5-point plan to defeat radical Islamic terrorism” and blamed the error on “sleep deprivation.” The slip of the tongue still highlights the dangers of saying “radical Islamic terrorism,” namely that one begins to associate Islam in general, and Muslims, with terrorism."
100749,1010,Trump adviser likens new rule protecting retirees to discrimination against slaves,https://thinkprogress.org/trump-fiduciary-duty-dred-scott-769442c5819#.4dxxcunsn,27,"Until recently, financial advisers who helped clients decide where to invest their retirement money were legally able to steer them toward products that made themselves money at their clients’ expense. That should soon change, thanks to a new rule from the Department of Labor finalized in April that will require these brokers to adhere to a fiduciary standard and to always put clients’ interests ahead of their own.
But an economic adviser to Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump is already promising to roll that rule back.
Anthony Scaramucci, who is also founder of financial firm SkyBridge Capital, told Mark Schoeff Jr. of InvestmentNews, “We’re going to repeal it,” adding, “It could be the dumbest decision to come out of the U.S. government in the last 50 to 60 years.”
Scaramucci went even further, likening the new rule to an infamous 1857 Supreme Court decision that denied citizenship to all slaves and their descendants. “It’s about like the Dred Scott decision,” he said.
In a follow up email, he explained that he thinks the analogy is fitting. “The left-leaning Department of Labor has made a decision to discriminate against a class of people who they deem to be adding no value,” he said, referring to retirement brokers. “They are judging what should happen in a free market and attempting to put financial advisers out of work.”
The Supreme Court ruling found that Dred Scott, a black slave, had no standing to sue for his freedom because he was not a citizen. It also held that all people of African ancestry, both enslaved and free and even those born in the United States, could never become citizens. It was explicitly repudiated with the addition of the Fourteenth Amendment to the U.S. Constitution, which guarantees birthright citizenship.
The rule change that Scaramucci likens to this case is meant to address a crisis facing many retirees. There has been a huge shift away from guaranteed pension payments to the use of 401(k) retirement plans that require individual employees to make smart investment decisions. Without the new fiduciary duty rule, many of them were being steered into products that made their advisers money but weren’t the best choice, costing them an estimated $17 billion a year.
Today’s retirees can little afford that kind of cost. About a third of working age people have less than $1,000 saved up for their golden years, while more than half have nothing at all.
Republicans have been staunchly opposed to the new rule, however. Shortly after it was finalized, House Republicans voted to block it, claiming the rule will make retirement advice less affordable and calling it government overreach. That position lines up directly with the financial industry, which sent a letter urging lawmakers to vote yes on the resolution.
Trump has claimed that Democratic rival Hillary Clinton is “owned” by Wall Street. Yet repealing the fiduciary duty rule is not the only way that he would give the industry what it wants. Trump has promised to dismantle the Dodd-Frank financial reform legislation meant to rein banks in and said he will ban all new banking regulations."
100750,1010,"As Trump embraces WikiLeaks, Rubio recoils",https://thinkprogress.org/trump-wikileaks-pence-rubio-583e87edf01a#.f4wh11n3j,27,"Donald Trump has been talking a lot about WikiLeaks on the campaign trail, while accusing the mainstream media of not talking about it enough.
During a rally on Tuesday, Trump said, “WikiLeaks has provided things that are unbelievable.” He went on to blame the media for not doing devoting more coverage to the hacked emails from Hillary Clinton campaign chair John Podesta that are being incrementally released by WikiLeaks_—_emails that sometimes illustrate cozy relationships between both reporters and the campaign and the Obama administration and Clinton officials.
“The media, you have to remember, is an extension of the Hillary Clinton campaign,” Trump added. “It’s an extension. And without that she would be nowhere.”
Trump has also downplayed the possibility that Russia is involved in the hacks, saying during the second presidential debate that “maybe there is no hacking.”
“They always blame Russia,” Trump added. “And the reason they blame Russia because they think they’re trying to tarnish me with Russia. I know nothing about Russia.”
But other Republicans are more skeptical about using the emails for their political benefit.
In the wake of the Obama administration announcing earlier this month that it has concluded Russia is involved in hacking emails from Podesta and the Democratic National Committee, Sen. Marco Rubio (R-FL) said he won’t talk about WikiLeaks. Gov. Mike Pence (R-IN), Trump’s running mate, also takes Russia’s possible role in the hacks seriously. During an appearance on Meet the Press last Sunday, Pence said, “I think there’s more and more evidence that implicates Russia, and there should be serious consequences if Russia is violating the privacy and security of the American people.”
Pence then dodged a question on why Trump is more dismissive of Russia’s role. Trump was reportedly briefed about Russia’s role in the WikiLeaks hacks. On July 27, he encouraged Russia to hack Clinton’s emails.
“Russia, if you’re listening, I hope you’re able to find the 30,000 e-mails that are missing,” Trump said. “I think you will probably be rewarded mightily by our press. Let’s see if that happens. That’ll be next.”
Meanwhile, the Ecuadorian government announced Tuesday it has cut off WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange’s internet access from its London embassy because of WikiLeaks’ efforts to impact foreign elections. On Wednesday, Czech officials announced they have arrested a Russian citizen suspected of hacking target in the United States in Prague. A statement released by Czech authorities says the FBI was involved, and the suspect might be extradited to the United States."

In an relaxed, upbeat, and funny speech, Obama rallied an exuberant audience of Florida voters.

He told the audience ""we got to do it big, we got to leave no doubt,"" because ""the Donald is already whining that the vote's going to be rigged before the game is even over."" And he joked that ""this is just about him worried that he's losing."" But then he gets serious, very serious.

This is more than just the usual standard lie. Because when you suggest rigging or fraud without a shred of evidence, when last night at the debate, Trump becomes the first major party nominee in American history to suggest that he will not concede despite losing the vote and then says today that he will accept the vote if he wins, that is not a joking manner. 
I want everyone to pay attention here. That is dangerous. Because when you try to sow the seeds of doubt in people's minds about the legitimacy of our election, that undermines our democracy. Then you're doing the work of our adversaries for them. Because our democracy depends on people knowing that their vote matters. That those who occupy the seats of power were chosen by the people. Even when your preferred candidate loses, even when you are the one who is running and you lose, you've got to see the bigger picture and say that here in America, we believe in democracy and we accept the will of the people.
You can watch below. After last night's soul-crushing display from Trump, and his astounding display today, Obama's speech was a perfect antidote. But it had a critical message. What Donald Trump is doing is dangerous, and he has to be defeated so soundly it'll make his head spin.

Patrick Murphy's latest ad starts with footage of Trump's rankest comments about being able to do ""anything"" to women and grab them by the ""p***y,"" then cuts to a Rubio rally.

""We have to make sure that Donald wins this election,"" Rubio emphatically tells the crowd.

This ad caps a very good week for Murphy, who remains the underdog in the race. He finished off a clean sweep of the state's big four editorial endorsements with one from Rubio's hometown newspaper, the Miami Herald. Plus, a second poll this month put Murphy running behind Rubio by just two points. That's spitting distance. Overall, Rubio still leads by an average of nearly five points, but the gap could narrow as Hillary Clinton's hold on the state solidifies.

Finally, Trump's unwillingness to accept the outcome of this election was like a bomb going off last night in each one of these down-ballot races. Murphy's ad is poised to amplify Trump's self-destruction. 

Can you pitch in $3 to send Marco Rubio packing and turn the Senate blue?

On the few occasions when he was forced to say something not part of his standard talking points, he blabbered in a way that struck a lot of people like a sixth grader forced to stand before the class and give a capsule review of a book that didn’t come out of the backpack all summer.

For example, here’s Trump discussing the D.C. v. Heller case—and keep in mind that Trump has already been given the name of the case, knows that Hillary didn’t like the outcome, that the subject was the Second Amendment, and that Scalia’s was involved.

Well the D.C. versus Heller decision was very strongly, and she was extremely angry about it, I watched, and she was very, very angry when upheld, and Justice Scalia was so involved, and it was a well-crafted decision, but Hillary was extremely upset, extremely angry, and people that believe in the Second Amendment, and believe in it very strongly, were very upset with what she had to say.

Uh-huh. Answers like that inspired tweets like this from St. Louis Alderman and mayoral candidate Antonio French. Which in turn produced an continuing flurry of #TrumpBookReport tweets that are sure to replace Cliff Notes as the go-to summary for those needing a bit of instant literary cred.

100754,1002,WikiLeaks: Hillary’s Conflicted Comments on Fracking,http://www.breitbart.com/2016-presidential-race/2016/10/20/wikileaks-hillarys-conflicted-comments-fracking/,28,"One of the recent WikiLeaks email dumps revealed some interesting things about hydraulic fracturing, also known as fracking.
They add to Hillary Clinton’s conflicted public comments and private positions.

Regarding fracking, the leaked emails offer a glimpse into speeches she made to closed groups. One such speech was given to Deutsche Bank on April 24, 2013. There, she praised fracking as a tool to “make even more countries more energy self-sufficient.” She told the audience: “I’ve promoted fracking in other places around the world.”

Yet, everything she’s said in the campaign, paints a different picture.

Her policies are decidedly anti-fossil fuel. The party platform calls for “a goal of producing 100 percent of electricity from renewable sources by 2050.” In addition to promoting “enough clean renewable energy to power every home in America within ten years,” Hillary’s website outlines her desire to “reduce the amount of oil consumed in the United States and around the world.” She’s declared that banning fossil fuel extraction on public lands is: “a done deal.” While she won’t come out and clearly state that she’d ban fracking, at a March 6 CNN debate with Bernie Sanders in Flint, Michigan, she proudly stated: “By the time we get through all of my conditions, I do not think there will be many places in America where fracking will continue to take place.” And, she has pledged to “stop fossil fuels.”

Then there’s her comment about green-group funding, as coming from Russia. It’s long been suspected that Russia is protecting its national oil-and-gas interests by funding anti-fracking activism—while not a new idea, the current attention makes it worth revisiting.

To the best of my knowledge, Russia’s reported involvement in shaping public opinion came to light in 2010, when different WikiLeaks revelations made public private intelligence from Stratfor—which had previously published a background brief on Shale Gas Activism—that speculated on Russian funding for the anti-fracking movie Gasland.

The idea that Russia is funding anti-fracking groups, such as the Sierra Club and the Natural Resource Defense Council, has popped up in a variety of outlets including the 2013 movie FrackNation, and in 2014 comments from NATO secretary general, Anders Fogh Rasmussen, the former Prime Minister of Denmark. And then, in late 2014, the New York Times featured a story titled: “Russian money suspected behind fracking protests.” In 2015, The Washington Free Beacon reported on a Bermudian firm that had connections to Russian oil interests and was funneling money to anti-fracking groups in the U.S.

Despite all the multiple claims linking Russia to anti-fracking activity, there’s been scant hard evidence.

But now, thanks to WikiLeaks, Russia’s reported anti-fracking funding is back in the headlines: “Leaked emails show Hillary Clinton blaming Russians for funding ‘phony’ anti-fracking groups,” wrote the Washington Times.

With knowledge only someone with a high-level security clearance and an understanding of foreign relations, like the Secretary of State, would have, Hillary, in a June 2014 speech in Edmonton Canada, reportedly said the following to an audience:

“We were up against Russia pushing oligarchs and others to buy media. We were even up against phony environmental groups, and I’m a big environmentalist, but these were funded by the Russians to stand against any effort, oh that pipeline, that fracking, whatever will be a problem for you, and a lot of the money supporting that message was coming from Russia.”

Remember, we are in an economic war and there are many who don’t want America to win. The cheap energy prices fracking has provided give the U.S. an economic advantage—hence the hostility toward it."
100755,1002,Charity Case? Clinton Foundation Can’t Escape Malfeasance Charges,http://www.breitbart.com/2016-presidential-race/2016/10/20/charity-case-clinton-foundation-cant-escape-malfeasance-charges/,28,"Even before Peter Schweizer’s book Clinton Cash hit bookshelves, Hillary Clinton and her campaign team repeatedly attacked the book’s findings and may have coordinated with major media outlets in an attempt to discredit it.
The efforts to discredit the book and the related news stories from organizations such as Media Matters and Politico have been extensive and determined.

Once the information about Clinton Foundation malfeasance was made public, it sent shockwaves through the not-for-profit community. Philanthropy has not only become big “business” over the decades, but the industry has worked hard to build extensive standards and ethical guidelines intended to protect the public from fraud and abuse.

The Lilly Family School of Philanthropy at the Indiana University campus in Indianapolis has become the MIT of philanthropy studies. Its Chronicle of Philanthropy is the guidepost for professional philanthropic activity. And many websites have emerged to help evaluate and rate private charities and give the public solid information to help them make wise decisions in their generous giving. CharityNavigator.org is considered the gold-standard for this information. And as the allegations against the Clintons began to emerge as valid criticism, Charity Navigator found itself in the crosshairs of the Clintons and their surrogates.

In March of 2015, Charity Navigator, reviewing the organization’s activity and in light of the news reports surrounding the release of Clinton Cash, placed the Clinton Foundation on its red-flag watch list. This initially gave credibility to the concerns raised in the book, and put Bill and HIllary Clinton in a precarious situation because of the website’s pristine reputation.

New York Magazine reports that the Clintons and their surrogates put heavy pressure on Charity Navigator trying to get the Foundation off the watchlist. The pressure seems to have been heavy and persistent, and apparently had the desired effect.

Last year, Charity Navigator removed the Foundation from its watch list after it released its 2014 IRS statement (Form 990). The group kept the initial warning page up for a time but eventually took it down. Speculation arose over the release of the 990 about fixing the books of the Foundation. This claim is denied, but new evidence has come to light which seem to reveal problems within the organization were widespread and greatly concerning.

In recent WikiLeaks revelations, problems exposed within the Clinton Foundation may be showing Charity Navigator’s first instinct was correct. New revelations about a “governance review” of the Clinton Foundation reveal the breadth of problems within the Foundation’s operations which in key points confirm the findings of Clinton Cash. And it includes the fact that donors to the Foundation had an expectation of a “quid pro quo” return from the Clintons because of their gifts.

The audit, commissioned by Chelsea Clinton, was conducted by New York law firm Simpson, Thacher & Bartlett, LLC in December 2011, revealed major problems with financial irregularities, board makeup, accountability standards and potential misuse of funds. It started a feud between Chelsea and Clinton Foundation executive Doug Band.

Bombshell revelations in the report were revealed in the report. The firm’s findings of pay-for-play contributions to the Foundation and its criticism of the “small insider board” which provided little or no oversight of the operations of the Foundation including the appropriate use of funds.

The review points to numerous areas where the Clinton Foundation ignored “best practices” for a not-for-profit. This prompted recommendations by Simpson, Thacher & Bartlett for serious changes in their operations. This included establishing an independent Advisory Board to initiate independent audits, implementing controls for how money is spent, implementing a conflict-of-interest policy and changing the way employees are compensated and correcting the conflicts of their employment with outside organizations.

The firm stressed that the board provide stronger management of the organization. They pointed to the fact that the board rarely met and gave little guidance to how the Foundation should be managed. The problem was so concerning to employees that they rated the effectiveness of the organization in the “low 1-4 level” on a scale of 1 to 10.

The review pointed to a lack of management of conflicts-of-interest with severe improvements needed to improve internal controls on spending and expense reimbursements pointing to a concerning misuse of funds. This included a concern that the Foundation might be running afoul of IRS rules requiring non-business related expenses be reported as taxable income.

The report stated that, “numerous [employees] commented that they believe that the Board
needs to take a more active role in overseeing and managing the Foundation and its finances,
programs, and activities.”

The report also pointed to concerns that the Foundation could be running afoul of the law if it did not expand the board moving from one “comprised solely of ‘insiders’” to one made up of outsiders who could better review the activities of the organization.

They urged them to appoint an independent Audit Committee which could hire an outside auditing firm to review problems of a lack of controls, develop a system to allow for “whistleblower complaints involving financial matters,” and review conflict-of-interest policies.

A major red flag they pointed to was that the board didn’t meet until the middle of the year to review the budget. And they strongly asserted “this weakness was not corrected even after being noted by auditors.”"
100756,1002,5 Times Democrats Claimed U.S. Elections Are ‘Rigged',http://www.breitbart.com/2016-presidential-race/2016/10/20/5-times-democrats-claimed-u-s-elections-rigged/,28,"Democrats are aghast that Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump would declare our election system “rigged,” and that he declined to state in the third presidential debate whether he would accept the result if he loses in November.
Trump is both wrong, and right, about the “rigged” nature of the system: in a fair system, Hillary Clinton would certainly not be her party’s candidate.

Regardless, Democrats — including Hillary Clinton — seem to have forgotten their own history of claiming elections are “rigged.”

1. 2000: Al Gore and the Florida recount. Yes, Gore eventually accepted the result — but only after withdrawing his concession, trying to have the vote recounted only in Democrat-heavy Florida counties, and suing to stop ballots from being recounted. Even after a consortium of media outlets concluded that George W. Bush had indeed won more votes in Florida, Democrats continued to claim the election had been “stolen” by the Supreme Court and Bush was an illegitimate president.

2. 2004: John Kerry and “rigged” machines. While Kerry conceded the election, he and his running mate continued to believe afterwards that the election had been stolen from them, possibly by voting machines. Elizabeth Edwards said in 2007 that she had been “very disappointed” in Kerry’s decision to concede the election. And last year the New Yorker reported that Kerry believed “proxies for Bush had rigged many voting machines” in Ohio, and that he may in fact have won the election.

3. 2008: John Podesta and Obama’s voter fraud. As the Wall Street Journal pointed out recently, President Barack Obama and Attorney General Eric Holder have suggested that voter ID laws are a way of rigging elections against black people. And while they downplay fears of voter fraud, Hillary Clinton campaign chair John Podesta reported internally (via Wikileaks) in 2015 that Clinton operatives believed that “the Obama forces flooded the caucuses with ineligible voters” to win the primary.

4. 2014: Congress and a “rigged” district system. Thanks to the Tea Party wave election in 2010 in response to Obamacare, Republicans were left in charge of many state legislatures as they redrew congressional district boundaries. Except in a few states — such as Illinois, where Democrats drew several Republicans out of their seats — that meant Republicans held the advantage in the House. As a result, Democrats complained bitterly that congressional elections were “rigged” against them.

5. 2016: Bernie Sanders and a “rigged” primary. Sanders uses the word “rigged” often to describe the economic system. But in 2016, the Democratic Party primary was rigged against him in a political sense — both openly, in the party’s anti-democratic super delegate system, and secretly, through collusion between party officials and the Clinton campaign. Sanders supporters protested at the Democratic National Convention in Philadelphia against what they called a “rigged” election.

Hillary Clinton herself has made at least one similar claim. National Review — which officially opposed Trump earlier this year — points out that Clinton told a private fundraiser in 2002 that George W. Bush had been “selected,” not “elected.”"
100757,1003,Hillary Clinton Should Campaign Against Political Gridlock,http://www.huffingtonpost.com/paul-abrams/dems-should-campaign-agai_b_12571938.html?utm_hp_ref=politics,28,"Without taking her eye off the ball, Hillary Clinton (D-NY) should immediately start campaigning against gridlock. Nancy Pelosi (D-CA) should nationalize the race for Congress on this issue. Same for Chuck Schumer (D-NY).

The American people hate gridlock. They hate that Congress does not do anything. And, worse, they hate that they get fat paychecks to achieve that nothing.

Senator John McCain (R-AZ) just handed the Democrats the issue of gridlock on a silver platter. He pledged that no nominees of President Clinton would be approved for the Supreme Court. None. Zero.

And, this pledge has a name: Merrick Garland, President Obama’s nominee to replace the late Antonin Scalia on the Supreme Court. Republicans had already shown their hand. McCain just reinforced it.

While on matters of policy—budget, spending, taxes, environment, and so forth—each side can accuse the other of being the roadblock, that is not true of presidential nominees. The President nominates, the Senate is supposed to act. Republicans have pledged not to act, and they are showing that they mean it.

It takes no work to vote “no”. Merrick Garland has not even had a hearing.

And, if Republicans are pledging their base that they will say “no” to everything a President Hillary Clinton proposes, then they are telling voters that they will collect $174,000 per year of taxpayers’ money for the privilege to do absolutely nothing.

Talk about welfare queens!

Of course, it takes work to forge compromises to fix peoples’ problems. If, on the other hand, they say they will work with President Clinton, challenge them to name the issue. Are they going to work with President Clinton to fix the problems in the Affordable Care Act? Because, it ain’t goin’ away, that option is off the table.

They will not say that. The Heritage Foundation has already stated that any Republican member who works to fix Obamacare will be a marked man or woman.

Same is true on all the major issues—raising the minimum wage; paycheck equity for women; major public works projects funded by increasing taxes on the wealthy. Republicans are in lock-step on all of these: “no”, “no”, “no”, “no”—-and, by the way, while I am voting all this noes, please hand me $174,000 for doing nothing.

One other suggestion. In states where Hillary is running ahead, such as New Hampshire, signs with Clinton, Kaine, and Hassan, with one name under the other, and ads to “Get on the Clinton, Kaine, Hassan” team are very effective. They penetrate the subliminal when people go to vote.

They might as well use the same strategy in other contested races such as Iowa, Nevada, Florida. And, now, of course, Arizona, to put McCain out to pasture. If the national campaign is against gridlock, let the Republicans in these states where Hillary is doing well have to explain to their base that they will work with her, or extol the virtues of gridlock.

It forces them into a horrible choice. And, they deserve every anxious moment of it."
100758,1003,Who’s Your Donald?,http://www.huffingtonpost.com/lynn-laplante-allaway/whos-your-donald_b_12438990.html?utm_hp_ref=politics,28,"All women know someone like Donald Trump. We’ve encountered him on the playground, where he bullied us; we went to high school with him, where he snapped our bra; he was that date-rapey dudebro in college that ranked you with a number based on your looks at his frat parties; he was your colleague that you had to make nice with but who constantly talked over you during meetings and took credit for your work; and if you’ve been really unlucky, he was your boss.

The reason women respond so viscerally to Donald is because we’ve experienced him before, in one of these permutations. He scared all of us and scarred some of us. After the vulgar tapes were released (filled with absolutely nothing surprising under the sun, if you’ve been paying any attention), suddenly everyone agreed unanimously that his behavior was unacceptable.

I’m not sure why this particular event was the tipping point since all evidence of his off-the-charts Creep Factor was there from the very beginning, but finally, everyone seemed to wake up from a drug-induced slumber at the same time. His fellow republicans rubbed their sleepy eyes and took to Twitter and Fox News to clutch their pearls and say how shocked—SHOCKED, I tell you!—they were about what they heard.

If you had a GOP Speak-to-English translator, it would say something like this: “I can’t believe he actually said those things! On tape! I mean, I totally agree and often say the same things myself but I always make sure there isn’t any tape rolling. Also, Donald, you rube, all you have to do is just legislate assaults on women! Pass strict laws concerning their bodies, make sure you pay them less than men in the workplace and restrict access to birth control. That’s how we do it! And make sure you’re maintaining a wholesome Family Values image the whole time, by the way.”

On Twitter, there was an unbelievably brilliant and horrifying dissection of Donald’s apology by Leah McElrath. She broke down the latent abusive techniques inherent in his statements. Read it and share it. And also on Twitter, Kelly Oxford asked her followers if they had any stories of sexual assault, like the type Donald could be heard bragging about on tape, and at last count...9.7 million women responded with their own tales. Yes, you read that right: 9.7 MILLION.

In that same vein, I was thinking if I had any “Donalds” in my life: men who made it difficult for me in the workplace by using the same tactics Donald is using on Hillary during his campaign and especially, during the debates. As probably most women would agree, the answer was yes. So I’m going to share my Donald story, which takes place in a symphony orchestra; feel free to share yours in the comments section, I would love to hear them.

But first, some background: I knew from day one that I was entering into a male dominated field and that it was also extremely competitive. I knew, for example, that sexism was so rampant in my field that they had to hold orchestra auditions behind a screen, so the audition committee couldn’t see what you looked like.

The screen wasn’t enough and a carpet strip was added to muffle the sounds of footsteps (women’s heels as opposed to men’s loafers, for example) on the stage. And also, you are not allowed to speak—not utter a sound—during these auditions, to further hide your identity. Because of this, the number of females in orchestras has skyrocketed.

But it’s still tough once you get in. I was in an Orchestral Studies program where we worked closely with members of the Chicago Symphony Orchestra, playing in their training orchestra and studying privately with their members. We were told, over and over in our lectures and seminars, that there was a long line of people standing behind us, just waiting for their chance to take our spot. We were taught not to make waves: if you had a problem with a colleague, suck it up and deal with it because it was too hard to win another audition in a different orchestra. That’s why, they said, they had members of the CSO who sat next to one another and played side-by-side, but hadn’t spoken a word to one another in 25 years.

So I was literally trained to put up and shut up. I was a free-lancer so I didn’t have job security. I was playing with the top groups but that could change overnight. My first year with a professional orchestra in Chicago, I was doing my best to be professional and fly below the radar: show up, do my job excellently and make a good impression as the newest and youngest member. All was going great until I got a call from the music librarian, the person in charge of marking all the parts and distributing them. This guy, let’s call him Donald, was only a few years older than me, but he had been there first and so had seniority.

Donald called me at home to tell me that he was under strict instructions from the orchestra to try and save money any way he possibly could. With this in mind, he wanted to save the postage and hand-deliver my first violin part for the upcoming ballet.

No, thank you, I said. Please mail them to me.

He insisted. I can only give you your part if you meet with me.

I told him I would pay for the postage myself, to just send it. He refused.

Enter my husband. I was very funny about my husband during this time in my career. A couple of years earlier, my violin teacher from the CSO whom I loved, respected and had known since I was a kid, wanted to schedule another coaching session before an upcoming audition. I told him I couldn’t make the evening he suggested because it was our first wedding anniversary and we were going out to celebrate. He told me that while I had been busy meeting my husband, dating him, planning a wedding and getting married, other violinists had been busy practicing. And now, I was auditioning against those other violinists. He told me not to let people know that I spent my time dating and getting married, for it would put me at a disadvantage in their eyes. In contrast, getting married lent my husband an air of maturity and respectability for his career in finance.

I remember crying on the entire walk home from my lesson where I unloaded on my new, non-musician husband, telling him we had to cancel our dinner reservations. I’ll never forget what he said to me: “He may be one of the greatest violinists out there, but there are other measures of success in life and I don’t count someone struggling through their third marriage as someone who should be giving out relationship advice.”

So when I told my husband about my creepy Donald, he said, “Tell him a day and time to deliver the music and I’ll be here waiting for him. Problem solved.” My husband played Division 1 football in college and is a really big dude. That would solve the problem, but I was afraid to use him as my muscle, for fear of calling unwanted attention to myself. I told him I’d just refuse and insist that Donald mail me my parts.

So I did. Again. And again.

And that’s when my Donald told me how cute my dog was.

What, I asked? How do you know?

He described my dog in detail and told me he really liked to ride his bike along the lakefront and in the parks in my neighborhood and he’d been seeing me a lot, while I was out walking my dog.

“Maybe one of those times, I’ll stop and we can talk. Or I can bring you the music then.”

I told him again, send my music in the mail. Again, he refuse, saying he would just bring it to the first rehearsal instead, which meant I wouldn’t be able to practice my part ahead of time, putting me at a disadvantage.

At the first ballet rehearsal, he walked up to me, and very coldly shoved my violin part in my hands. I took it back with me to the last stand of the first violins, where I was sitting alone in the small section for the pit orchestra. I opened my part and saw that it was completely blank: he gave me an unmarked part.

This means that there were just the music notes but no bowings, no cues, no cuts— no additional information about the performance we were giving. These are the markings that he was getting paid as librarian to make and he didn’t do it. It’s akin to giving someone a complicated baking recipe with the ingredients listed, but giving no measurements, cooking times or even an oven temperature.

I did my best during rehearsal, trying to follow the bowings of the Concertmaster, but I was often off from the rest of the section. I scribbled notes and bowings, changes in tempo in my part, while trying to blend in. The conductor was shooting me dirty looks, so I went up to him to apologize and explain what was happening during our break.

I told him I had an unmarked part because that is what I was given and I was doing my best to get the bowings. He said, and I’ll never forget this, “Of course you’ll get the right bowings. Because if you don’t, you’re fired.” And he walked away. I looked over at my Donald who was watching from afar, smiling at me.

That happened fifteen years ago. The 2016 version of me would NEVER take that kind of shit. I now have more wisdom, experience and most importantly, confidence. I have such a strong sense of self now that I didn’t have when I was first starting out professionally. I would never allow myself to be treated that way today: I would never, ever be quiet. And I would absolutely ask for help now, make a fuss and accept no blame for somebody else’s poor behavior. But it took me fifteen years to get from there to here; you don’t develop professional confidence overnight.

Most women who are professionals have stories of their own personal Donald. He’s everywhere. It’s hard to stand up to men like him, because they are so good at what they do: bullying, intimidating, harassing. We’ve been trained and told, implicitly or not, to be “nice,” to not make a scene, to get along. The more we women speak up, and the more men stand up for us in the face of discrimination, the harder it will be for men like Donald to pull their crap.

I can’t even imagine the stories Hillary must have about being mistreated on her rise to becoming (please, God) the first female President of the United States. She has held her head high while being attacked during these debates; while being stalked by Donald with his weird creeping and leering; while being constantly and repeatedly interrupted; by being threatened with imprisonment, for God’s sake! By doing so with such quiet strength, she is paving the way for all of us and exposing Donald and his ilk for the predatory scumbags they are.

And for that I’d like to say: thank you, Hillary."

Its earliest documented use was in 1481 but perhaps no word in English, or French, can more aptly describe the current Republican candidate for the most powerful job in the world. Donald Trump fits the three meanings to a T, judging by his performance in three presidential debates. Alarmingly, for most citizens of this great democracy and for the rest of the world, his trumpery is unparalleled in American presidential politics, if we are to believe respected historians.

It is also almost beyond comparison in current global electoral politics. I say almost, because there is one elected head of state, Rodrigo Duterte of the Philippines, who runs neck and neck with Trump in displaying sheer undemocratic chutzpah. Neither the demagogic Viktor Orban of Hungary nor any of the rest of the world’s elected leaders come close, not even Putin, whom Trump seems to idealize as a powerful and smart leader. The Russian leader is indeed smart. He plays it cool, with a smile and bland denials of anything that might be wrong with what he and his cronies do abroad or at home, as he exerts near total control over the Russian state.

But whereas Putin employs a stiletto style in political tactics, Trump prefers the wrecking ball. After last night’s debate performance, little doubt remains that Trump, in order to get his way even as he loses, is ready to wreck the nation’s democratic structure that has served Americans well for more than two centuries. He appeared almost ready to revive the crisis of 1860 if need be by ominously suggesting he may not accept the election results on November 8 as legitimate and egging his followers on to prepare for possibly violent confrontations after the election. And the morning after the final debate he clarified he would “totally accept” the result “if I win”.

Despite having covered two presidential elections in the US as a foreign correspondent and being in the White House press corps for five years in the 1980s and 90s, I confess I cannot bring myself to comprehend the enormity of the Trump phenomenon. Is it real or just a show?

Anxiety over profound changes going on rapidly around the world and in American society may be herding voters behind a candidate who promises radical change to make America great again but in fact signals a retreat to a past that many fear may soon be gone. But there were other conservative candidates who they rejected in favor of this one supposed savior. Why?

If, for instance, we contrast his threatening style with Hillary Clinton’s measured but admittedly vanilla style of campaigning, we could find it baffling how nearly 40% of likely voters remain resolutely behind Trump while Clinton, despite extending her opinion polls lead in recent weeks, continues to struggle defending her suitability for the job against persistently negative vibes on nebulous issues like trustworthiness and likability. Is there a word to explain her plight?

There is. It’s a word coined by the comedian Stephen Colbert and now included in dictionaries. It’s ‘truthiness’, which dictionary.com defines as “the quality of seeming to be true according to one’s intuition, opinion or perception without regard to logic, factual evidence or the like”. It might explain why a person, who had approval ratings in the mid-60s percentile range when she was secretary of state and who was twice elected as a senator with impressive majorities, fell so far in approval ratings soon after she became an announced cabdidate for the presidency.

In numerous conversations over the past year with critics of Clinton — not only from the right, but from the left and from moderates who would ‘hold their nose’ in voting for her — I have heard a theme: She is somehow neither likable nor trustworthy. Why exactly no one says, other than citing three recurring points: emails, Benghazi and the Clintons’ ‘sordid’ record in the 90s.

The emails charge is substantive but at the end of the day it’s a bureaucratic blunder that was acknowledged by the candidate repeatedly as a mistake and subsequently regarded by the FBI after a thorough investigation as undeserving of further pursuit. Yet, to many Clinton skeptics it continues to stink. Some even echo Trump in suspecting the veracity of the FBI’s conclusion.

Her alleged culpability in what happened in the US consulate in Benghazi when she was secretary of state, has been investigated by Congress ad nauseum without being proven. But the theme continues to reverberate, particularly on the right. Kevin McCarthy, the Republican majority leader in the House, nailed the truthiness of it when he gleefully said on TV that Clinon’s approval ratings were once high but were brought down by the Republicans shouting “...Benghazi, Benghazi, Benghazi”. It may be baloney but it stirs up doubts about her credibility. There’s no smoking gun but there’s a whole lot of smoke generated by her political opponents.

As for the Clintons’ record in the 1990s, it is mostly a highly impressive one apart from the glaring stain of Bill Clinton’s inexplicably stupid sexual behavior with a White House intern. But it was Bill, not Hillary. Nevertheless, Hillary’s action or inaction at the time continues to be lumped with her husband’s infidelity to have the adjective ‘sordid’ haunt the Clintons’ past.

There is a lot in their past that can be debated, for and against, legitimately. But Hillary Clinton’s share of it has hardly ever deserved a labelling of sordidness. Whitewater, Travelgate, Vince Foster were all accusations emerging almost entirely from an aggressive Republican political strategy and each of which turned out in the late 90s to be a haze of smoke without any real fire. No matter, a truthiness-driven narrative effectively hammered away at a strikingly qualified presidential candidate’s credibility.

So, here we are less than three weeks away from a presidential election in which the choice is stark: Can too many citizens risk staying at home on November 8 with an incendiary candidate for president on the loose? Or will a thumping majority of Americans reject trumpery in order to reinforce the still sound foundations of liberal democracy by ignoring truthiness?"
100760,1004,Obama Roasts Rubio: You Call Trump A 'Con Artist' But You'll Vote For Him?,http://talkingpointsmemo.com/livewire/obama-roasts-marco-rubio-trump,28,"President Barack Obama read Sen. Marco Rubio (R-FL), and, by proxy, the entire Republican Party, the riot act on Thursday for supporting Donald Trump despite previously condemning him.

Speaking at a Thursday afternoon rally on behalf of Hillary Clinton in Miami Gardens, Florida, Obama didn't hold back, shredding Rubio for supporting Trump despite previously calling him a ""con artist"" and an ""erratic individual.""

""I agree with the U.S. senator, a Republican, who a while back said that we can't afford to give the nuclear codes of the United States to an erratic individual,"" Obama said to cheers from the crowd. ""By the way, you know who said that? Marco Rubio!""

Obama cited Rubio's comments from February, when he called Trump a ""con artist.""

""Say it again!"" an attendee shouted.

""Do you want me to say it again?"" Obama asked. ""He said, Marco Rubio said, this was a dangerous con artist who spent a lifetime, spent a career, sticking it to working people! Now that begs the question, since we're in Florida: why does Marco Rubio still plan to vote for Donald Trump?""

Obama acknowledged the differences between the two major parties, but suggested that politicians shouldn't make decisions solely on the basis of partisanship or the advancement of their own careers.

""Trump didn't come out of nowhere,"" he said, citing the rise of Republican politicians and far-right news outlets who have promoted conspiracy theories like birtherism, the long-refuted claim that Obama was not born in the United States.

""They've been saying crazy stuff, and there are a lot of politicians like Marco Rubio who know better, but they just look the other way,"" he said.

Obama blamed politicians like Rubio for encouraging far-right conspiracy theories and obstructing Democrat-backed political initiatives to gain popular support.

""They just stood by and said nothing, even though they knew better, while their base actually started believing some of this stuff,"" he said.

He went on to shred Republican members of Congress for standing by Trump through a flood of controversies, including his ""bromance with Putin,"" his comments calling Mexican immigrants ""criminals and rapists,"" and his attacks on a Gold Star family.

""I don't give a lot of credit to folks who are just now trying to walk away from Trump. Although I will say I'm even more confused by Republican politicians who still support Donald Trump,"" Obama added, turning his attention back to Rubio. ""How can you call him a con artist and dangerous and object to all the controversial things he says and then say, but I'm still going to vote for him? Come on, man.""

But he wasn't done.

Obama gave Rubio credit for condemning Trump's claims that the election will be rigged, but pointed out that Rubio has not withdrawn his support.

""He's refuting the dangerous and unprecedented claims of a candidate he says he's still going to vote for!"" Obama said. ""Which just gives you one more bit of proof that Marco seems to just care about hanging onto his job.""

While Obama wrapped up his speech on a more optimistic note, citing healthcare, immigration reform and the economic recovery as successes, he apparently couldn't resist the opportunity to take one last jab at Rubio before he left the stage.

""Progress is on the ballot. Stability is on the ballot. Tolerance is on the ballot. Justice is on the ballot. Equality is on the ballot. Our democracy is on the ballot. Hillary Clinton will advance those things,"" Obama said. ""Donald Trump wants to reverse progress. Marco Rubio wants to help him."""
100761,1004,Trump: Clinton Should Resign Over Allegedly Leaked Town Hall Question,http://talkingpointsmemo.com/livewire/trump-says-clinton-should-resign-debate-question,28,"Donald Trump on Thursday said that Hillary Clinton should resign from the presidential race after hacked emails published by WikiLeaks suggested her campaign received a question ahead of time before a Democratic primary town hall.

""It was just learned that Hillary Clinton was given the exact questions to a previous debate word for word by Donna Brazile, who is now under tremendous pressure to resign from the DNC, as she should be,” Trump said. “But I ask you, why shouldn't Hillary Clinton resign from the race? She was given these questions. She used these questions, studied the questions, got the perfect answer for the questions and never said that she did something that was totally wrong and inappropriate, hence the name Crooked Hillary.”

Trump didn’t mention, or perhaps he didn’t know, that in the hacked email Brazile appeared to leak a single question to Clinton about the death penalty. According to the email, that tip came a day before a CNN Democratic primary town hall with then-opponent Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-VT), not a debate.

Brazile left her position as a CNN commentator this summer to chair the Democratic National Committee. CNN has denied giving out any questions ahead of time, and Brazile has denied both having access to any questions and sharing any questions with the Clinton campaign.

“Donna Brazile, she should resign,” Trump said, after diverting from his attack to discuss a decades-old scandal in which a contestant on a TV show was given correct answers by the show’s producers. “She looked like such a fool last night on television trying to say, well, she didn't know what was going on. She had no idea. She said, get me out of here. She got the questions.”

Trump has tweeted about Brazile's alleged leak to the Clinton campaign twice this past week, including after an interview Brazil did with Fox News' Megyn Kelly after the debate: “She gave them to Hillary Clinton,” he continued. “Hillary Clinton didn't say ‘I’d like to announce that a mistake was made and I can't take these'—I mean, look, how many questions are there, right? Can you imagine if I got the questions? They would call for the re-establishment of the electric chair. Do you agree with that? She got the questions and didn't report it. She went out there knowing the questions. She didn't report it. That is very dishonest. She's a very dishonest person.""

Meanwhile, Trump has benefitted heartily from receiving questions—or, in fact, dictating questions—ahead of campaign events. Before an appearance on “The Dr. Oz Show” meant to assure voters that he would be transparent with information about his health, Dr. Mehmet Oz told the Fox News radio program “Kilmeade & Friends,” that “I’m not going to ask him questions he doesn’t want to have answered.”

Trump also has hosted multiple prime time televised town hall events with Fox News host and supporter Sean Hannity, who also appeared in an advertisement for Trump. Hannity once asked Trump whether he had ever watched ISIS beheading videos.

Ahead of a campaign stop at a black church in Detroit, Michigan, the New York Times published the Trump campaign’s script for the event, showing that Trump had access to the planned questions ahead of time."
100762,1004,Trump: I’ll Accept The Results Of The Presidential Election ‘If I Win’,http://talkingpointsmemo.com/livewire/donald-trump-accept-presidential-election-if-win,28,"A day after declining to affirm that he would accept the result of the presidential election, Donald Trump said he will do so “if I win.”

“I want to make a major announcement today,” he told supporters at a rally in Delaware, Ohio. “I would like to promise and pledge to all of my voters and supporters and to all of the people of the United States that I will totally accept the results of this great and historic presidential election if I win.”

Yet later in his speech, after recycling unfounded accusations that the presidential race will be rigged as a result of mass voter fraud, Trump said he would “of course” accept “a clear election result.”

His hesitation to say so at the final presidential debate, he said, was intended to leave open the possibility of a legal challenge if something goes awry.

“I would also reserve my right to contest or file a legal challenge in the case of a questionable result,” Trump said. “And always I will follow and abide by all the rules and traditions of all of the many candidates who have come before me, always. Bottom line, we're going to win.”

The Republican nominee took issue with moderator Chris Wallace asking him the “unprecedented” question of whether he would respect the outcome of the race and agree to a peaceful transfer of power, which he interpreted as a call to concede the race prematurely.

As many of his surrogates have done since Wednesday’s debate, Trump invoked the 2000 election as an example of the unforeseen circumstances that can come up in a presidential race.

“If Al Gore or George Bush had agreed three weeks before the election to concede the results and waived their right to a legal challenge or a recount, then there would be no Supreme Court case and no Gore v. Bush or Bush v. Gore,” he said. “And there have been numerous other cases. In effect, I'm being asked to waive centuries of legal precedent designed to protect the voters.”

Gore initially conceded the race and only agreed to a recount in Florida after an automatic recount of ballots showed he trailed Bush by much fewer votes in that state than the initial count reported.

Trump went on to cite a Pew report that found 24 million invalid or insignificant voter registrations in the U.S. as proof that fraud was rampant. Yet Pew and other elections experts note that these invalid registrations are caused by clerical error and outdated databases, and that cases of people actually casting ballots illegally are exceedingly rare.

In Trump’s estimation, despite the elaborate rigging in Hillary Clinton’s favor and the many polls showing him trailing the Democratic nominee, he won’t have to launch a legal challenge to the elections results because he will win.

“Always I will follow and abide by all of the rules and traditions of all of the many candidates who have come before me,” he said. “Always. Bottom line, we're going to win. Bottom line, we're going to win. We're going to win. We're going to win so big. We're going to win so big.”"
100763,1005,"Trump: I'll Respect Election Results—""If I Win""",http://www.motherjones.com/politics/2016/10/donald-trump-says-he-will-respect-election-results-if-i-win,28,"The morning after he refused to promise he would accept the results of next month's election, GOP nominee Donald Trump continued to stoke fears of a ""rigged"" election during a speech at an Ohio rally.

""I will totally accept the results of this great and historic presidential election—if I win,"" he said, drawing cheers from the crowd.

Trump rattled off statistics from a 2012 Pew Charitable Trusts study finding that voter registration systems are ""plagued with errors and inefficiencies."" He cited the report as evidence that millions of people are committing voter fraud to help Hillary Clinton. The report does not make that argument, and voting experts say that voter fraud is exceedingly rare.

But Trump also attempted to legitimize his statement at last night's debate. He told the crowd that his claim that he would ""look at [results] at the time"" before deciding whether to accept them was akin to Al Gore's contesting of the vote in Florida in 2000. (It's not.) ""I'm being asked to waive centuries of legal precedent designed to protect the voters"" by committing to accept the election outcome, he claimed. He also said he would ""respect a clear result, but also I would also reserve my right to contest or file a legal challenge in the event of a questionable result."" What constitutes a questionable result was left unmentioned."
100764,1005,Another Woman Accuses Trump of Groping Her,http://www.motherjones.com/politics/2016/10/another-woman-accuses-donald-trump-groping-her,28,"Yet another woman accused Donald Trump on Thursday of groping her—the 10th woman to accuse the Republican presidential candidate of unwanted sexual contact in the past eight days.

At a press conference with famed women's rights attorney Gloria Allred, Karena Virginia alleged that in 1998, Trump groped her at the US Open Tennis Tournament. In her statement, Virginia claimed that Trump approached her while she was waiting for a car to pick her up and drive her home. ""Hey, look at this one,"" Trump said, according to Virginia. ""We haven't seen her before. Look at those legs."" She said Trump then grabbed her arm before putting his hand on her breast. ""I was in shock,"" Virginia said. ""I flinched. 'Don't you know who I am? Don't you know who I am?' That's what he said to me,"" she alleged.

Virginia said no one asked her to come forward, but that she did so in support of the other women who have made allegations against Trump.

Allred admitted to being a supporter of Hillary Clinton but said she had no contact with the campaign regarding her allegations or those of former Apprentice contestant Summer Zervos, another accuser who held a press conference with Allred last week.

According to Allred, Virginia is not planning to pursue a lawsuit.

The issue of Trump's unwanted sexual advances toward women has sparked a firestorm just weeks before the election. On October 8, the Washington Post released a video showing Trump making lewd comments about his interactions with women in 2005. Since the release, 10 women have come forward to accuse him of groping or kissing them without their consent. "
100765,1005,Here's an Interesting Little Nugget From the FBI Records Release No One Is Talking About,http://www.motherjones.com/politics/2016/10/FBI-records-release-bill-clintons-secret-service-agent-it-work-clinton-foundation,28,"The FBI released on Monday the fourth and last batch of interview summaries related to its investigation of Hillary Clinton's use of a private home email server during her time as secretary of state. The files to date have summarized Clinton's July 4 weekend interview with agents, the technical details behind the server, and some complicated aspects of the relationship between the State Department and the FBI.

But they also included another interesting nugget.

In a summary from May 25, 2016, one of the US Secret Service agents assigned to protect former President Bill Clinton told FBI investigators that he was also ""asked to do network assessments and troubleshoot IT issues at the Clinton Foundation"" in addition to his full-time job of protecting the former president. His apparent ""information technology (IT) skills"" were tapped to assist ""in a case related to the theft of information on the Clinton Foundation information systems."" The agent also told the FBI that after being contacted by longtime Clinton aide Justin Cooper, he helped another Clinton aide, Bryan Pagliano, research a security issue with the Clinton's home email server.

The US Secret Service is tasked with protecting the president, former presidents, and a handful of other high-ranking US politicians, along with foreign dignitaries who visit the United States. The agency, among the nation's oldest federal law enforcement organizations, also investigates threats against those it protects and investigates crimes related to financial fraud. It's unclear whether the work the agent described would violate any department regulations. The Secret Service did not respond to questions about the matter. The Clinton campaign and the Clinton Foundation also did not respond to any questions. Cooper and Pagliano have both been embroiled in the private email server controversy from the very beginning. They helped the Clintons set up the email server in the first place, according to Politico Magazine, and Pagliano maintained the home email server as someone who worked for Hillary Clinton both at the State Department and privately. In 2015 he invoked his Fifth Amendment protections against self-incrimination during one of the lawsuits related to records about the server, and was one of five people who were given limited immunity deals from the FBI as part of its investigation into the case."
100766,1006,"Poll: Majority of Republicans say Trump, not Paul Ryan, represents what the GOP should stand for politically",http://hotair.com/archives/2016/10/20/poll-majority-republicans-say-trump-not-paul-ryan-represents-gop-stand-politically/,28,"A perfect complement to yesterday’s post showing Ryan’s favorable rating now underwater among … Republicans.

It’s Trump’s party now. And by “now,” I mean “for the next 19 days.” I’ll give you three theories for that, none of them mutually exclusive. One: The GOP’s base isn’t nearly as “conservatarian” as movement conservatives would like. Ted Cruz learned that the hard way in the primaries, right? Much of the base is populist first and foremost, and that populism trends strongly towards nationalist/reactionary politics, not classical liberalism. Republican voters, especially Trump’s white working-class fans, care little for conservative economics as practiced by Randians like Ryan. They’re Republican chiefly because that party is their best vehicle for white identity politics and culture war waged against left-wing political correctness.

Two: It’s immigration, stupid. As America’s demographics have continued to change, the right has become more sensitive to that change accelerating by importing millions of workers from Mexico, Asia, and so on. Some significant chunk of the base has effectively decided that immigration is so urgently important that the right position on borders can excuse the wrong position on virtually anything else. (Ahem.) And Paul Ryan most definitely has the wrong position on borders. His House caucus has held the line against Obama’s executive amnesties, knowing that the revolt among the base would have been even worse this year if they’d caved, but Ryan has been soft on amnesty for years, even partnering with open-borders shill Luis Gutierrez on proposals. If Ryan had been a Sessions-style border hawk all along, he wouldn’t be in this much trouble.

Three: This isn’t about policy, it’s about rank tribalism. A presidential election is political war and Trump, not Ryan, is the general right now. It doesn’t matter which policies Trump and Ryan do and don’t agree on. The hard fact of the matter for many Republicans is that Ryan fragged Trump the day after the “Access Hollywood” tape came out; asking them now who better represents their politics is like asking them if they prefer their commanding officer to the insubordinate who tried to murder him. However, once Trump’s no longer in command, that preference might shift. In fact…

“What is clear in these data is that a large segment of Trump supporters are all-in with the candidate. They see him as capable of delivering on the promise of a greater nation. That said, just 38 percent of them say they will stay loyal and follow his future endeavors if he does not win,” said pollster J. Ann Selzer, who oversaw the survey ahead of the final debate Wednesday. “If he were to lose, our data suggest his standing would diminish.”
Thirty-eight percent ain’t peanuts but Trump’s support within the party is soft enough that he finished second, not first, in Bloomberg’s poll when Republicans were asked who the leader of the party will be if Trump goes on to lose the election. Mike Pence finished on top with 27 percent. Trump was second at 24 percent, then Ted Cruz at 19, then Ryan at 15. (When given a binary choice between Trump and Ryan in yesterday’s YouGov poll, slightly more Republicans said Ryan is the leader of the party, not Trump — another sign of Trump’s support softening.) Trump’s favorable rating within his own party stands at 76 percent, fully 15 points lower than Mitt Romney’s rating among Republicans at this time four years ago. There are some Trump loyalists who will stick with him after the election no matter what — there had better be, for the sake of Trump TV — but there’s also room for Ryan, Cruz, etc to rehab their own images as the tribal pressures of the election ease. In particular, Ryan will emerge by pure circumstance as Hillary Clinton’s biggest headache in the Republican Party. If the Senate flips to the Democrats, as is likely to happen, and the GOP holds on in the House, the only thing stopping Clinton from ramming through her agenda will be Ryan and his caucus. Unless he’s foolish enough to sell out the base on immigration, he’ll have many opportunities to earn back goodwill among Republicans by thwarting their least favorite Democrat. His numbers should rise. But as I say, all bets are off if he caves on amnesty."
100767,1006,Jake Tapper hammers Think Progress for publishing story it knew was false,http://hotair.com/archives/2016/10/20/jake-tapper-hammers-think-progress-publishing-story-knew-false/,28,"One of the things that has become clear in the wake of Wikileaks dump of Podesta emails is that a lot of journalists have a very cozy—one could even say sycophantic— relationship with Democrats. We saw that with this email from Glenn Thrush: And this one from John Harwood: There’s more from Harwood but let’s not forget TVOne’s Roland Martin passing a question to CNN’s Donna Brazile who then passed it to Clinton’s team in advance.

There is one notable exception to this trend and his name is Jake Tapper. Back in May 2009, Think Progress (a site connected to the Center for American Progress) contacted Tapper about a story it was preparing. The story Think Progress wanted to tell was simple, in fact it literally had three simple steps:

Step one: “Right-Wing Radio Gives Corporate Hedge Funds A Venue To Attack Obama”
Step two: “Right-Wing Pressures White House Reporters To Take Up Its Attack”
Step three: “ABC’s Jake Tapper Picks It Up, Drudge Promotes It”
The problem is that the author of the piece knew steps one and two had no connection to step three before the story was published. We know this because Wikileaks released an email in which Tapper responded to TP’s request for clarification of how he learned about the story and why he decided to cover it. And, surprise, it did not involve listening to the pleas of right-wing radio hosts.

But Think Progress went ahead and published the piece anyway under the headline “Right-Wing Radio Successfully Gets ABC’s Jake Tapper To Take Up Its Attack Against Obama.” Here is Tapper’s understandably outraged response:

As I told you many times off the record, both in email and on the phone, the premise of your story is just false.

You nonetheless wrote it anyway, indicating quite clearly that you don’t care about accuracy or the truth in your reporting.

You wanted to push a narrative that I was used by the right wing media, so you wrote what you wrote regardless of the facts. That’s shoddy journalism, and it’s simply not reflective of the truth.

As I told you, I heard of Lauria’s claims when I overheard Ann Compton talking with someone at ABC News radio about Lauria’s interview. That was the last I heard of it.

I was interested in speaking with someone representing the hedge funds since President Obama spoke so strongly against them. Friday I was busy with Justice Souter’s story, so I didn’t get a chance to look into it.

On Saturday, I found Lauria’s interview on the WJR-AM website. I looked into Lauria, found him to be a credible voice, a leading bankruptcy attormey who indeed had represented the firm in question. Moreover, he had recently given $10,000 to the DSCC so he had no discernible partisan motives.

I reached out to the White House, they denied Lauria’s story, which we gave prominence in the story.

Nothing in your story about my reporting on this matter is accurate. No one pressured me, no one peddled anything to me, and no one reached out to me to cover this. Indeed, the first I heard of Mark Levin pushing this story was on your post.

The fact that you don’t mention Lauria’s giving money to Democrats is quite telling. This is inaccurate and you should be ashamed to have written it after I told you what happened.

Jake
If you visit the story now you’ll see there are 3 updates at the bottom including one from ABC denying the claims made in the post (which Think Progress already knew) and one about changing the misleading headline.

Yesterday someone on Twitter said Jake Tapper is the only journalists who looks better after the WikiLeaks dump of Podesta’s emails. I think that’s probably right. "
100768,1006,Trump: I will totally accept the election results — if I win,http://hotair.com/archives/2016/10/20/trump-will-totally-accept-election-results-win/,28,"Ed flagged this earlier in an update but it’s the soundbite of the day, so here’s a separate thread. A Twitter pal argues that Trump is obviously joking here. Sort of, yeah — he’s trolling, knowing that the media has spent the last 12 hours hyperventilating over what he said last night at the debate and that this will have them reaching for an oxygen tank. I think this is best described as “kidding on the square,” though. He’s saying it half-jokingly, knowing that his fans will love his defiance (note the dramatic pointing at the crowd followed by a big smile), but this really is the Trump ethos in microcosm. Whatever favors Trump is good and legitimate, whatever disfavors him is bad and illegitimate. No process can truly be fair if it produces a bad outcome for him. You see this all the time from him, in ways very big and small. Much of the reason he refuses to slam Putin, I think, is because Putin’s a rare member of the international political class who’s spoken admiringly of Trump. How bad a guy can he really be?

Whether it’s the best use of a major-party nominee’s time to be trolling the media 19 days out from election day, I leave to you to decide. It does, however, fit the nature of Trump’s campaign at this point, which is mostly “fan service” for core supporters. He tried outreach to the middle in September by briefly softening on immigration and speaking to some black audiences. And it worked! The polls narrowed. But then he lost the first debate and things started going sideways, then the tape came out, then his accusers started coming forward, and now we’re here. He might as well make his fans happy, not only to buoy morale and keep them excited to turn out next month but to shore up their interest in TrumpTV or whatever’s coming after the election.

Speaking of outreach to the middle, here’s an … interesting tweet last night from the person who’s widely assumed to have quarterbacked that strategy within the campaign. That’s the second time in a week that Conway’s used her Twitter account to suggest displeasure with Trump’s Trumpier excesses. Kellyanne’s inching towards the lifeboats.

Interestingly, Maine Gov. Paul LePage, who’s probably the Trumpiest politician in the GOP apart from Trump himself, said this morning of the debate last night, “Not accepting the results, I think, is a stupid comment. I mean, c’mon. Get over yourself.” Trump may find himself with fewer allies than he expects on election night if he loses by, say, five points and then goes out for his concession speech and calls the results bogus. The members of his inner circle with nothing to lose, like Giuliani or Gingrich, will back him up, but the wider party might just throw up its hands and disown him. Reince Priebus, in fact, said just last night that the RNC will accept the results of the election. All of these people — LePage, Priebus, Conway, Pence — are trying to signal to Trump right now that if he goes down the “rigged” road when this is over, he’d better understand that he’s going alone. But maybe Trump’s okay with that. The lonelier he is in crying that the election’s illegitimate, the more it’ll polish his reputation among his biggest fans that he’s willing to do and say the politically incorrect things that cowardly Republicans aren’t willing to.

Here’s this morning’s soundbite followed by a clip of disgraced DNC hack Debbie Wasserman Schultz insisting one month ago that Al Gore won Florida in 2000, which is an out-and-out lie but flattering to cranks on the left who need to believe, despite all evidence, that George W. Bush was “selected, not elected.” Among those cranks, by the way: Hillary Clinton. "

Hillary claimed that the District of Columbia v. Heller Supreme Court decision was about toddlers having guns.

No, it wasn’t…


Sean Davis wrote a killer piece over at The Federalist that you should check out.

From Weasel Zippers via The Federalist: It’s a lie so absurd that I honestly don’t know where to begin, but I’ll give it a shot: No, the Heller decision was not about toddlers. It had nothing to do with toddlers. Nothing. It’s no coincidence that the word “toddler” doesn’t appear in either the majority or dissenting opinions in the case. Nor does the word “toddler” appear anywhere in the 110-page transcript of the case’s oral arguments before the Supreme Court. Because the case had absolutely nothing to do with toddlers.

No mention of toddlers. Because the case wasn’t about toddlers. It was about whether the District of Columbia’s “total ban on handguns” — theSupreme Court’s characterization of the law at issue in the case — was constitutional. The Supreme Court ruled that D.C.’s ban on handguns was unconstitutional and that Heller, a police officer, had a constitutional right to own and bear a firearm in his home. It had nothing whatsoever to do with toddlers.


If Clinton opposes an individual’s constitutional right to keep and bear arms to protect his or her family, she should just come out and say so instead of blatantly lying about the Supreme Court’s decision on the matter. But it gets better: after claiming that the Heller decision was all about toddlers, Hillary then claimed that the Constitution guarantees a right to partial-birth abortion, a practice that requires an abortionist to rip an unborn baby from the womb, stab or crush her skull, and then vacuum out her brains. Because Hillary Clinton’s top priority is protecting innocent children from violence.

Hillary loves to just make things up and see what sticks.

Lucky for her, it all sticks because everyone in the media just repeats it as gospel.

If you watched last night’s debate, and you have a kindergarten level understanding of the issues, you know that she was completely lost up there.

2A supporters are in big trouble if Hillary manages to get to the White House."
100770,1007,Here Are The Top 5 Lies From Hillary’s Final Debate Performance,http://www.youngcons.com/here-are-the-top-5-lies-from-hillarys-final-debate-performance/,28,"Hillary Clinton told a lot of lies last night during the final presidential debate.

It was hard to keep track to be quite honest.

She has made it very clear that she has a really difficult time telling the truth.

Aaron Bandler is great at laying out this kind of stuff so here he is.

The top 5 lies from Hillary Clinton’s disastrous debate performance.

From The Daily Wire:


The DC v. Heller case involved toddlers. “What the District of Columbia was trying to do was to protect toddlers from guns and so they wanted people with guns to safely store them,” Clinton said.  “And the court didn’t accept that reasonable regulation, but they’ve accepted many others.”

This is a lie that is so patently absurd that it warrants a laugh-track on a comedy show. Anybody who has a basic understanding of the Heller case knows that it has literally nothing to do with toddlers. Sean Davis explains in The Federalist that “the word ‘toddler; doesn’t appear in either the majority or dissenting opinions in the case. Nor does the word ‘toddler’ appear anywhere in the 110-page transcript of the case’s oral arguments before the Supreme Court.” That’s because the case involved a 66 year-old police officer named Dick Heller challenging D.C.’s handgun ban, since he argued that the Second Amendment protected his constitutional right to own a handgun in his home. The court ruled in his favor. Hillary lied about the barbaric practice of partial-birth abortion. When Trump was asked about partial-birth abortions, he replied, “If you go with what Hillary is saying, in the ninth month, you can take the baby and rip the baby out of the womb of the mother just prior to the birth of the baby.”

After Trump finished his answer, Clinton immediately lied: “Well, that is not what happens in these cases. And using that kind of scare rhetoric is just terribly unfortunate.”


The below video illustrates the process of partial-birth abortions, which involves pulling the baby partially out of the womb except for its head. The abortionist proceeds to cause an incision on the baby head’s through the use of scissors before using a suction catheter to destroy the baby’s brain, demolishing its skull.

Hillary lied about the barbaric practice of partial-birth abortion. When Trump was asked about partial-birth abortions, he replied, “If you go with what Hillary is saying, in the ninth month, you can take the baby and rip the baby out of the womb of the mother just prior to the birth of the baby.”

The abortionist proceeds to cause an incision on the baby head’s through the use of scissors before using a suction catheter to destroy the baby’s brain, demolishing its skull.

Hillary somehow said with a straight face that she won’t increase the national debt. “If you look at the debt, which is the issue you asked about, Chris, I pay for everything I’m proposing,” Clinton said. “I do not add a penny to the national debt. I take that very seriously, because I do think it’s one of the issues we’ve got to come to grips with.”

This is yet another claim that warrants a laugh-track. The Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget (CRFB) assessed Clinton’s spending tax and spending proposals, concluding that “debt held by the public would rise from $14 trillion to $23.9 trillion over the next decade” and “gross national debt would rise from $19 trillion to more than $29 trillion” under Clinton’s plans, according to Reason.

Hillary claimed that the Clinton Foundation has the best rating from charity watchdogs. “We have the highest rating from the watchdogs that follow foundations,” Clinton said.

But as the Daily Wire‘s Robert Kraychik has previously reported, Charity Navigator didn’t give the Clinton Foundation a rating because it has an “atypical business model,” and the watchdog “GiveWell does not list the Clinton Foundation within its list of top charities.”

You can check out the rest of the lies here and I suggest you do.

Hillary Clinton can’t be trusted.

She proved that at the State Dept., she proved it as a senator, and she is proving it as a candidate.

Watch this video and try not to jump out of a window. Just think about that for a second. Even if this guy is wildly off and he’s off on the real number by 3 million people.

That’s still a MILLION dead people who could potentially vote in the election if someone wanted to make that happen. How much more of this stuff needs to come out before liberals finally admit that showing an ID when you vote might not be the worst idea in the world?"

",http://www.americanthinker.com/articles/2016/10/conservative_correctness_the_back_side_of_the_political_correctness_coin.html,28,"Donald Trump has irrevocably toppled the elite's apple cart, causing those who might be described as high-profile, highly respected ""Buckley conservatives"" – i.e., those who have overseen and orchestrated so many cultural and political losses over the last couple of decades – to unwittingly adopt the tactics of the ultra-liberal left.

In so doing, they seek to cause others to suppress free inquiry as they shame them into re-channeling their behaviors in line with their own.

Those who have always seemed to champion intellectual curiosity and free discussion now act to stifle both as they engage in forms of name-calling, finger-wagging, and conscience-shaming.

This is nothing more than political correctness under the guise of conservatism.  Let's call it ""conservative correctness."" 

Name-Calling and Threats

Some leading social conservatives have warned compatriots who support Donald Trump that they are now Besmirched and Tainted.  They have Betrayed their comrades.  They are not serious religious conservatives; They are hacks and heretics.

Over the years, I have stood shoulder to shoulder with many of these folks as we have fought in Washington, D.C. and around the country to protect the definition of marriage.  During that time, I never once heard an unkind word uttered about opponents on the other side of the issue.  It seems that vituperation, passive aggression, and shaming have been reserved for close allies. 

Alinsky's Rules for Conservatives

Here are four of Saul Alinsky's twelve rules for radicals that might prove illuminating for Buckley conservatives:

Rule #1.  [T]he mass of our people ... must feel so frustrated, so defeated, so lost, so futureless in the prevailing system that they are willing to let go of the past and chance the future.

In recent years, many conservatives misread the mood of the country because so many among their leadership are sheltered in their comfortable enclaves in Washington, D.C.; Manhattan; and a few Ivy League universities.  They have been in no position to sense the shift, nor have they felt the need to pay attention to the Country Class and adjust their message.  Donald Trump has understood this from the start and has capitalized on it.

Rule #2.  A reformation means that masses of our people have reached the point of disillusionment with past ways and values. They don't know what will work but they do know that the prevailing system is self-defeating, frustrating, and hopeless[.] ... The time is then ripe for revolution.

This is a perfect description of our country today.  Many feel, as both Donald Trump and Bernie Saunders have suggested, that ""the system is rigged.""  The system seems to favor immigrants, sexual minorities, and the investing classes, but not them.

When the Tea Party crashed upon the scene, one of its three foundational principles was free trade.  That message no longer resonates.  In many regions of the country, folks have concluded that free trade is precisely what has killed their jobs and decimated their communities and families.  Pure conservative ideology neither puts food on the table nor keeps futureless, moribund kids off drugs.

Rule #3.  As an organizer I start from where the world is, as it is, not as I would like it to be. That we accept the world as it is does not in any sense weaken our desire to change it into what we believe it should be – it is necessary to begin where the world is if we are going to change it to what we think it should be. 

This is key.  Buckley conservatives now appear desperate to maintain a status quo that no longer exists, except in their own minds.  Tellingly, Republican candidate Trump represents a supreme existential threat, while Democrat candidate Clinton is merely an opponent.  

To the public they portray themselves as having their consciences tied up in knots.  They are unable to bring themselves either to support or to vote for Donald Trump because to do so would be to betray the purity of their souls.  If you ask me, that dog don't hunt.

The fact is, they are not constrained by conscience; they are constrained by political and financial calculus.  These are the same folks who have overseen one political and cultural loss after another while receiving acclaim and longstanding lucrative positions.  The left is not a threat to them.  On the contrary, fear-mongering is a wonderful source of fundraising.  The rise of Donald Trump, on the other hand, and the millions who back his candidacy are unmanageable forces that threaten to end their dominance on the political-cultural stage.

There's a reason the right has lost so many battles over the years.  And now Trump's ""impure conservative"" message is winning while the pure ideological message and attraction of Buckley conservatism has faded.  The Buckley conservatives didn't present their message in a convincing or attractive way.  They failed to make it relevant.  The left has done a better job of messaging, and now Donald Trump is doing the same.

Rule #9.  There can be no darker or more devastating tragedy than the death of man's faith in himself and in his power to direct his future.

Ironically, because the conservative intelligentsia failed to sense this occurring in many millions of lives across the country, this has now become their own lot.

Candidate Clinton was skewered for calling Trump supporters a basket of deplorables.  But many Buckley conservatives deliver the same message to their fellow conservatives who support Trump.

The rise of Donald Trump is being presented by Buckley conservatives as a Hobson's choice: either vote for Trump and risk an eternity in hell for committing an unredeemable act or reject Trump on principle and allow the country to go to hell.  What a depressing, no-win proposition!  This choice offers no reasonable alternative for the tens of millions who do not view Donald Trump as the lesser of two evils, but who are in fact thrilled with both the candidate and his platform.

Instead of writing social conservatism's obituary, how about we take a cue from Obama's chief of staff immediately following the 2008 election and the financial crisis?

Never let a serious crisis go to waste ... it's an opportunity to do things you think you could not do before.

I write this not to insult, but to plead for an examination of conscience among many whom I think of as friends, colleagues, and fellow warriors who seek to protect life and human dignity.

100773,1008,How Liberals Use Instigation against Trump,http://www.americanthinker.com/articles/2016/10/how_liberals_use_instigation_against_trump.html,28,"In the past week, GOP presidential candidate Donald Trump has been chastised by the media for being obsessed with the accusations of sexual impropriety alleged by several women.

There are several issues here.  One is that these women are all of a sudden coming out of the woodwork one month before the general election.  One may ask: if they were so injured by Trump's actions, why they didn't go to the newspapers sooner?  If these actions happened 10, 20, or more years ago, why all of a sudden, when Trump is running for president, did their consciences motivate them to report his behavior?  After all, Trump was in the public eye for decades.  They could have given their stories over the 14-year tenure of his TV show, but they didn't.

The other question that arises is, if these stories were so important, and these women didn't have the courage to reveal them until one month before the election, does this mean that if Trump never ran for president, they would never have complained about his behavior?  This indicates a link between these stories and a strategy to discredit Trump's presidential campaign.

There is a more subtle tactic here, a dirty tricks strategy Democrats love to perpetrate: the tactic of creating a controversy or chaotic situation, then blaming the victim – in this case, Donald Trump – for responding to it. 

This is revealed by the way the media describe the situation.  With the Trump touching allegations, there are two steps involved.  One was the printing of the stories in the NYT and, secondly, Trump's reaction at campaign rallies, calling the women who made these allegations ""liars"" and blaming the media for publicizing them one month before the election.

Some of these stories have been discredited.  They have yet to be thoroughly investigated.  But to discuss these details is still to get caught up in the fray.

The nature of the fray, and how the fray was set up by the media, is the most interesting phenomenon: that they are helping Hillary.  Here's the proof: when Trump called these women liars, he was pounced upon by the media for allowing himself to get distracted, for straying away from the focus of his campaign, the important issues of jobs, national security, and the economy.  But if Trump is wrong to bring this distraction, the voter may ask if the NYT and CNN were also wrong to bring these distractions into the election in the first instance.  Should this be thought of as good reporting, another example of the exercise of a double standard, or is there another strategy involved? 

That there may be another strategy was suggested by some clandestine video recordings made by a group called Project Veritas Action.  Members of this group videoed two Democratic Party campaign operatives, Robert Creamer and Scott Foval, and these operatives admitted that the violence at Trump campaign rallies, which was picked up by the media as signs that Trump is instigating racial hatred toward immigrants and minorities, was deliberately staged.  They had people planted at those rallies who would start shouting, pushing, and shoving, creating physical confrontations.  And just by coincidence, there was always someone standing nearby with a video camera, with fully charged batteries and a focused lens, ready to capture the pushing and shoving going on between somebody holding a Trump sign and a Hillary agitator.

DNC operatives admitted to setting up these false scenarios of violence.  These trips were organized by a group called Democracy Partners.  But the mainstream media don't show the videos made by Project Veritas Action.  They do not appear on big media websites. 

So bad behavior was used to set up Trump as the cause of the bad behavior.  This issue then becomes, was the NYT's use of the touching allegations, and the subsequent criticism of Trump's reaction, a similarly set up event?  Did the media intentionally agitate Trump with these touching allegations, then condemn him for responding?  Everyone who watches a football or basketball game sees that occasionally someone pushes another player, then the player pushes back, and the player who pushed back is always tagged for committing a personal foul.

The recent Wikileaks emails prove that the Hillary campaign has been involved in a conspiracy to discredit Trump as well as Bernie Sanders.  And the emails further indicate that there was correspondence between the Hillary campaign and so-called journalists who were involved with the debates.  Someone gave Donna Brazile a heads-up to some questions Hillary would be asked.  So in the areas of physical confrontations at rallies and giving Hillary an advantage at debates, we now know there is evidence of collusion, some of it illegal.

From now on, the media should discuss the initial, instigating action, not Trump's reaction to it.  If they only discuss Trump's reaction, they look like willing participants, just as Hillary's operatives at Trump's rallies were willing participants.

If the media can't sort this out, the voters will have to sort it out for themselves.  Voters now have a right to be suspicious about the allegations of violence at Trump rallies, since there never was violence at a Hillary rally or a Bernie Sanders rally – only at Trump rallies.  And now there is proof that the violence at Trump rallies was set up by Hillary operatives.

It will be interesting to see if from now on, the media say that the NYT and CNN are dragging the campaign into the dirt, taking the low road, by putting touching and other personal  allegations into the headlines.  But they won't.  This proves they are part of it.  They won't even discuss this as a possibility; they don't want voters to give a critical look to the touching allegations.  They don't want to smarten them up.  If they don't report this viewpoint, that they are responsible for this lowball campaign strategy, it proves they are part of it.  They don't want to give up their tactic.  It's a form of a scam, a con.  And one rule of the con artists is never to give up the con. 

It will be very interesting if Trump and Melania sue the NYT, to see if their lawyers get hold of emails between the NYT and the Hillary campaign.  During a court case, each side has the right  to force the other, through discovery, to turn over all available documents, including cell phone records and emails. 

Eighty years ago, the media and big politicians had a ""gentlemen's agreement"" not to discuss personal behavior.  The liberal writer David Halberstam documented this.  Now they not only report on it, but create it out of thin air, to support only one party.

100774,1008,Hillary Clinton: America's Most Dangerous Enemy Within,http://www.americanthinker.com/articles/2016/10/hillary_clinton_americas_most_dangerous_enemy_within.html,28,"From Florida, I flew out to Reno to entertain at the 2016 Nevada Women's Expo. In between my shows, I made pit-stops in my hotel room. Folks, I could hardly believe what I was seeing. Every news TV channel I turned to was beating the crap out of Trump trying to brand him an abuser of women. Leaked Hillary emails have revealed that the mainstream media gets its marching orders from the Clinton campaign. 

Thus, the media fix is in: portray Trump in a red hoodie with a pitchfork; portray wicked-crooked Hillary as angelic, wearing a pure white flowing gown. Never have I seen such a shock-and-awe orchestrated media campaign to demonize a candidate.

On the issue of “abuse of women”, if we had a fair and balanced mainstream media rather than operatives of the Clinton campaign, Hillary's advisers would have begged her, “Pleeeeease Ma'am, don't go there!!!” Hillary and Bill's records of abusing women is horrific (assault, rape, Hillary humiliating a 12- year-old girl to get her rapist off and more). And yet, the Clintons arrogantly know they can get away with attempting to brand Trump an abuser of women while they belong in the Infamous Abusers of Women Hall of Shame.

Folks, it is beyond repulsive and stomach turning watching our Leftist enemies deceptively promoting this evil woman as an angel of light.

During the extremely rough flight into Reno for the Women's Expo (my wife Mary's nails pressed firmly into my thigh), I watched a DVD of Trevor Loudon's extremely scary, compelling and yet hopeful new movie, Enemies Within.

Trevor's movie brings home the reality that Communism and Sharia Law could become the law of the land in America. I realize that sounds “far-out”, as we said in the 70s. However, Trevor gives documented evidence to prove his point.

Enemies Within zooms in on the best-kept secret of modern politics. Almost no one is aware of the fact that fewer than 20,000 U.S. Communists, socialists and extreme “progressives” are able to influence the politicians and even write the laws that control the lives of over 300 million Americans.”

Enemies Within features shocking testimony from an awarded Homeland Security agent who was humiliated and punished by our government for doing his job, collecting data on Islamic terrorists operating in the United States. The agent's data was removed from the system. The agent was investigated and deemed more of a threat to national security than the terrorists.

Trevor's movie names numerous U.S. congressmen who are colluding with foreign and domestic enemies.

As said in the Twilight Zone movie, “Wanna see something really scary?” Hillary Clinton could not pass an FBI security check because of her overt ties to organizations with known associations with terrorism. That should scare your socks off, folks.

Trevor exposes a long list of high-ranking democrats who are in bed with American communists working to elect as many far-left Democrats as possible. The movie documents Obama's communist roots. I remember pundits in both parties having a cow over Victoria Jackson's song, “There's A Communist Living in the White House.”

Watching the movie, I was moved by comments from U.S. Navy Admiral, retired, James “Ace” Lyons. “Never in my lifetime did I believe I would witness this great country of ours being withdrawn from our world leadership role; and taken down by our own administration.”

Obama, with Hillary's blessing, has decimated our military; the smallest army prior to WWII; the smallest navy since prior to WWI. The Chinese are building 60 ships a year. We are building 9-10 ships per year. We have 1700 nuclear weapons in the overall nuclear balance verses the Russians' 4500. Our tactical nuclear weapons are obsolete. Russia's tactical nuclear weapons are new.

Enemies Within caught Hillary on video vowing to go further than Obama's implementation of illegal immigration. To gain a permanent progressive majority, Democrats need more voters. They need illegals. Our enemies within lie that there are 11 million illegals. The truth is there are 20 to 50 million. If the Dems can legalize 10, 20, 30 million illegals and give them voting rights, the majority will vote Democratic. It would mean game over for our two-party system, the end of America as founded.

Bottom line -- we cannot allow our enemies within to succeed in putting Hillary Clinton in the White House. The Democratic party platform touts communism hidden under a shroud of more palatable names. Yes. Yes. Yes, we can!

The good news is Trevor's movie, Enemies Within, offers solutions. Folks, find out how you can stop our enemies’ evil takeover. Please visit EnemiesWithinMovie.com

100775,1009,REPUBLICANS SHOULD NOT “ACCEPT” HILLARY CLINTON’S SUPREME COURT NOMINEES,http://www.powerlineblog.com/archives/2016/10/republicans-should-not-accept-hillary-clintons-supreme-court-nominees.php,28,"When Hillary Clinton nominates a Supreme Court Justice to replace Antonin Scalia (assuming Merrick Garland is not confirmed before Clinton takes office), that nominee will testify before the Senate Judiciary Committee that he or she will uphold the Constitution impartially and decide cases based on the law, not his or her policy preferences or the status of the litigants. That nominee will be lying.

This is clear from what Clinton said last night about the Supreme Court and the kind of Justice she will nominate. Here is how Clinton answered Chris Wallace’s opening question regarding her view of how the Constitution should be interpreted:

You know, I think when we talk about the Supreme Court, it really raises the central issue in this election, namely, what kind of country are we going to be? What kind of opportunities will we provide for our citizens? What kind of rights will Americans have?

And I feel strongly that the Supreme Court needs to stand on the side of the American people, not on the side of the powerful corporations and the wealthy. For me, that means that we need a Supreme Court that will stand up on behalf of women’s rights, on behalf of the rights of the LGBT community, that will stand up and say no to Citizens United, a decision that has undermined the election system in our country because of the way it permits dark, unaccountable money to come into our electoral system.

Clinton never mentioned the Constitution. She never so much as nodded at it.

Clinton’s answer shows that she thinks interpreting the Constitution means “standing up on behalf of women’s rights” and “on behalf of the rights of the LGBT community.” It also means ignoring the rights of “powerful corporations and the wealthy.”

In other words, cases should be decided based (at least in part, though Clinton never qualified her answer this way) on the gender, sexual preference, or wealth of the litigants, not on what the Constitution or applicable statute provides. The Constitution, in her view, is not a set of rules that applies equally to everyone, but rather a means of favoring members of groups that appeal to Hillary Clinton.

Here, though, is the oath taken by Supreme Court Justices:

I, _________, do solemnly swear (or affirm) that I will administer justice without respect to persons, and do equal right to the poor and to the rich, and that I will faithfully and impartially discharge and perform all the duties incumbent upon me as _________ under the Constitution and laws of the United States.

(Emphasis added).

Hillary Clinton has effectively promised to nominate Justices who will not uphold that oath.

For Republicans, and anyone else who believes in the Constitution and the rule of law, such Justices are not acceptable and cannot be confirmed. When a Clinton nominee testifies that he or she will uphold the oath, Senators ought not believe the testimony. God knows, Clinton has her flaws but they do not include an inability (with the help of her apparatchiks) to identify lawyers and judges who will uphold her anti-constitutional vision of the Supreme Court.

However the Senate races turn out, Republicans will have the votes to block Clinton Supreme Court nominees under the current rules. Unfortunately, if the Democrats control the Senate, they will change the rules as necessary to confirm Clinton’s nominees. In any case, I can’t imagine Republicans holding firm enough to block Clinton’s nominees indefinitely.

So when Clinton appointed Justices cast decisive votes, conservatives must denounce the decisions not just as wrongly decided, but as illegitimate. We should “accept” the decisions in the sense of abiding by the results, but we should not accept them as legitimate interpretations of the Constitution or the applicable statute.

We should attack the Court non-stop as illegitimate, the way conservatives used to do in the days of the Warren Court. Driving through the south in those days, I sued to see “impeach Earl Warren” signs. If worse comes to worst, I would like to see “impeach Goodwin Liu” (or whomever) signs.

The Hillary Clinton Court is likely to overreach in ways even the Warren Court never did. Its leftist decisions will become a major political issue. In advancing that issue, it will be important for conservatives to throw Clinton’s manifesto of last night in her face as the basis for arguing that the Supreme Court is acting illegitimately, not just misguidedly."
100776,1009,"NOT RIGGED, THROWN",http://www.powerlineblog.com/archives/2016/10/not-rigged-thrown.php,28,"Donald Trump’s allegations that the election is “rigged” constitute a motif in the closing days of his presidential campaign. The theme emerged last night in his refusal to acknowledge he would concede the election when he loses.

I find Trump’s allegation of the rigging of the election bizarre. It advertises his understanding that he will lose the election. He disclaims responsibility for the loss in advance, but there it is, even if his enthusiasts fail to understand what he is saying.

Why would Trump advertise his loss in advance? He wants us to know that it’s not his fault. It couldn’t be helped. It’s beyond his control. When he loses an eminently winnable race to the most beatable Democratic candidate of the modern era, so he believes, it won’t be because of his failures as a candidate.

It certainly seems to be beyond his control to get a handle on the personality defects that have manifested themselves within 30 minutes or so of his debates with Clinton. If he prepared at all for these showdowns, it barely showed. It makes more sense to infer that Trump is throwing the election than to assert that it is rigged.

Hillary Clinton is a sinister character but an utterly pathetic candidate. To anyone paying attention, her manifest flaws, weaknesses and wrongdoing made themselves apparent one way or another last night. The evidence continues to mount every day. A modestly capable candidate could make hash of her.

Trump is not the man. He can barely frame a coherent thought or articulate a comprehensible argument against her.

The great theme of Trump’s campaign in one way or another is American sovereignty. If Trump did more than pretend to care about it, he would master an argument and discipline himself. He would take the trouble to select the strongest points to be made against a profoundly flawed opponent and learn how to make them.

Understanding that he is going to lose “big league,” as he would say, to a pitifully weak opponent, he is more concerned about salvaging his pride than putting up a fight. As I say, I think it makes more sense to infer that he is throwing the contest than that the election is rigged (not that the latter makes much sense at all)."
100777,1009,"NOT RIGGED, THROWN: BILL CAMPENNI COMMENTS",http://www.powerlineblog.com/archives/2016/10/not-rigged-thrown-bill-campenni-comments.php,28,"William Campenni served in the Texas Air National Guard with George W. Bush. We got to know him in connection with Rathergate. He is an eloquent and knowledgeable commenter on politics and public affairs, as in his Amereican Thinker column “Nothing in common.” Bill writes to take issuue with my post this morning, though I think his comments complement what I had to say. Bill writes:

Let me tell you a story before I get to the “accepting the results” minutiae that have been elevated to a national crisis.

Some years ago I was doing classified work. So classified that I could only read the papers in a locked, secured, and watched vault.

While going through one document regarding SIOPs (Single Integrated Operating Plan – the checklist for nuclear war, used until 2003), I noticed it was marked Top Secret (TS) overall, but most of the paragraphs were marked Secret (S).

But for one, the obvious details and contents of which I still cannot discuss.

You know what that paragraph was about? Not throw weights of nuclear missiles, or thermal signature of boost vehicles, or target coordinates.

Nope. It was about presidential response times once a nuclear strike was being detected. Like how long it would take to get the president out of the bathroom taking a crap or shower, or out of the presidential limo when out at a banquet, or from the bedroom to the communications room to initiate a counterstrike. It was marked Top Secret. TOP SECRET!

So I was floored last night when I heard Hillary Clinton come out with the “four minutes to react” comment.

I won’t confirm the accuracy of that number, or even the context she was referring to, but that was TOP SECRET information.

If we ever had the time and opportunity I would take you through a discussion of the OODA loop, a tool we in the military use to get inside an enemy’s decision cycle. What Clinton revealed last night was a clue for an enemy to know what is one of the most critical parameters of OUR OODA loop.

But what are the media, the punditry, the politicos, and unfortunately PowerLine talking about today? Donald Trump’s valid complaint that he can’t make any acceptance of election results when the threat of fraud has never been greater.

Even in your own Minnesota you have a sitting senator placed there by voting fraud.

For years here in Virginia I have observed massive fraud – in the registration process, in the absentee ballot casting, in the battle to remove photo IDs, in the voting at the polls. Recent studies have shown thousands of illegal alien registrations in Virginia, and hundreds of voters also casting votes in other states (college kids the worst offenders). My own identity (SS No.) was stolen last year and used to get a fraudulent tax refund and voting. I have written in the past about the massive fraud here with illegal alien voting. For over a decade the SEIU and its local affiliates have gone through the extensive illegal alien community here in Virginia fraudulently registering illegals who then vote in large numbers, usually in early voting or absentee ballots, because there are no poll watchers to challenge them. They even brag about it.

In 2006, George Allen was beaten by illegal alien vote margins, giving the Senate to the Democrats. Terry McAuliffe is governor because of a narrow margin granted him by illegal alien voting – and a Trump-like NeverCuccinelli movement by establishment Republicans (sound familiar? National Review? Power Line?). We lost two consecutive Attorney General elections by several hundred votes, with illegal aliens the difference. Warner defeated Gillespie for Senate in 2014 by a small vote difference provided by illegals. And my friend the local former Fairfax County Democrat head brags about it when we have coffee together.

So why should Trump say that he will blindly accept the results when Virginia fraud is multiplied 51 times across the country? When Podesta talks about getting illegal aliens to vote with drivers licenses? When Project Veritas shows gloating Democrat operatives talking about registering illegals?

100778,1010,Donald Trump spews incorrect facts about late-term abortion during final debate,https://thinkprogress.org/trump-debate-roe-wade-290089ed4734#.xnexjpkxn,28,"Twenty minutes into the final presidential debate between Donald Trump and Hillary Clinton, the Republican candidate argued that a Clinton presidency would lead to babies being “ripped” from their mothers’ bodies during late-term abortions.
The factually-incorrect statement was a response to host Chris Wallace’s question about late term abortions. Trump claimed that Clinton supports babies being torn from the womb at the last possible minute.
“If you go with what Hillary is saying, in the ninth month you can take the baby and rip the baby out of the womb of the mother, just prior to the birth of the baby,” he told Wallace. “But it’s not okay with me, because based on what she is saying and based on where she’s going and where she’s been, you can take the baby and rip the baby out of the womb, in the ninth month, on the final day. That’s not acceptable.”Clinton responded that the government should not control women’s bodies, and explained that the decision to terminate a pregnancy at a later stage of a pregnancy is not one made lightly.
“This is one of the worst possible choices that any woman and her family has to make,” she said. “And I do not believe the government should be making it.”
The national debate about the amount of time women should be allowed to obtain abortions is one that’s largely driven by the concept of “partial birth abortion”_—_a term that is strictly political, as opposed to one based on medical practice. Nonetheless, the Supreme Court outlawed so-called “partial birth abortion” nearly a decade ago.
Trump’s response evokes violent, graphic images of babies dragged from the womb, kicking and screaming, which is a common tactic. The pro-life community has long used the term “partial birth”_—_and, more recently, “dismemberment”_—_to garner support.
In fact, that graphic “dismemberment” language typically refers to a standard abortion procedure performed after the first 12 weeks of a pregnancy, which involves dilating a woman’s cervix to extract fetal tissue. The official term for this method is Dilatation and Evacuation_—_a procedure that’s widely accepted in the global health community, including among researchers with the World Health Organization (WHO)."
100779,1010,Donald Trump’s disregard for teachers,https://thinkprogress.org/donald-trumps-disregard-for-teachers-9ff7901986f9#.b2vn0qeig,28,"In a 1997 legal deposition, Donald Trump argued that educators lack intelligence, saying that teachers are “very stupid.”
Trump’s attack on educators, which came to light in a recent examination of his views on education, come as the Republican nominee is still reeling from the fallout from his previous remarks, many of which have been decried as sexist, racist, or simply intolerant.
Trump’s comments about teachers first appeared in a decades-old Los Angeles Times article and have not been reported upon since. At the time, Trump sued the Los Angeles School Board to obtain development rights to a piece of land in downtown Los Angeles.
During the deposition in Los Angeles, Trump said: “I assumed that the people essentially teaching the kids were not stupid. They turned out to be very stupid.” He also assailed the school board, describing the members as “fools,” and complained about the city, saying that the development rights were taken from him “as viciously as in Nazi Germany.”
These comments fit into a long-standing pattern of anti-teacher rhetoric from the Republican nominee.
Trump’s writings show that he has long viewed teachers as a type of societal punching bag. In at least one instance, Trump bragged about literally assaulting an educator, and in his 1987 book, Art of the Deal, Trump boasted about hitting his grade-school music teacher for not “knowing anything about music.”
In his book The America We Deserve, Trump goes further, blaming teachers unions for America’s education ills, arguing that the organizations are nothing more than self-interested monopolies that harm education with their anti-choice agenda.
Trump’s anti-teacher views are also reflected in his recent policy statements. On the campaign trail, Trump often promotes dismantling the nation’s public education system, which would result in significant educator job loss. Trump has also repeatedly called for the elimination of the Department of Education, which would spark the loss of almost half a million teacher jobs.
Some of Trump’s closest advisers have advocated similar views. New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie (R), for example, once said that teachers unions “deserve a punch in the face.” Trump’s son, Donald Trump, Jr. has also attacked teachers, criticizing the Democratic Party for being “more concerned about protecting the jobs of tenured teachers than serving the students in desperate need of a good education.” In that same speech, Trump Jr. also implied teachers were only in the profession for their own self-serving agenda.
The approach of the Trump campaign standards in marked contrast to Hillary Clinton’s approach. In recent remarks, the Democratic presidential hopeful has proposed a campaign to “elevate” the teaching profession.
“One of my main goals as president will be to launch a national campaign to modernize and elevate the profession of teaching,” Clinton said. “To reach out to encourage more talented young people to become teachers. To reach out and encourage more talented mid-career professionals to do the same.”
As for the teacher who Trump allegedly gave a black eye, the educator appeared to have the last word: near his death, the teacher told his family that “when that kid [Trump] was 10, even then he was a little shit.”"
100780,1010,The most frightening lie of the last presidential debate,https://thinkprogress.org/trump-election-rigging-2d9b16b91888#.khqq2tavw,28,"As Trump’s poll numbers have sagged in recent weeks, he has taken to claiming that the election is “rigged” against him. He reiterated this claim at the third debate, citing a litany of reasons that he will “keep you in suspense” about whether he’ll accept the results of the elections.
While some of this complaint has to do with his belief that the media has been mean to him it its coverage, some of it relies on widely-debunked claims of “large scale voter fraud.” Study after study has found that voter fraud_—_especially impersonation of other voters_—_is virtually non-existent in U.S. elections; you are more likely to be struck by lightning or report seeing a UFO than to commit such fraud.
The specter of voter fraud is often raised by Republicans eager to depress Democratic voter turnout as an excuse to enact strict voter suppression laws, such as strict voter ID requirements. But that does not make it real and the laws would do little to stop it even if it were.
In recent days, Trump has urged his supporters to flood into heavily Democratic cities of Chicago, Philadelphia, and St. Louis_—_cities with significant minority populations_—_and “watch.” Voting rights advocates have warned this could lead to illegal voter intimidation or suppression.
Trump’s suggestion of a conspiracy to rig the election against him in particular, of course, is especially unlikely. A ThinkProgress review of chief state elections officials found that 29 states, representing 302 electoral votes, have GOP-controlled election processes and another four (representing 63 electoral votes) are overseen by bipartisan boards. Several Republican election officials have pushed back against Trump’s rigging claims and even his campaign manager conceded on Wednesday that she does “not believe there will be widespread voter fraud” on Election Day.
Hillary Clinton noted that Trump frequently claims anything he loses is rigged against him, including even the Emmy Awards."
100781,1001,"The RNC begs voters: don't listen to Trump, don't become polling place vigilantes",http://www.dailykos.com/stories/2016/10/21/1585286/-The-RNC-begs-voters-don-t-listen-to-Trump-don-t-become-polling-place-vigilantes,29,"Donald Trump has been calling on his followers to monitor polling stations.

Warning darkly of a stolen election, Donald J. Trump has called on supporters to turn out in droves on Election Day to monitor polling places, telling them they need to be vigilant against widespread voter fraud and a rigged outcome.
The call has turned into Trump supporters #CodeRed where red-wearing Trumpistas plan to surround polling places to intimidate voters and also enter them as “observers.” Trump is especially encouraging his red shirts to go into minority districts …

“Voter fraud is all too common, and then they criticize us for saying that,” he said at a rally Tuesday in Colorado Springs. “But take a look at Philadelphia, what’s been going on, take a look at Chicago, take a look at St. Louis. Take a look at some of these cities, where you see things happening that are horrendous.”
Though it’s unclear if any of his supporters are willing to bring their bigotry and racism to places where someone might … object. 

While Donald Trump is constantly expounding on nonexistent voter fraud, the RNC has begun desperately calling on Republicans not to go through with it because there’s a deal in place that could be broken if Trump voters actually turn up to challenge voters, and overly zealous actions from Trump’s goon squads could end up costing Republicans more than just this election.

The Election Protection Coalition is mobilizing thousands of volunteers to help Americans navigate the voting process—overcoming difficult roadblocks and dangerous conservative voter suppression tactics. Sign up today to help make sure all Americans have a chance to vote.

The idea that Trump is heavily hinting at—having poll watchers go into polling places and challenge so many voters that the whole polling station essentially comes to a standstill—isn’t new.  In particular, Republicans have used “voter caging” to generate ready lists of voters to justify challenges. Republicans leaned on this scheme several times. Finally, in the 1981 New Jersey governor’s race, the Republican Party’s actions were so blatant and widespread, that Democrats took them to court.

According to the Dems' lawsuit, the RNC and its state counterpart engaged in a number of practices in the name of “ballot security” that intimidated, threatened or coerced minority voters. The alleged activities included the hiring of off-duty cops to patrol near polling places in minority communities, as well as a shady mailer campaign the RNC used to cobble together a list to challenge otherwise eligible voters from casting ballots at polling places. 
Democrats won the case, and ever since the Republican Party has been under a consent decree that limits the number of poll watchers and how vigorously they can use voter challenges. Republicans have been fighting to get this decree lifted, but lost the case right up to the Supreme Court. If Republicans make it through this election without breaking this consent, the whole agreement expires next year. But if not, it could be re-instituted, or even made tougher.

Technically, the decree only applies to actions of the Republican Party, not those of a specific candidate. But it’s hard to argue that Trump’s campaign and RNC actions are not heavily intertwined at this point, especially with party chair Reince Priebus a regular part of Trump’s traveling entourage. 

Last night MSNBC reported that the Trump campaign was hoping to work with the RNC to be on the lookout for (phantom) voter fraud, leading Republican attorney Ben Ginsberg to warn that this could put the RNC into hot water.
If RNC members themselves engage in these activities, it will be a clear breach of the agreement. But even if Trump’s red-wearing brigade follows through on what the dear leader has been advising, that might also constitute a breach.

Does Trump count as the RNC’s agent in these circumstances?  They are certainly acting in concert, and it is plausible to argue that Trump and the RNC are agents of each other for purposes of this election.
If the RNC is found in violation, the decree could be extended by eight years. Of course, people have previously bragged about doing exactly what caused the decree in the first place without apparent penalty."
100782,1001,Reince Priebus is still in the denial stage of grief over how terrible his candidate is,http://www.dailykos.com/stories/2016/10/21/1585295/-Reince-Priebus-is-still-in-the-denial-stage-of-grief-over-how-terrible-his-candidate-is,29,"Donald Trump’s refusal to say he’d accept the results of the election has created an emergency for Republicans, and they’re having a little trouble finding a unified response. Some, especially incumbents in tight races, are distancing themselves. Others, like party leaders Paul Ryan and Mitch McConnell, are refusing to comment. And still others are insisting there’s nothing to see here:

“All he’s saying is, ‘Look, I’m not going to forgo my right to a recount in a close election,’_” [RNC Chair Reince] Priebus said. “We accept the results as long as we’re not talking about a few votes where it actually matters. I know him. I know where his head’s at. ._._. I promise you, that’s all this is.”
I don’t think that’s a promise you can make, Reince. This is not someone whose behavior you’ve had a whole lot of luck predicting or influencing to this point, so why would it be any different when he’s branded as a giant loser in front of the entire world? Rudy Giuliani has seemed a lot more in tune with Trump in recent weeks than has Priebus, and he ...

… argued that any Republican would be “stupid” to accept the integrity of results before they are known.

“Suppose she wins Pennsylvania by 50 votes,” Giuliani said. He speculated, without evidence, that Democrats would “steal a lot more than 50 votes in Philadelphia. I guarantee you of that. And I’ll tell you how they will do it — they’ll bus people in who will vote dead people’s names four, five, six times ._._. or have people in Philadelphia paid to vote three, four and five times.”
Want to reach millennial voters in swing states to win this election? No matter where you live, volunteer with NextGen Climate to make phone calls, texts and other ways to help out.

That’s a giant red herring, of course, because if anyone wins Pennsylvania by 50 votes, there will be a recount. And because, if current polling is anywhere near accurate, Pennsylvania’s electoral votes will not be the difference between winning and losing the presidential race. No, it’s another attempt to sow doubt, to keep Trump supporters ready to feel cheated by lying, cheating black people.

Even if Trump was saying what Priebus claims he’s saying, it would be a gross violation of political norms. But he’s not. This is all about Donald Trump’s fragile ego and his inability to accept that he might be beaten by a woman on the strength of votes, by people whose votes he doesn’t consider to be fully valid. And it’s going to be ugly, especially if Republicans like Priebus and Ryan and McConnell are too afraid to say there’s something wrong with Trump’s position ahead of time. Priebus needs to stop denying the reality everyone can see and deal with the candidate he has, not the candidate he’d like to pretend he has."
100783,1001,President Obama: Trump 'doing the work of our adversaries for them',http://www.dailykos.com/stories/2016/10/20/1585101/-President-Obama-Trump-doing-the-work-of-our-adversaries-for-them,29,"President Obama campaigned for Hillary Clinton today in Miami, Florida, and, boy, did he deliver. In an relaxed, upbeat, and funny speech, Obama rallied an exuberant audience of Florida voters.

He told the audience ""we got to do it big, we got to leave no doubt,"" because ""the Donald is already whining that the vote's going to be rigged before the game is even over."" And he joked that ""this is just about him worried that he's losing."" But then he gets serious, very serious.

This is more than just the usual standard lie. Because when you suggest rigging or fraud without a shred of evidence, when last night at the debate, Trump becomes the first major party nominee in American history to suggest that he will not concede despite losing the vote and then says today that he will accept the vote if he wins, that is not a joking manner. 
I want everyone to pay attention here. That is dangerous. Because when you try to sow the seeds of doubt in people's minds about the legitimacy of our election, that undermines our democracy. Then you're doing the work of our adversaries for them. Because our democracy depends on people knowing that their vote matters. That those who occupy the seats of power were chosen by the people. Even when your preferred candidate loses, even when you are the one who is running and you lose, you've got to see the bigger picture and say that here in America, we believe in democracy and we accept the will of the people.
You can watch below. After last night's soul-crushing display from Trump, and his astounding display today, Obama's speech was a perfect antidote. But it had a critical message. What Donald Trump is doing is dangerous, and he has to be defeated so soundly it'll make his head spin.

Can you chip in $3 to help Hillary Clinton keep Donald Trump out of the White House?

100784,1002,"FEC Complaint Filed Against Clinton Campaign, DNC",http://www.breitbart.com/2016-presidential-race/2016/10/21/fec-complaint-filed-clinton-campaign-dnc/,29,"WASHINGTON—In the aftermath of James O’Keefe’s videos showing Democratic operatives bragging about breaking the law and inciting violence at Donald Trump events, on Tuesday, a watchdog group filed a formal complaint against Hillary Clinton’s campaign and the Democratic National Committee (DNC), alleging that Clinton’s campaign violated federal election law.
The Public Interest Legal Foundation (PILF) is an Indiana-based law firm that litigates ballot-box integrity lawsuits. PILF filed its complaint with the Federal Election Commission (FEC), arguing that agents from the Democracy Partners and the Foval Group—the persons caught on O’Keefe’s explosive videos—“have engaged in public communications, campaign activity, targeted voter registration drives, and other targeted [get out the vote] activity … at the request, direction, and approval of” Hillary for America (the official name of the Clinton campaign) and the DNC.

Federal law at 52 U.S.C. § 30109(a)(2) provides that once the FEC receives a complaint, “If the Commission … has reason to believe that a person has committed, or is about to commit, a violation of [the Federal Election Campaign Act of 1971—as amended by later statutes,]” the FEC “shall make an investigation of such alleged violation.”

The word “shall” is important because it is mandatory, rather than leaving the FEC the option of taking action. Consequently, when the FEC receives a complaint that is plausible on its face and has any sort of supporting evidence or corroboration—such as, for example, a video of a political operative who says he is taking orders directly from specific persons from the Clinton campaign and the national Democratic Party—federal law requires the FEC to open an investigation.

These videos fit a larger pattern of evidence of voter fraud and illegal election activity. In Virginia, a survey of only eight counties revealed hundreds of foreigners—potentially including illegal aliens—already registered to vote, which is a major focus on PILF’s litigation nationwide.

“American voter rolls are corrupted with unacceptable numbers of aliens who are illegally registered to vote,” PILF President J. Christian Adams said in a statement. “Groups should not be coordinating with campaigns and political parties to exploit vulnerabilities in our election system.”

“We hope this matter is fully investigated by the FEC and that if aliens are voting, they are prosecuted by the Justice Department,” he added. “That would mark a change in DOJ policies of the past seven years.”

Unfortunately for Trump supporters, the FEC is not required to finish an investigation and take legal enforcement action by November 8. But this legal complaint—like a second complaint later filed by O’Keefe himself—fuels media attention on the disturbingly brazen statements caught on the videos. These statements in turn advance Donald Trump’s narrative about the lawlessness and corruption of Hillary Clinton and her activities, going beyond her campaign organization to include the Clinton Foundation and pay-for-play politics."
100785,1002,Dr. Sebastian Gorka: Hillary Clinton’s Disclosure of Nuclear Response Times During Debate Was ‘Unconscionable’,http://www.breitbart.com/radio/2016/10/21/gorka-hillary-clintons-disclosure-nuclear-response-times-debate-unconscionable/,29,"On Friday’s Breitbart News Daily, Breitbart News National Security editor Dr. Sebastian Gorka, author of the best-selling book Defeating Jihad: The Winnable War, talked about Donald Trump and Hillary Clinton’s clash over Russia at the third presidential debate.
“As I’ve said repeatedly, if there is anybody who’s been in the pocket of Vladimir Putin, it is Hillary Clinton. Everybody needs to have out there, the millennials that they know, their nephews, their nieces, just watch Clinton Cash on YouTube,” Gorka said. “The fact that 20 percent of our uranium was sold to Kremlin front companies, in a deal that was signed off by Hillary Clinton as secretary of state, means if there’s anybody who can be bought by the Kremlin, it’s Hillary Clinton.”

“That happened when her husband was receiving $120 million speaking fee from the same companies that bought the uranium,” Gorka noted.

“I have to give great credit to your callers,” he told SiriusXM host Alex Marlow. “Your show is really about the callers. They see through this. They understand that there’s the mainstream media spin, and most often, it is 180 degrees out of phase with reality. If Trump were some kind of puppet for Moscow, wouldn’t this man have casinos in Kaliningrad? Wouldn’t he have giant Trump Towers in Moscow? He doesn’t. That tells you everything you need to know. Reality is completely the reverse of what anybody else inside the mainstream media would have you believe.”

One of those callers joined the conversation at that point to observe that audiences for mainstream media outlets like CNN were given a very different perspective on the debate than people who watched it without such a media filter.

“I think that the real story will be that there is, perhaps, a majority of people out there who simply have had enough,” said Gorka. “Look at the viewing figures for stations like CNN. I think it tells you everything. Look at the figures for Breitbart, the viewers and clicks. I think that’s the hidden story of this election – that the mainstream media believes they still dominate, but I think in two weeks’ time, two-and-a-half weeks’ time, there’s going to be potentially a very big surprise for those people who think they still speak for America and can control what America sees, whether it’s the debates, whether it’s any kind of reporting on any issue, whether it’s the border, or the economy.”

“Just the polls themselves – look at the poll figures, and then look at the Trump rallies,” he suggested. “Again, spin versus reality. Look at the fact that Hillary seems to be leading everywhere, if you listen to the polls, and then just watch the turnout for her campaign events. I think that tells you everything you need to know.”

Gorka was pleased that national security has been such an important theme in the 2016 presidential debates, pausing to issue a disclaimer that he has provided national security advice to Donald Trump in the past, “long before anybody took him seriously.”

“I’m not part of his campaign, but I’ve spoken to this man on more than one occasion about the big issues, such as ISIS, North Korea, Russia, and Iran,” he clarified.

With that disclosure made, Gorka faulted Hillary Clinton, Barack Obama, and their advisers for clumsy handling of major foreign policy issues, agreeing with Donald Trump’s criticism that Clinton and Obama constantly telegraph their moves to the enemy.

“It’s not just Hillary. It’s her coterie. It is the liberal elite. The Obama administration has done exactly the same,” he noted. “Every major deployment in Iraq, every major operation, has been announced in advance, which is anathema to just the most basic principles of warfare. And it’s fascinating. This isn’t a new thing. Her husband did exactly the same thing, during the Balkan wars. Your callers may not recall, but he actually announced before our engagement in the Balkans, he said, ‘I refuse, and I will never put boots on the ground in Yugoslavia.’ Doesn’t that sound familiar? Haven’t you heard somebody else say that, in this current presidential campaign?”

“Telegraphing in advance what you’re going to do is dynamite for the opposition, for your enemy, because then they will prepare to exploit that against you,” Gorka explained. “Look, even after the WikiLeaks became more and more uncomfortable for Hillary, what did we have the vice president do on national television? Announce that, well, they’ve decided Russia is behind all of this, and we’re going to launch a cyber-attack against them, at a time of our choosing. If you read that in a Tom Clancy novel, you’d say, ‘Has Tom lost it?’ Nobody does this.”

“Mr. Trump’s point that he understands we are at war – I can assure your listeners, he knows we are at war, and he wants to win this war, but he’s not going to tell the enemy what we’re going to do. It’s a very, very, valid point,” he said.

Marlow brought up an overlooked moment from the third debate, when Clinton inadvertently revealed some sensitive information about U.S. response times to nuclear attack. Gorka said he wanted to address this issue “in a certain way, if you’ll permit me, as somebody who actually cares for the security of the Republic and who lives in the national security arena.”

From that perspective, he declined to comment on “the veracity, or lack thereof, of what she said.”

“Just one thing has to be drawn, one conclusion has to be drawn: the whole platform of the Hillary campaign, that Mr. Trump is not fit to serve as commander-in-chief, he’s not stable, he can’t be trusted – all of that applies to her, and solely to her,” Gorka said. “Anybody who puts Top Secret/SCI super-classified information on a private homebrew server, and then talks about our nuclear reaction times on live television, in front of tens of millions of people – that woman should not be allowed – I know this is a line Mr. Trump has borrowed from me, but I have to use it – that individual should not be allowed to run for local dog catcher, let alone the most powerful person in the world. It is unconscionable what she did on national television, and the fact the liberal media is giving her heat on that tells you everything you need to know.”

Gorka turned to the chaos currently engulfing two key cities in the Middle East, Iraq’s Mosul and Syria’s Aleppo.

“What we have is this group of – a very heterogenous military force has deployed to Mosul. Again, this was announced weeks in advance by the current administration. We have the Sunni elements of the standing Iraqi army. We have elements of the Kurdish Peshmerga. And, on top of that – this is perhaps the most problematic – we have so-called ‘mobilization forces,’ which are made up Shia former militias, working together, hopefully, to take Mosul with our brave men, and some of our women, as well, as advisers providing training, providing intelligence, and also bombing capabilities for those forces,” Gorka explained.

“The idea is to recapture the second-biggest city in Iraq, which isn’t just important for the size of the city, but because this is the location where, in June 2014, the head of ISIS, Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi, declared formally the re-establishment of the Caliphate, the new empire of Islam,” he noted. “So Mosul is very, very important. The problem with this operation is the very mixed nature of who’s fighting. They have very, very different interests in terms of the future of Iraq.”

“And the biggest problem of all: you can launch an attack to capture a city – but what happens if you capture it?” he asked. “Are you going to stay there? Are the local Sunnis going to allow Shia or Kurds to stay in the region? And what happens when the fighters come back? It’s like squeezing a balloon. You can push the fighters out, but sooner or later, if you haven’t killed all of them, they will be back.”

As for Aleppo, Gorka called it a “tragedy,” saying that “the last five years in Syria are truly a humanitarian disaster.”

“Here again, we have reality, and we have spin,” he said. “The idea that somehow, we’re going to have a cooperative Russia assist us in stopping the killing and bring stability to that nation is a fantasy. The whole Obama administration’s policy is based on an article of faith that is, again, just phantasmagorical – the idea that Assad must go.”

“Whatever the desperate situation in Aleppo, Assad is not going anywhere,” Gorka noted regretfully. “As long as that man enjoys the support not only of Russia, but Iran and even China, this is a head of state that isn’t going anywhere – unless, of course, America wishes to go to war with Russia, China, and Iran, which is not advisable right now.”

“So we have to stabilize the region. We have to realize that only a political resolution is realistic. And unfortunately, the current powers-that-be in Washington simply do not understand that,” he said.

Dr. Gorka’s parting thought was to “reinforce that November the 8th is primarily about one issue, as far as I’m concerned, and I think most Americans agree with me: it’s about which person do you think is going to keep you and your family safe.”

“So when you’re going to the polling booth, and please bring as many people with you as you can, remember it’s a choice between Hillary – Servergate, Benghazi, nuclear launch times – and a man who believes we are at war with the jihadists and wishes to win. It really is quite that simple, Alex,” he said.

100786,1002,"Donald Trump to Lay Out Campaign’s Closing Argument, Plan for First 100 Days of Administration, in Gettysburg",http://www.breitbart.com/2016-presidential-race/2016/10/21/donald-trump-closing-argument-first-100-days-gettysburg/,29,"NEW YORK CITY, New York — Donald J. Trump, the Republican nominee for president, will lay out a specific and detailed vision for the United States of America in a Saturday address that will focus on his closing argument for the campaign and on his first 100 days in office should he win, aides told reporters late Friday night.
The focus, Trump aides told reporters on a conference call, will be on what working-class and middle-class Americans need and want.

The contrast that will set up, they say, is sharp when it comes to Trump’s opponent Democratic nominee Hillary Rodham Clinton: She’s fighting for the special interests, lobbyists, banks, corporations, Wall Street, and globalists, while Trump is fighting for the average American.

The difference between Trump’s vision and Clinton’s, the Trump aides say, will focus on how her support for “top-down, trickle-down globalism” doesn’t help ordinary Americans who are struggling and seeing their wages flatline if they’re lucky enough to still have a job. Clinton, they say, does not care if a job is created here in America or in another country as long as her donors benefit in the end.” Supporters of Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump cheer during a campaign rally, Friday, Oct. 21, 2016, in Newtown, Pa. (AP Photo/ Evan Vucci)

“It’s really going to be fundamentally rooted in the question of do we want a country that has a fundamental loyalty to working people or do we want a country that has a fundamental loyalty to international capital,” one Trump aide told reporters on the conference call in the preview of the Trump speech in Gettysburg. “I think that’s the core question that voters are going to be facing on Nov. 8 and I think that will ultimately prove decisive.”

Other senior Trump aides emphasized the fact that Trump will lay out his agenda for his first 100 days in office in the Gettysburg address on Saturday morning at 11 a.m. ET.

The speech will focus on national security, law and order, job creation, trade policy, ethics reform, regulatory reform, economic stimulation, and more central themes from his campaign. The Trump team says that the campaign has been in contact with congressional and military advisers to Mr. Trump on the matter. “I think you’re going to see, continuing with the same kinds of principles he’s been outlining, you’re going to see some additional policy details on some of those points,” a senior Trump said. “Everything is just consistent with and part of what his vision has been the whole campaign and the core things we think we can get done in the first 100 days.”

The event will be Trump’s fourth in Pennsylvania over two days, as he held three rallies there on Friday. "
100787,1003,Hillary Is Right; Trump’s Comments Are Horrifying,http://www.huffingtonpost.com/peter-d-rosenstein/hillary-is-right-trumps-c_b_12591980.html?utm_hp_ref=politics,29,"Prior to the final debate one had to assume Trump would continue to be nastier and more unhinged than ever. Insane he calling Hillary a ‘Nasty Woman’. Judging by his past behavior it is apparent he can’t help lashing out even if the result is self-destructive. In recent weeks his speeches continue to prove him to be a sleaze with no boundaries.

While this behavior would be considered outrageous and in some ways sad for any human being it is absolutely intolerable in someone who wants to be President. One of the most tragic legacies of the Trump campaign will be trying to put the genie he has unleashed back in the bottle. This genie being the racist, sexist, misogynistic, and homophobic attitudes of too many Americans who have used Trump’s campaign as permission to speak out loud what apparently they have been thinking.

Worse is the impact Trump’s rhetoric has had on some of our children who now think it’s acceptable to emulate his bullying behavior. One example occurred in Indiana when high school students used Trump’s anti-Latino insults against players on a visiting basketball team.

What Trump’s campaign has shown us is how much work we as a nation face to educate our own people to understand the diversity in the United States is a positive thing and a part of what makes us so great.

In the final debate Trump went even further of the rails than anyone could have predicted. While he has been talking on the stump about the election being rigged at the debate he refused to say whether he would honor the result. He tried to turn the entire election into a reality show with this comment, “What I’m saying is that I will tell you at the time. I’ll keep you in suspense. OK?”

Those of us with an understanding of the constitution and democracy know with that comment he has disrespected and called into question the 240 year history of our country, the world’s leading democracy. He even spoke counter to most of his own team. His campaign manager, his vice-presidential running mate and even his daughter had said prior to the debate that he would honor the election result.

Hillary’s immediate response was what every thinking person listening would have said. She said his comment was ‘horrifying’, and it truly was. Trump, in front of the world, undermined our Democracy and suggested actions better suited to a banana republic. People around the world for generations have admired and respected the United States for how we transition from one administration to another, without violence, with courtesy and respect no matter how tough the campaign has been. There is an implicit understanding the health and security of our people and the nation is more important than any one person, one party, or one election. Our country was reminded of this history with a lesson in dignity and respect by a letter George H.W. Bush left for Bill Clinton after losing the election to him in 1992.

Many including me believe Trump’s statement on this issue alone disqualifies him from being President. If he totally lacks an understanding of and respect for the constitution and 240 years of our history he shouldn’t be considered by voters.

Trump has denigrated, attacked and disrespected women, members of the military, Muslims, Latinos, people with disabilities and anyone who questions him in any way. Hillary is correct when she says this election is no longer about him it is about us. She said “I think it’s really up to all of us to demonstrate who we are and who our country is, and to stand up and be very clear about what we expect from our next president, how we want to bring our country together, where we don’t want to have the kind of pitting of people one against the other, where instead we celebrate our diversity, we lift people up, and we make our country even greater. America is great, because America is good. And it really is up to all of us to make that true, now and in the future, and particularly for our children and our grandchildren.”

The way for those who share those sentiments to demonstrate our support for them is to come out in large numbers and vote for Hillary. We must do that if we are to continue to warrant the high esteem people who believe in democracy have for the United States of America.

This election is crucial in so many ways. We must defeat Trump by the biggest possible margin and show the world who Americans really are and show our allies they can continue to trust us to keep our commitments to them.

The world is watching us closely. We are not only electing our President we are electing the leader of the free world. "
100788,1003,Donald Trump And The New Great Awakening,http://www.huffingtonpost.com/aaron-todd/donald-trump-and-the-new-_b_12474172.html?utm_hp_ref=politics,29,"As this election draws to its increasingly anticlimactic conclusion, I find myself becoming less and less worried about the prospect of a Trump presidency. I don’t want to jinx it, but Trump is going to lose on November 8. More than likely he will lose very badly. Some projections have Hillary Clinton winning with over 300 electoral votes. While I am doubtful that it will actually be that big of a blowout, I am confident that Donald Trump will soon become nothing but a bug on the windshield of the American Political Machine.

In fact, the splattering of the Trump Campaign began last night as numerous women came forward with allegations that Trump had accosted them with inappropriate (and illegal) sexual advances. There is now video of Trump admiring the figure of a 10-year-old girl and there are numerous reports that he walked in on half-dressed teenage girls during his beauty pageants. The reality is, he’s done. This will be the conversation for the next 4 weeks and he will have very little opportunity to change the narrative back to the necessity of fearing everyone who isn’t a rich white man. The prospect of Donald Trump sitting behind the desk on the Oval Office once filled me with dread, but now, I recognize that Trump is sad little man who will soon be rendered practically irrelevant by serious minds.

So let’s stop talking about Trump. Seriously, let’s stop doing it. Let’s talk about what happens AFTER November 8. While Trump will soon fade into irrelevancy, Trump has awakened something within the hearts of a sizable segment of the American population that will still be around on November 9.

Trump has given a rallying cry to those who long for the “good ol days” when white men held all the power and everyone else knew their place. He has lent credence to those who believe that America will be made “great” if we all put giant American flags on the backs of our trucks and carry our assault rifles into Walmart. He has given a voice to those who are convinced that “consent” is a made up term by the “Liberal Left” (I’m looking at you, Rush Limbaugh) and that the voice and bodies of women actually belong to the men in their life. He has emboldened those who harbor deeply imbedded racist tendencies and say stupid things like, “I’m not racist, but...” while believing that walls work and that minorities shouldn’t be able to sit at the lunch counter. He has developed a following that is willing to look the other way on numerous reports of sexual assaults but will continue to assail Clinton for mishandling e-mails.

The Trump movement has co-opted the Religious Right and led Evangelical Christianity to a dark place from which it might not be able to recover. While I applaud those at Liberty University who are finally standing up to Jerry Falwell, I fear that it is far too late and way too little. In the same way, Trumpism has instilled the belief otherwise rational and compassionate people of faith that Jesus would be a card-carrying manner of the NRA (spoiler alert: he wouldn’t be). 
The blind trust and loyalty that so many have given to Donald Trump is dangerous. Not only for the individual, but for the Republic. The American system of Government is based upon the bedrock belief in a peaceful transition of power. We now have people who are threatening a “revolution” if Clinton gets elected and promising to “watch” the polls to ensure that the election isn’t “stolen.” It is reasonable to expect numerous reports of voter intimidation on Election Day.

But you know what? Trump has also awakened something else. He has awakened a deeper realization that Party loyalty can only go so far. He has awakened the commitment by so many to double their efforts to work for peace, reconciliation, and healing. He has given a voice to those who are finding the courage to say, “It’s my body,” not yours. He is giving a rallying cry to those who say, “The way of Trump is not the way of Jesus.” He is instilling passion in those who are working on the front lines in the fields of education, mental health, and the prevention of gun violence. He is inadvertently reminding reasonable people that Love does indeed Trump Hate.

And this is what gives me hope for the future. I believe with every ounce of who I am as a human being that Love will win the day. Let’s just hope Hate doesn’t win the election."
100789,1003,Would You Rather Have A Beer With Donald Trump?,http://www.huffingtonpost.com/rizwan-a-rahmani/would-you-rather-have-a-b_b_12553530.html?utm_hp_ref=politics,29,"A few election cycles ago, many in our country decided that one of their main criteria for electing their president, leader of the free world and someone with their nuclear codes at their fingertips, was whether or not they would want to sit and have a beer with that person. The winner of that grand hypothetical matchup was George W. Bush. Take a moment and try that mental test with the current candidates. Maybe you would prefer to have a beer with Trump rather than Clinton, but would you feel comfortable letting your daughter have a beer with him?

When the country was reeling from the tape and claims of his assault of women by his own account, out came a drove of women who claim indecent acts were perpetrated on them by Donald Trump without their consent: sexual assault, without any doubt. What will it take for some of his would-be voters to abandon him in large numbers with their conscience intact? Why is he still in the running and enjoying poll numbers that confound our moral understanding? As the old saying goes, if it looks like a duck, swims like a duck, walks like a duck, etc. Right Donald? (Quack quack). Because if logic is our sentinel, we must believe some of these women. The coincidences are just too close for comfort to discount the stories as mere hearsay, embellished fictionalized accounts, or tall tales concocted so the women could parade their humiliation at the hands (as it were) of this vile person through the magnifying spectacle of the 24 hour media.

The slew of allegations that have come out since the second debate should surprise no one; Donald Trump has spoken his mind on several occasions on mainstream media. He has been announcing himself to the world in snippets, and showing his true colors for decades: some of us and his supporters just haven’t been listening. He has made plenty of off color remarks, including crude and demeaning comments about women, on national media that should have been the foreshadowing of things to come. It’s just unfortunate that he has made it this far before all this dirty laundry came out and sullied the whole process of our presidential process—as if it wasn’t already sullied enough.

While some of his supporters’ pathetic attempt to brush it off as some sort of ‘locker room banter’, the actual content of the conversation was much more sinister and repugnant than they would have you believe. In my experience some men do talk about women in ways that they wouldn’t under normal circumstances (mixed company), but the last time I heard anything even remotely as disturbing as this was when I was at a frat party and the person in question was an inebriated 20 years old sophomore—not a 59 year old aging roué bragging about his unwanted sexual advances while setting a despicable example to his younger cohorts.

The cult-like followers and the surrogates who are still by his side are intellectually and morally bankrupt: I know they are paid to do Donald Trump’s bidding, but really, how low you have to be to defend the indefensible just so you can bring home some putrid bacon, and make excuses for a man who has been found to be acting out reprehensibly - exactly how he described himself in those recordings? What is worse is that a lot of these surrogates are women who quite likely know from their own experiences what the women making accusations are talking about, and know what they have been through or why they didn’t come out with their story when the incidents first took place. Trump’s emphatic and categorical denial upon Anderson Cooper’s question - as Ms. Leeds expressed in her interview - may have been the straw that broke the camel’s back.

Despite some erosion in his poll numbers, Donald Trump continues to have a rather alarming level of support even after all that has transpired, and that is quite telling (he enjoys a healthy support among men). The fact that a lot of voters are even considering voting for this sham of an entertainer, who is more a self-selling, self-serving, serial assaulting impostor, says something about the electorate. When several women came forward accusing Bill Cosby, some of his staunch fans were not convinced, but the number of women was just too large to deem it fabrication. This time too, as in the case of Cosby, with all the women who are speaking out, it cannot be dismissed or excused.

We have a folk parable in India I heard growing up. The story goes that a jackal accidentally fell into a vat of color, and in the process ended up coloring his tail bright blue. When he swaggered back into the forest with his newly transformed looks, some of the animals, not recognizing him, started to treat the jackal with deference, and as a result he garnered quite a following. During a gathering with his followers, an old neighbor happened to pass by. As he made his way through the crowd, he recognized the jackal despite his colored tail, and cried out his name. Well, these women are finally calling out the jackal, and who he really is, and all the tail-dyeing in the world by his surrogates in not going to hide his true ilk."
100790,1004,Sheldon Adelson Has Reportedly Had It With Donald Trump,http://talkingpointsmemo.com/livewire/sheldon-adelson-cools-trump-support,29,"Donald Trump’s crash-and-burn performance at Wednesday’s presidential debate is just the latest in a long line of fundamental misjudgments that have left conservative mega-donors, casino magnate Sheldon Adelson chief among them, feeling burned by their fellow self-described billionaire.

According to a CNN report published Friday, Adelson has contributed up to $25 million in support of Trump’s candidacy, but recently has “bemoaned Trump's lack of focus and what he sees as squandered opportunities.”

At one point, he promised $100 million to support Trump, according to the Wall Street Journal—the same amount the candidate himself has pledged he would donate to his campaign. Both men will likely fall far short of that number.

Fox Business reported that before Wednesday's debate, Adelson had sent an email to Trump, telling him to stop attacking fellow Republicans like House Speaker Paul Ryan (R-WI), and to spend more time focusing on issues than complaining about media coverage. Though Trump has since quieted somewhat about his fellow Republicans, he continues to blame the national media for ""rigging"" the election.

One anonymous Adelson associate told Fox Business that Adelson had told him “Trump doesn’t listen to anyone—not even his family or Steve Bannon.” That associated added that Adelson told him he liked the Republican nominee “less and less.”

Fellow billionaire and conservative donor Foster Friess stayed mum to CNN on Adelson’s mood, saying he needed ""to reserve what communication that took place private.""

Adelson, like many others who would normally dump tens of millions of dollars behind a presidential candidate promising the largest tax break in American history, has instead shifted his focus to the fight for protecting Republican majorities in Congress, according to the CNN report.

An Adelson spokesman did not respond to CNN’s requests for comment.

According to Federal Election Commission filings published Thursday, Trump spent more than $70 million in September, nearly matching his previous two months of spending combined. Hillary Clinton spent $83 million."
100791,1004,Trump’s Political Director Withdraws From Campaign In Final Stretch,http://talkingpointsmemo.com/livewire/jim-murphy-trump-national-political-director-steps-back,29,"Donald Trump’s national political director will “step back” from his role overseeing the Republican nominee’s ground game with less than three weeks to go before Election Day, Politico reported Thursday.

With Trump trailing Clinton in a number of critical battleground states and lagging in the polls, this announcement could spell trouble for the campaign’s get-out-the-vote efforts.

""I have not resigned but for personal reasons have had to take a step back from the campaign,"" Jim Murphy told Politico in a statement, declining to offer more detail on the reason for his departure.

Politico reported that several Trump aides have expressed concern about Murphy’s absence as the race enters its final days.

Murphy’s retreat is only the latest staffing upset for the real estate mogul’s campaign. The veteran GOP operative came on board in June to replace Rick Wiley, who abruptly left the post after only six weeks on the team after clashing with then-campaign manager Corey Lewandowski.

Lewandowski himself was forced out over his brash managerial style and reportedly tense relationship with Trump’s three adult children, and his successor Paul Manafort also left the campaign after only a few months on the job."
100792,1004,"Trump: I'll Be 'Happy' Either Way, But Losing Would Sure Be A 'Waste Of Time'",http://talkingpointsmemo.com/livewire/trump-happy-win-or-lose,29,"During his rally in Fletcher, North Carolina, on Friday, Donald Trump told the crowd that he'll be happy with his effort on the campaign trail whether he wins or loses, but later on in his speech, he said losing would make his campaign a ""waste of time.""

Trump made his initial comment while boasting about his packed campaign rally schedule, saying that he does several events in a day.

""I don't know what kind of shape I'm in but I'll be happy, and at least I will have known, win, lose or draw — and I'm almost sure, if the people come out, we're going to win, but I will be — I will be happy with myself because I always say, I don't want to think back, 'If I only I did one more rally, I would have won North Carolina by 500 votes, instead of losing it by 200 votes, right? If only I did,'"" Trump said. ""So I never want to ever look back.""

""I never want to say that about myself. We have to work, you have to get everybody you know out there,"" he added.

But later, after the crowd in North Carolina began chanting, ""Lock her up,"" Trump offered a different perspective.

""Let's do this. November 8th, let's win. Let's win. Let's win,"" he said following the ""Lock her up"" chants now prevalent at his rallies. ""We win, we have lots of options but we got to win. What a waste of time if we don't pull this off.""

""You know, these guys have said, doesn't matter if you win or lose, there’s never been a movement like this in the history of this country. I say it matters to me whether we win or lose because—"" Trump continued, trailing off as the crowd cheered.

He then launched into a confusing bit about how much money he has put into his campaign.

""So, so I’ll have over $100 million of my own money in this campaign. So if I lose, if I lose, I will consider this — and the nice part about saying that, I only tell you that because that means I'm not taking all of this money from all of these people that Hillary is taking money,"" he said, before complaining that Hillary Clinton has not contributed as much as he has to her own campaign."

It turns out billionaire Richard Branson has a Trump story that illustrates Trump's obsession with vengeance perfectly.

Branson, the billionaire owner of the Virgin Group, wrote a post on his company's website on Friday afternoon describing an out-of-the-blue lunch the two men shared ""some years ago."" Branson says it was the first time he and Trump had met, but Trump had only one topic he wanted to discuss.

Even before the starters arrived he began telling me about how he had asked a number of people for help after his latest bankruptcy and how five of them were unwilling to help. He told me he was going to spend the rest of his life destroying these five people.

He didn't speak about anything else and I found it very bizarre. I told him I didn’t think it was the best way of spending his life. I said it was going to eat him up, and do more damage to him than them. There must be more constructive ways to spend the rest of your life. (Hopefully my advice didn’t lead to him running for President!)

I was baffled why he had invited me to lunch solely to tell me this. For a moment, I even wondered if he was going to ask me for financial help. If he had, I would have become the sixth person on his list!

Branson wrote earlier this month that ""Mr Trump's temperament is irrational [and] aggressive,"" and added on Friday that those character defects are perhaps the scariest part of this election. ""What concerns me most, based upon my personal experiences with Donald Trump, is his vindictive streak, which could be so dangerous if he got into the White House,"" Branson wrote.

The Trump campaign did not immediately respond to a request for comment from Mother Jones."

The new ad features Khan in his home, recounting how his son lost his life as a soldier in Iraq by sacrificing himself to save the rest of his unit from a suicide bomber. ""My son was Captain Humayun Khan, he was 27 years old, and he was a Muslim American,"" Khan says at the end of the ad. Then, fighting back tears, he continues, ""I want to ask Mr. Trump, would my son have a place in your America?"" The one-minute ad will run in Florida, Iowa, Nevada, New Hampshire, North Carolina, Ohio, and Pennsylvania."
100795,1005,Georgia on Her Mind,http://www.motherjones.com/politics/2016/10/clinton-trump-super-pac-georgia,29,"Hillary Clinton and her allies are sensing that the election could turn into a blowout—and they want to make sure the electoral map reflects it, putting resources into states so solidly red that Democrats typically ignore them. First there was Utah, which delivered Mitt Romney his largest margin of victory in 2012, but where the Clinton campaign senses it has a shot. Then came Arizona and even Texas.

Now add another deep-red state to the list: Georgia.

With Donald Trump faltering in the final weeks of the presidential campaign, the Clinton campaign and the powerhouse super-PAC supporting Clinton are looking to win in traditionally Republican strongholds in order to bolster Clinton's claims to a mandate and demonstrate to Republicans that Trumpism is not a viable path to the White House. On Monday, the Clinton campaign announced a $2 million investment in Arizona (and sent Michelle Obama to campaign there on Thursday night) as well as an ad buy in Texas.

And on Thursday, pro-Clinton super-PAC Priorities USA Action made the latest surprising investment, putting $2 million into ads in Georgia.

It's a startling turn in a race that just four weeks ago looked like a dead heat. Polling analysts haven't moved Georgia into toss-up territory yet, but Justin Barasky, communications director for Priorities USA Action, says the super-PAC's internal polling shows a race that Clinton can win. On Friday morning, the Atlanta Journal-Constitution released a poll showing the race within the margin of error in the Peach State.

The super-PAC chose what it believes is one of its most powerful ads for Georgia. Called ""My Daughter Grace,"" it features parents whose daughter has spina bifida reacting to footage of Trump mocking a disabled reporter. So far, the ad has run in the Atlanta, Macon, and Savannah media markets. It will run through Election Day. ""I think it's one of our most powerful ads,"" says Barasky. ""There was nothing that brought the vitriol and disapproval [more] than a 70-year-old billionaire mocking a disabled person did. So that really does—I don't know if appeal is even the right word—but it certainly turns off virtually everyone."""
100796,1006,When it comes to talk of a ‘rigged’ election the progressive left is already there,http://hotair.com/archives/2016/10/21/thoughts-talk-rigged-system/,29,"The issue that progressives suddenly seem very concerned about, i.e. that Donald Trump will corrode America’s faith in our electoral system, is a case of rushing to close the barn door after the horse has already gotten out. Whatever damage Trump has done in the past couple months can’t compare to what progressives themselves have been doing for the past 16 years.

The concern about Trump being expressed, seemingly everywhere this week, is that he will poison the well of democracy, i.e. he’ll convince people a presidential election was stolen. But that’s a concern about something that may happen in the future. What already has happened is that progressive Democrats have been making exactly this case, that a presidential election was stolen, for the past 16 years.

Before going any further, I have to say that I agree that having Trump repeatedly suggest the election is rigged strikes me as a really bad idea. I do think it could influence people to believe the election is tainted and therefore illegitimate. And barring proof of some actual electoral scandal, I don’t think that’s a good thing for America.

So while I don’t approve of what Trump is saying, it seems very clear to me that he’s far from the first person to say it. In fact, it was quickly pointed out after the 3rd debate that progressives have been saying something similar for 16 years. You may recall the phrase “selected not elected” which was shorthand for the idea that Bush was illegitimate because of Bush v. Gore.

There was plenty of push back to the comparison between Trump and Gore. Philip Bump wrote a piece for the Washington Post titled “Al Gore’s fight in 2000 was very different from the way Trump is undermining the process now.” Here’s Bump’s conclusion:

Gore’s fight was a fight over counting ballots, not over an allegation that the election itself was unfair. There were disputes about the intent of voters and some insincere rhetoric on both sides, but there was no question that the system, however flawed, was working the way it was supposed to. There was no question that Gore had won more votes nationally, but there was also no question that the 2000 election was one of the closest in history and that the result was the will of almost precisely half of the voting public. It was a test case for the strength of our democracy, as Gore noted, and we passed — however frustrating to Gore and his supporters then and in the years that followed.
I see what Bump is trying to do here but, intentionally or not, he has completely missed the point. I’d certainly grant that Al Gore wasn’t trash talking the system before the 2000 election. In that way it’s true that Gore and Trump are behaving very differently. I’d also grant that because of how close the election turned out, Gore was justified in waiting to see how the recount process would turn out and that his eventual concession message hit some good notes.

But that’s not the end of the story.

Contrary to Bump’s tidy summary in which Gore does the right thing and his supporters move past their frustration, reality has been somewhat different. This clip put together by Morning Joe offers a few highlights: All of this electoral skepticism trickles down. When Al Gore showed up to campaign with Hillary in Florida earlier this month, he was greeted with chants of “You won!” from the crowd. You can hear it yourself in this clip and notice that Hillary doesn’t seem horrified by this widespread skepticism of the system. On the contrary she seems to think it’s a hoot: Ultimately, it really doesn’t matter whether Al Gore is leading the chants of “You won!” That might be even worse, but the point is that lots of people are chanting it anyway and Gore certainly doesn’t correct them for it.

What matters ultimately is that the damage has been done. Faith in democracy has been eroded. The thing that the media and the professional left are suddenly very worried could happen…has happened already. There is widespread belief on the American left that one or more U.S. presidential elections were rigged or stolen.

Will things be even worse if people on the right start saying the same thing about 2016? Yes, I believe that would be even worse for the country, but it hasn’t happened yet and maybe it won’t. If it does then a segment of the right will be landing in territory progressives have been occupying proudly for more than a decade. "
100797,1006,"Poll: 45% of Republicans say they’re unlikely to, or definitely won’t, accept the election result if Trump loses",http://hotair.com/archives/2016/10/21/poll-45-republicans-say-theyre-unlikely-definitely-wont-accept-election-result-trump-loses/,29,"Why is it a problem for Trump? Because there’s evidence that the more people are convinced that their political system is corrupt, the less likely they are to vote. Trump is out there every day telling his fans that the election is rigged, sometimes in terms of the media being in the tank for Hillary but in other cases in terms of actual cheating at the polls. I’d bet cash money that Kellyanne Conway has asked him privately to tone that down, not just because it’ll make it harder to put the party back together after the election but because she knows he’s inadvertently suppressing his own turnout. To have any chance at an upset, Trump needs working-class whites who typically don’t vote in elections — “undercover Trump voters” — to feel it’s worth their time to turn out next month. If instead they’re now convinced that the election’s rigged, guess what happens to turnout?

A 2012 study looked at this phenomenon:

Among Americans in the 2012 ANES survey who believe that votes are “very often” counted fairly, over three-quarters (77 percent) reported that they voted. By contrast, among those with strong doubts about this process, just two-thirds (64 percent) bothered to vote, generating a net 13-point gap.

When asked whether they thought that electoral officials were fair, similar patterns can be observed, where greater trust is significantly associated with higher voter turnout. None of the other claims about electoral malpractice was observed to have a similar effect on turnout, including problems of media bias, lack of genuine choice and campaign finance…

In September 2016, a Gallup poll found that only 6 in 10 Americans were very or fairly confident that their vote would be accurately cast and counted in the U.S. election, down from around three-quarters of all Americans a decade earlier. But among Republicans, the proportion who were confident dropped to around half, the lowest which the Gallup poll has ever recorded on this question when asked in a series of surveys. Other polls have found that Trump voters are especially likely to believe that voter fraud occurs often.
As noted, Republicans generally and Trump fans specifically are already inclined to believe that vote-rigging is going on, even before Trump started using his megaphone to hammer that point. Independents, who vote less regularly than strong partisans, are also unusually likely to see turnout drop if they’re convinced that the election isn’t fair, which is bad news for a candidate like Trump who’s targeting indies with his own independent, anti-establishment brand. Giving your target constituencies a good reason not to vote by crying “voter fraud” seems like a bad play for a guy who’s relying on enthusiasm from his base rather than traditional ground-game mechanisms to get people to the polls. And for the larger GOP, it’s a disaster in the making if perceptions that this election was stolen linger among the Republican base, as that might suppress turnout in 2018 and beyond. If “they” can steal the presidency from Trump, some will say, why bother participating in the system at all, even in a midterm cycle two years from now that looks primed for a Republican blowout? That’s a big reason why so many GOP apparatchiks, from establishmentarians like Reince Priebus and Paul Ryan to Trump recruits like Conway and Mike Pence, will be pushing back on the “rigged!” narrative next month. The party’s already alienated too many other voters to lose parts of its base as well to the suspicion that voting is meaningless.

Here’s Rush Limbaugh this afternoon wondering if there’ll be riots if Clinton gets 500 electoral votes. Or does he mean riots by the left if Trump gets 500 electoral votes? It’s hard to tell. Nothing to worry about either way, although I’m curious what he thinks will happen if Clinton gets 400. That’s highly unlikely too, but not quite completely off the board. "

Alan Abramowitz’s “Time for Change” model also pointed to a probable GOP win based on things like the state of the economy, the president’s job approval, and whether the party in power has been there for two terms or just one. Abramowitz disowned his own model’s prediction this summer, though, on the theory that it only explains whether a generic Republican should defeat a generic Democrat or vice versa. When you have a nominee who’s not at all generic, who in fact much of the public deeply dislikes and has deemed unfit for office, then don’t be surprised if that affects the results. In other words, the “Time for Change” model doesn’t say who will win the election so much as which party should have won it. And therein lies the tragedy for Republicans in 2016.

This model, called the “Primary Model,” looks at different factors than “Time for Change,” although the amount of time that the incumbent party has been in power is relevant in both. Unlike Abramowitz, though, the man who developed it is sticking to his guns.

Helmut Norpoth has been predicting a Trump victory since early this year. His model currently projects a win for the Republican with a certainty of 87 to 99 percent…

Instead of opinion polling, Norpoth relies on statistics from candidates’ performances in party primaries and patterns in the electoral cycle to forecast results. The model correctly predicted the victor in every presidential election since 1996, according to the Daily Mail.

Running the model on earlier campaigns comes up with the correct outcome for every race since 1912, except the 1960 election.
Here’s what Norpoth wrote a few days ago at the Hill:

To start with something basic, opinion polls are really about “opinions,” not actions. At their best, they can tell us how people feel about political issues and personalities. Do voters, for instance, like or dislike candidates such as Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump?

Yet having an opinion and acting on it are two different things. Barely 6 in 10 voting-age American citizens turn out for presidential elections. Ascertaining the opinions of 100 citizens is just a start. Now you have to determine which 60 of them actually take the time to mark a ballot. They are the “likely voters.” They are the only ones that count. But to find them is no easy chore.

It is ingrained in all of us that voting is civic duty. So nearly all of us say, oh yes, I’ll vote, and then many will not follow through. Miscalculations of which respondents will turn out to vote can easily screw up a poll prediction, so would it be sure thing if we just dealt with actual voters?
He’s suggesting, in other words, that turnout on Election Day might look very different from how most pollsters seem to believe that it will. Maybe many Americans who only tepidly support Hillary will stay home and/or many who strongly support Trump but don’t usually vote will show up. That argument should be familiar to you by now — it’s the “undercover Trump voters” theory, that there are lots of people out there planning to turn out for Trump this year who aren’t showing up in polls for whatever reason. Either they’ve been left off of voter lists used by pollsters because they’ve registered to vote only very recently or they’re embarrassed to tell pollsters they’re supporting Trump so they lie and say they’re for Hillary or Gary Johnson instead. Anything’s possible, but pollsters are aware of the possibility that Trump will bring out “unlikely voters” who haven’t voted much in recent years and have spent the campaign trying to incorporate them into the data. The Clinton campaign has a sophisticated data operation that’s desperate to identify these people, I’m sure, so that they know how to allocate their resources in the final few weeks. If there are 200,000 white rural votes sitting out there for Trump in Pennsylvania that none of the public pollsters know about, Team Hillary will be doing everything it can to uncover them and then adjust its ground game and ad spending accordingly. Needless to say, with so many pollsters now pointing to a comfortable Clinton win, to miscalculate the number of likely voters so badly that a six- to seven-point polling advantage suddenly disappears on Election Day would be the most catastrophic failure in the history of American polling. A lot of statistical brainpower has gone into averting that humiliation and getting turnout expectations right.

In fact, the first inklings from early voting point more to the polls being right than wrong:

More than 3.3 million Americans have already voted. And among that group, Democrats have improved their position in North Carolina, Nevada, Arizona and even Utah compared to this point in 2012…

Democratic early turnout has stayed steady in North Carolina compared to 2012, while Republicans have dropped by about 14,500. In Nevada, Democrats have a smaller early voting deficit today than they did at this point in 2012. And Democrats are slightly ahead in Arizona in the early vote so far, though they are lagging Republicans in the tally of how many Arizonans have requested ballots.

Perhaps most surprisingly, Democrats improved their position in conservative and Mormon-heavy Utah, where recent polls have shown a tight race. At this point in 2012, Republicans led Democrats in early voting by more than 22,000 voters. But so far this year, the GOP advantage is only 3,509.
By Nate Cohn’s estimates, Trump has a five-point lead in North Carolina among absentee voters right now, which sounds good until you know that Mitt Romney had a … 33-point lead at the same stage of the 2012 election. Trump is way off the traditional pace. The early-voting numbers look much better for him in Ohio and Iowa, but that’s consistent with the polls too. Those two states have been his strongest battlegrounds all year. His path to 270 begins with winning those two, but he’d also need Florida and North Carolina to have any shot at the presidency — and as noted here, the early numbers in NC don’t look good.

As for the “Primary Model,” if I understand the methodology correctly, Norpoth is essentially extrapolating each nominee’s relative strength from how they did in the New Hampshire and South Carolina primaries. Trump won both comfortably but Clinton got blown out in NH before coming back big in SC. The idea, I guess, is that the candidate with the most enthusiastic base wins in November. Two problems with that, though. One: The New Hampshire primary was basically a home game for Bernie Sanders, who lives next door in Vermont. Hillary looked weaker there than she did in most other Democratic primaries this year because of his regional advantage. Two: Although both parties have partly fractured over their nominees this year, most polls at this point show Clinton winning more Democratic votes than Trump winning Republican ones. He’s the one dealing with the deeper party schism, especially since his “Access Hollywood” tape and the sexual-assault accusations started trickling out. I’m not sure how the “Primary Model” accounts for that. Trump’s supporters may be more motivated to vote than Clinton’s supporters, but if Clinton’s party — with plenty of “soft” supporters — is more motivated to vote on balance than Republicans are, what does that do to the model? And what about the data that shows, er, that primary turnout means nothing for the general election?

Incidentally, Norpoth notes in his column as an argument against trusting the polls that (a) the exit polls in 2004 were famously wrong in suggesting a 51/48 Kerry win and (b) Gallup was famously wrong in 2012 when it predicted Romney as the winner in its final national poll. Both of those points are true — but only partly. The preliminary exit polls in 2004 did indeed go bust, but the final exit polls saw a Bush win and got very close to capturing the final margin. Gallup’s failure four years ago is well known, especially to conservative bloggers like me who clung to their numbers as evidence that Romney had a real chance. But that’s why data nerds are constantly nudging people not to focus on individual polls but rather on poll averages. You can’t put too much stock in any one pollster, even one as esteemed as Gallup, since their sample may produce an outlier by chance or its turnout model may be flawed. The poll average, which incorporates many samples and many different turnout models, is likely to be closer to the eventual result. The nerds will also tell you to follow state polls more closely than national ones since, after all, Election Day is 50 separate state elections, not one national election. And in fact, the state polling averages were almost perfect four years ago in calling the outcome, pointing to the correct winner in every state except Florida. Saying that all polling is unreliable because of Gallup four years ago seems to me a bit like saying that you can’t trust the stock market because Enron went bust. The answer to that problem is diversification, not hoarding money in the mattress.

Incidentally, thanks to Marco Rubio’s poor performance in the New Hampshire and South Carolina primaries, the “Primary Model” gave Hillary Clinton an 86 percent chance of defeating him in the general election. Show of hands — who thinks Trump will finish with a higher share of the vote next month than Rubio would have?"
100799,1008,Hillary’s Plot Against America,http://www.americanthinker.com/articles/2016/10/hillarys_plot_against_america.html,29,"Recent news and leaks make it clear that a plot is afoot. A smoking gun has been found. Republicans are committing political malpractice by not making it clear they are the last line of defense.

ObamaCare is imploding, as was widely predicted upon its passage by Republicans and a range of non-partisan experts. The ObamaCare meltdown is even worse than we thought. Bloomberg News recently:

A growing number of people in Obamacare are finding out their health insurance plans will disappear from the program next year, forcing them to find new coverage even as options shrink and prices rise.

At least 1.4 million people in 32 states will lose the Obamacare plan they have now, according to state officials contacted by Bloomberg. That’s largely caused by Aetna Inc., UnitedHealth Group Inc. and some state or regional insurers quitting the law’s markets for individual coverage.

Sign-ups for Obamacare coverage begin next month. Fallout from the quitting insurers has emerged as the latest threat to the law, which is also a major focal point in the U.S. presidential election. While it’s not clear what all the consequences of the departing insurers will be, interviews with regulators and insurance customers suggest that plans will be fewer and more expensive, and may not include the same doctors and hospitals.

It may also mean that instead of growing in 2017, Obamacare could shrink. As of March 31, the law covered 11.1 million people; an Oct. 13 S&P Global Ratings report predicted that enrollment next year will range from an 8 percent decline to a 4 percent gain.

Far more people are being afflicted by premiums and deductibles that are soaring, regardless of whether they have coverage under Obamacare plans or private or employer based insurance.  Premiums are increasing by high double digits in many states (the national average premium increase will be 24.2% in 2017) and deductibles have grown so much that health care costs are devouring a record eight percent of the typical household budget in the wake of ObamaCare.

Barack Obama’s oft-quoted promise that “if you like your health care plan, you can keep it” has been living up to its dubious distinction granted in 2013 as the “lie of the year.”   Actually, it is the biggest lie in decades and he and his people knew it was a lie all along.  Remember that the bill’s architect admitted that they relied on the “stupidity of the American people” to help the bill pass and three Obama speechwriters laughed about it on a PBS show.  The lie may have been erased from the Obamacare website after it had served its purpose but many millions are enduring the reality of the disaster.

Republicans knew it was a lie; not one Republican in either the Senate or the House voted for the absurdly titled “Affordable Care and Patient Protection Act.” They tried to mitigate the damage from the deviously passed legislation by inserting into a 2014 spending bill a provision that prevents Obama and the Democrats from bailing out insurance companies. Barack Obama is again trying to circumvent the law by tapping the so-called Judgement Fund for billions of dollars to keep ObamaCare afloat. This would be illegal.  House Republicans have filed a brief in a lawsuit that seeks to prevent the bailout of insurance companies.

Clearly, Obama is trying to keep Obamacare on life support until …what? The facts and basic economics are on the side of Republicans; the program is a disaster. Even Democrats have begun to waken to the reality of the problems they face from ObamaCare. Minnesota Governor Mark Dayton, previously one of its most fervent supporters, declared Obamacare “no longer affordable.”  Even President Obama, as much as he lives in some fabulist world of his own imagination, cannot avoid reality and admitted there were problems in his legacy achievement.  Predictably, he blamed Republicans even though they opposed Obamacare at every opportunity.  Were they to blame because they did not want to be complicit in the man-made disaster he and his Democratic allies have imposed on America?

But there is a tell, and it reveals Hillary Clinton’s remedy for the ills of ObamaCare.  is worse than the disease.  Hillary’s frenemy Bill Clinton shockingly admitted that ObamaCare is the “craziest thing in the world” since Americans ” wind up with premiums doubled and their coverage cut in half and it’s the craziest thing in the world”. Clearly, Bill Clinton was sending a message -- wittingly or not -- that big changes were afoot and big government was coming to the rescue.

What is Hillary Clinton plotting should she become President?

Wikileaks revealed an email that is a smoking gun. Despite a massive media blackout, some of the emails see the light of day on social and conservative media.  HillaryClinton wrote an email to senior policy advisor Ann O’Leary that disclosed she was working, behind the scenes (naturally since she has a public persona -- or multiple ones, actually -- and a private one) to undermine the Affordable Care Act.

Jeffrey Anderson writes at the Weekly Standard:

If further evidence were needed that this country faces two choices going forward on health care, a leaked Hillary Clinton email just provided it. The choices we face are (a) the repeal of Obamacare and its replacement with a conservative alternative, or (b) a government monopoly. Obamacare cannot last, and even the Democratic nominee for president is apparently seeking, and pushing for, its demise.

A WikiLeaks release Tuesday shows Clinton writing the following in an email exchange, reportedly with senior policy adviser Ann O'Leary:


In the email, Clinton conveys her support for Republicans' ill-advised effort to repeal—or delay—Obamacare's ""Cadillac tax."" (Such efforts are ill-advised because Republicans should be pushing for full repeal, not catering to various interest groups in pushing for partial repeal.) But the striking thing is Clinton's motivation: She wants the Democrats ""to be careful"" to let the Republicans' legislation pass, because that legislation, she conveys, ""begins the unraveling of the ACA"" [Obamacare].

That doesn't sound like someone who's trying to make Obamacare better, which Clinton has campaigned as being committed to doing. Rather, while posing as an Obamacare supporter, she has been eager to see President Obama's signature legislation ""unravel,"" so that it can to give way to a true government monopoly.

Hillary clearly wants her own legacy to supersede that of Barack Obama’s: HillaryCare.

Recall that as First Lady during her husband’s first presidency she tried and tried but failed disastrously to get her version of healthcare “reform” passed.  She seems very determined to leave her own mark, even if it meant conniving behind President Obama’s back to replace ObamaCare.

What form would Hillary Care take? Phil Gramm wrote a Wall Street column giving us a glimpse of the horrors to come in “Where Clinton will take Obamacare”:

In claiming earlier this year that the current U.S. health-care system “was HillaryCare before it was called ObamaCare,” Hillary Clinton was telling the truth—but not the whole truth  (snip)

HillaryCare was a comprehensive plan for the government to take over the health-care system, with program details and cost-control measures precisely defined. (snip)

As with HillaryCare, a single payer, national health-care system has always been the goal.

Hillary Clinton’s Health Security Act of 1993 would have broken the nation’s health-care system into regional Healthcare Purchasing Cooperatives, which would have collectively set treatment guidelines and implemented cost-control measures.  (snip)

The decisions of HillaryCare’s National Control Board, which would have determined every allowable benefit and treatment, would have been final—not reviewable by any agency or judge. (snip)

Except for the fact that it is occurring right before the elections, the four largest national health insurers dropping out of ObamaCare is not a problem. This is the plan. Eliminating the facade of private insurance is how ObamaCare “morphs” into HillaryCare and ultimately into a single-payer plan like Medicaid or Medicare. (snip)

For the ObamaCare of today to be transformed into the HillaryCare of 1993 and finally into a nationalized health-care system, a president is needed who has the willpower to impose the coercive details, nail down hard deadlines and unleash agencies to tighten controls and squeeze the life out of private insurers.

This is Hillary Clinton’s plot against America.

If you dislike ObamaCare, you will hate HillaryCare. What dAmericans have to look forward to: rationing,   loss of freedom, long lines and mediocre care (2/3 of doctors say ObamaCare hurts quality and cost of healthcare), nationalized health care.

True, a President Trump would prevent this plot from reaching its fruition. What should be the backup plan? Republicans were successful in putting into place provisions severely weakening ObamaCare to the extent that it is rapidly collapsing on its own pile of lies. They can prevent HillaryCare just as they did back in 1993 in is first rollout. But they need control of Congress, or, at the very least, the House. They might not be able to repeal and replace ObamaCare but they have put in place measures that are crippling its implementation, something they get far too little credit for doing. When Democrats elected Barack Obama and controlled Congress they burdened America with Obamacare. Does anyone think Chuck Schumer, Nancy Pelosi and President Hillary Clinton will stop there if that triad assumed power?

As Kimberly Strassel recently wrote in “Make Democrats Own Obamacare”:

ObamaCare is roaring back as a political liability to Democrats in a way not seen since that 2010 wave election. Right in time for this fall’s presidential contest, insurers are bailing out of the government system, leaving millions of voters with dwindling options and skyrocketing premiums. ObamaCare was always destined to crack up, but there is something notable that it comes precisely as so much control of Washington is up for grabs.

Especially since the health law is playing an outsize role in the states that will matter most for which party controls the Senate. At least three crucial elections feature Democrats who provided the final Senate votes to make ObamaCare the law of the land. Several other high-profile races are playing out in states where the health law has wreaked particular damage.

Republicans should pin the tail of ObamaCare on the Democratic Donkey. Not to do so is political malpractice-a chronic disease among Republicans.

Why aren’t Republicans running against ObamaCare and raising the specter of something worse and more horrifying to come: HillaryCare?

100800,1008,How ISIS Threatens Core American Values,http://www.americanthinker.com/articles/2016/10/how_isis_threatens_core_american_values.html,29,"The media frequently and correctly point out that ISIS (Islamic State in Iraq and Syria) has killed far more Muslims than non-Muslims.  Hence, some have suggested that ISIS is against Muslims.  Wrong.

The greatest violence perpetrated by ISIS has been in the Middle East.  Also, statistically speaking, one has a greater chance of dying from heart-related diseases than from a terror attack. 

Hence, some have suggested that we must be worried, but not unduly fret over ISIS here in the U.S.  Or, as articulated by some (most prominently by President Obama), ISIS does not pose an existential threat to the U.S.

I respectfully disagree.  And I will tell you why.

First, we must analyze what exactly ISIS is.  The ""brand"" ISIS represents is very different from the ""organization"" structured in the Middle East.  An accurate understanding will also explain why most Muslims happen to be vehemently against ISIS.

ISIS is a radical Muslim organization that espouses a return to the roots of Islam (hence the phrase ""Islamic fundamentalism"" we hear about often).  Of course, there is no consensus as to what that would mean to more than a billion Muslims around the world.  This is where ISIS emphasizes (and violently enforces) the ISIS version of Islam.  And it will kill anyone (including Muslims) who disagrees.

Just consider two examples where ISIS's understanding of Islam differs from the vast majority of the Muslim world.  The first one is cultural, the second religious.

 Music: Music is immensely popular in the Muslim world.  ISIS is absolutely against music, period.  But wait; there is more.  ISIS is also against religious music – like the ""azan"" or ""Islamic call to prayer,"" a regularity in nearly all countries with a substantial Muslim population.
 Pilgrimage: The Prophet's mosque in Medina (where Prophet Muhammad is buried) is one of the holiest sites in Islam, frequented by millions of Muslims every year.  On 06 July 2016, ISIS attacked the Prophet's mosque, as ISIS perceives it as idol-worship.
That being said, it would be a huge mistake to interpret from the above that ISIS is against Islam or Muslims.  It is not.  ISIS is against everything it believes is un-Islamic, including what it thinks is ""wrongful religious practice"" by the vast majority of Muslims around the world. 

Now you know why they bombed Medina.

And needless to mention, ISIS is vehemently against non-Muslims.  ISIS considers the actions of non-Muslims un-Islamic by definition.

Now consider the organization.  The ISIS leadership is based in Iraq and Syria, embroiled in a ""war"" against the governments in these countries.  Given the demographics of the region, it is but natural that their first line of conflict would be with the ""other"" Muslims (who are an overwhelming majority in the region).

The reason ISIS has killed more Muslims than non-Muslims is simply because the overwhelming majority of the population in their area of operation comprises Muslims.  Not because ISIS is against Muslims.

This brings us to the next question.  If ISIS is an extremist group based in Iraq and Syria, why does it pose an existential threat to the U.S.?

I think this is because there is a fundamental misunderstanding about what ISIS represents in mainstream conversation.  One tends to confuse the ""ISIS organization"" with the ""ISIS brand."" 

There is a group called ISIS in the Middle East, where the leadership is based.  And then there is a brand called ISIS.  This brand has co-opted social media campaigns, bombing, and brutality.  And yes, this brand is very dangerous and operates globally.

Take the attacks in Mumbai, Paris, and San Bernardino.  Or the shootings in the Orlando nightclub.  Most of the victims there were probably non-Muslims.  Why?  Because non-Muslims formed the majority in these places.

This explains the modus operandi of the ISIS organization and ISIS brand.  They do not care for lives, Muslim or non-Muslim.  They will destroy everything they think is un-Islamic.  This means they are against all non-Muslims and the vast majority of Muslims.

The risk the U.S. faces is less from the ISIS organization and more from the ISIS brand.  It would be a huge mistake to conflate the two.

What is at stake here is the First Amendment itself, the very right to free speech.  Hence, it might be prudent to consider that the ISIS brand is an existential threat to everything America stands for.

100801,1008,The Elites and Open Borders,http://www.americanthinker.com/articles/2016/10/the_elites_and_open_borders.html,29,"No one wants to leave his or her own family unprotected. There is no such thing as a true proponent of open borders. It is only a question of what the borders look like -- and whom they are designed to protect.

When almost everyone believed in nationalism, or what we used to simply think of as patriotism, borders got drawn around the country as a whole. Nobody questioned it, or even thought about it. The border was defended by the military and the border patrol. America, the “national family” in the public mind, was defined by the people whom the border protected -- the citizens of the United States. In the current, post-nationalist way of thinking that is the brainchild of progressives, the elites who advocate for open borders certainly don’t intend to let American riffraff into their neighborhoods -- let alone the great unwashed of foreign shores. Their borders are the gated community, the homeowner’s association, the local police or private security, and, in the case of high government officials, the Secret Service. The polity are the political, media, and academic elites and their retainers. To them, what it is important to protect is no longer the nation, but rather the class.

This modern conception of borders is, in some ways, a throwback to the Middle Ages, when the landed aristocracy lived in castles with retinues of armed men, and had a deeper sense of kinship with the nobility of other nations than they had with their own peasants. In some ways, unfortunately, the current state of affairs is worse than medieval. In the Middle Ages, a large population meant both military power and economic wealth. The nobleman might look down upon the humble peasant, but he had a vested interest in protecting him. Now, in an age in which both wars and industry are increasingly the province of machines, most of the populace yields very little benefit to the people who rule over them. When people vote in line with the aristocracy’s wishes, they retain some marginal political value. When they don’t, they are seen as nothing but a resource-hungry nuisance. The revelations from Wikileaks have shown this clearly. No U.S. citizen now living on the dole should be fooled into believing that the elites look down from their high places with loving concern. Peons are not cherished. Moreover, a dirty peon of one’s own country is no better than a dirty peon of a foreign one. Citizenship is a concept that progressives have slated for destruction, as it gives rights to people with whom the elites feel no particular kinship. To the remarkably insular ruling class, the people who run the machines and make the lattes are fungible. That we are deemed “deplorable” as soon as we rebel against the interests of the elites should come as no surprise. If the ragged remnants of our democratic institutions can ever be dissolved or fully nullified, we will find out just how little we matter. Some of us are finding out already.

One need look no further for hard evidence of this process than the current state of the black community. Perhaps the welfare programs of the 1960s and 1970s really were an attempt to fix the problems of the ghetto, but by any measure other than the simple alleviation of hunger, the welfare state has made things worse. There is now more illegitimacy, more crime, more drugs, and fewer jobs in predominantly black communities than there were in 1960. However, the gated community, the homeowner’s association, and the local police in the most affluent neighborhoods make this a distant and rather academic problem for the ruling class. The failure of social programs to eliminate actual poverty has had no real consequences for policy makers themselves. So why should they care? Impoverished, miseducated people living on the taxpayer’s largess can usually be counted on to vote for the people who confiscate their livelihood for them. Conveniently, the Black Lives Matter narrative -- that the racist police that patrol the ghetto are the oppressive force that keeps the black population down -- does no substantive harm to the elites either. Policymakers do not own the little businesses that end up getting burned or looted in riots. Those belong to peons of one sort or another, and are expendable. The political class can only be glad for a narrative that absolves their failed policies of any culpability. Section 8 housing subsidies that relocate the decivilized populations of the inner cities to middle class neighborhoods never deposit their beneficiaries in Georgetown, Marin County, or the Hamptons. Chappaqua NY, where Hillary Clinton lives, has an African-American population of a mere 0.94% -- and those are, no doubt, well-educated and successful professionals like everybody else in Chappaqua. To the elites, middle class neighborhoods and poor neighborhoods are functionally indistinguishable -- both places they never visit, populated by unfortunates and inferiors in a variety of unpleasant shapes, sizes and colors. A person who lives in Bethesda (an affluent suburb of Washington DC) is far more likely to visit the nicer parts of London or Paris than any part of SE Washington. A defended border around the U.S. makes no sense to such a person. Their true nation consists of an archipelago of protected enclaves of their own kind scattered here and there across the Western world.

The question of Islamic migrants yields entirely the same story. Any Muslims who live among the elites are themselves educated -- and largely westernized -- elites. You will find no Syrian refugees in Georgetown, Marin County, or the Hamptons for the same reason you will find no Section 8 housing there. So long as terrorists only kill off members of the lower classes, the damage they do can be seen as a statistical abstraction. If you look at Islamic terrorism statistically, the numbers of victims are indeed quite small – far, far fewer than the numbers accounted for by ordinary crime or traffic accidents. When Obama said groups like ISIL (ISIS) are not an existential threat to the U.S. -- this is exactly what he meant. There are more than 300 million Americans. What’s a few dozen, a few hundred, or even a few thousand more or less? Stalin said famously -- “The death of one man is a tragedy, the death of millions is a statistic.” The problem for us is that we are among the rats rather than among the experimenters. That more people die in traffic accidents is not the point. The government makes some effort to reduce the death toll from traffic accidents. In the case of the dangers posed by Islamic migrants, however, the elites have taken the position that a few deaths among the peasantry are more than worth the perpetuation of their diversity meme. They were shaken by 9/11 -- but only because that attack managed to kill a few of their own.

While I cannot, in good conscience, recommend actually hating anyone, I have come to find the passivity and naive optimism of many of my fellow middle class citizens unbearable. The daily drumbeat of outrages against the great sleepy bulk of the American public should not be, and cannot be, ignored. Our republic has been quietly suspended, not in favor of a better and more modern form of government, but in favor of a far older and infinitely worse one. Friedrich Hayek warned us this was coming in The Road to Serfdom -- and now it has arrived. We are ruled with no less callous disregard than we might expect if we’d been invaded by a foreign army. Any customer picked at random from a Walmart in the heartland of America would probably serve the public interests better than either the Democratic nominee, or the current Republican Speaker of the House.

100802,1009,WHAT’S UP WITH THE POLLS?,http://www.powerlineblog.com/archives/2016/10/whats-up-with-the-polls.php,29,"There’s quite a variance in the polling numbers for Trump and Hillary Clinton, complicated by the fact that some polls only offer a choice between the two major party candidates, and ignore Gary Johnson and the Green Party’s Jill Stein. Some polls have Hillary leading by as much as 15 points, while the Los Angeles Times poll continues to show Trump leading or virtually tied. (The methodology of the Times poll has received a lot of criticism, yet the Times poll was very close to the exact result in 2012.)

Usually when you hear a candidate or his supporters claim that the polls are wrong, it’s because they know they are losing. This is one reason why Trump has pivoted from talking about how great his poll numbers are to the “rigged election” theme. Could this be the first time that the majority of the polls are completely off? That’s what happened in Britain’s last general election, where the polls badly underestimated Conservative Party strength, which was attributed to “shy Tories.” (See charts below.) And the Brexit polls were wrong, too. Could there be a lot of “shy Trumpers” out there?

Maybe, but it’s worth pausing for a moment and understanding why polling is becoming so difficult and more volatile. Nature magazine, of all unlikely places, has a good article out this week about the methodological problems with polls. Among other things, the Nature article makes clear that most political polling, both here and in the UK, skew toward the left. Hence the calls for “unskewing” the polls are not fanciful.

A few excerpts since Nature is behind a subscription paywall:

The polling crisis: How to tell what people really think

Hillary Clinton is heading for a landslide victory over Donald Trump. But wait. Trump is pulling ahead and could take the White House. No, Clinton has a clear lead and is gaining ground. Nearly every day, a new poll comes out touting a different result, leaving voters wondering what to believe. . .

As the US presidential election approaches, pollsters are scrambling to improve their methods and avoid another embarrassing mistake. Their job is getting harder. Until as recently as ten years ago, polling organizations were able to tap into public opinion simply by calling people at home. But large segments of the population in developed countries have given up their landlines for mobile phones. That is making them more difficult for pollsters to reach because people will often not answer calls from unfamiliar numbers.

So the pollsters are fighting back. They are fine-tuning their efforts in reaching mobile phones, using statistical tools to correct for biases and turning to online surveys. . .

“Polling is an art, but it’s largely a scientific endeavour,” says Michael Link, president and chief executive of Abt SRBI polling firm in New York City and former president of the American Association for Public Opinion Research. . .

In the 2015 UK general election, most major pollsters, including ICM Unlimited and YouGov, underestimated the turnout of older, Conservative Party voters, according to an inquiry published in March by the British Polling Council and Market Research Society1. The inquiry also found that pollsters have systematic biases in their samples. They tend to have too many Labour supporters at the expense of Conservative ones. They had applied weighting and adjustment procedures to the raw data, but this has not mitigated the bias problem. Another source of error identified in the report is “herding” — when pollsters consciously or unconsciously adjust their polls so that their results seem similar to those released earlier, causing the polls to converge.

The bias in favour of left-leaning parties is not unique to the United Kingdom. The inquiry analysed more than 30,000 polls from 45 countries and found a similar, although smaller, bias. The report did not give an explanation for why, but some pollsters in the United States and Britain attribute the trend to inaccurate predictions of who will turn up to vote. . .

A variation on this is the ‘shy Tory effect’, named after Conservative-leaning voters in the United Kingdom who hide their views or misreport their intentions to pollsters. That makes some experts wonder whether a shy Trump effect might come into play in the forthcoming US election — in which a fraction of voters are embarrassed about or reluctant to admit their support for Trump or opposition to Clinton. But most major pollsters doubt that this will be a major factor because polls before the Republican primary elections gauged support for Trump accurately and he has performed similarly in online polls and in ones that use live interviews.

Stay tuned. My expectation is that Trump will close strong, and the race will be closer than the current Oval Office drape measurers think."
100803,1009,CLINTON FOUNDATION EMPLOYED SENIOR MUSLIM BROTHERHOOD OFFICIAL,http://www.powerlineblog.com/archives/2016/10/clinton-foundation-employed-senior-muslim-brotherhood-official.php,29,"Gehad El-Haddad, the now-imprisoned former spokesman for the Egyptian Muslim Brotherhood’s “Freedom and Justice Party,” was paid by the Clinton Foundation even as he promoted the Brotherhood’s interests as an adviser to Egypt’s Mohamed Morsi. So reports Patrick Poole at PJ Media.

Poole calls Gehad “the Baghdad Bob of the Arab Spring.” According to Poole, while serving Morsi’s Muslim Brotherhood government, Gehad incited violence, justified the torture of protesters, recycled fake news stories, and staged fake scenes of confrontation during the 2013 Rabaa protests.

Poole relies in part on Gehad’s Linkedin page, in which he refers to himself as “Senior Adviser & Media Spokesperson at Muslim Brotherhood.” For “Current” he states:

Muslim Brotherhood, Renaissance Project, Freedom and Justice Party.

For “Previous” he states:

William J. Clinton Foundation, Qabila, Industrial Modernization Center.

Further down the page, where he describes his time with the Clinton Foundation, he states that he worked for the Foundation from August 2007 – August 2012. Morsi came to power in the last month or two of this period.

Before Morsi came to power, Gehad served as his campaign spokesman. He was on the Clinton Foundation’s payroll throughout this time and during a longer period during which, says Poole, he held various posts with the Brotherhood. Thus, as Poole puts it, “the Clinton Foundation subsidized one of the senior Egyptian Muslim Brotherhood officials in his rapid rise to power.”

Once Morsi came to power, Gehad became an apologist for the Muslim Brotherhood’s attacks on the judiciary and the police. Poole presents some of Gehad’s apologist tweets.

Should we be surprised that the Clintons subsidized a Muslim Brotherhood operative? Not really.

As Andy McCarthy has pointed out, during Hillary Clinton’s time as Secretary of State:

[T]he United States. . .aligned itself with the Muslim Brotherhood in myriad ways. To name just a few (the list is by no means exhaustive): Our government reversed the policy against formal contacts with the Brotherhood; funded Hamas; continued funding Egypt even after the Brotherhood won the elections; dropped an investigation of Brotherhood organizations in the U.S. that were previously identified as co-conspirators in the case of the Holy Land Foundation financing Hamas; hosted Brotherhood delegations in the United States; issued a visa to a member of the Islamic Group (a designated terrorist organization) and hosted him in Washington because he is part of the Brotherhood’s parliamentary coalition in Egypt. . . .

Clinton’s closest confidante is Huma Abedin. The Abedin family has connections with the Muslim Brotherhood. Abedin herself may or may not. But her contempt for American Jews who support Israel is now a matter of record.

It won’t be new to have a Muslim Brotherhood fan in the Oval Office; we’ve had one for the past eight years. Fortunately, Team Obama didn’t have its way in Egypt and so the Muslim Brotherhood lost power.

It hasn’t gone away, however, and we should expect Hillary Clinton once again to back this anti-American, Israel-hating terrorist outfit."
100804,1009,TRUMP’S REFUSAL TO COMMIT TO “ACCEPTING” DEFEAT — SOME HISTORICAL PERSPECTIVE,http://www.powerlineblog.com/archives/2016/10/trumps-refusal-to-commit-to-accepting-defeat-some-historical-perspective.php,29,"Ignorance and anti-Trump bias continue to prevail in the denunciations of Donald Trump’s statement that he doesn’t know yet whether he will “accept” the result of the presidential election. For example, Michael Gerson asserts that Trump’s lack of belief in the fairness of our electoral system “is disqualifying” in a presidential candidate.

Gerson notes that the fairness of our electoral system has been “hard-won through a long history of strife and courage.” But if the system has become unfair to a significant degree, the hard work will be undone unless those victimized by unfairness speak up.

The claim that Trump has broken faith with American tradition by not promising in advance to “accept” a loss would be news to Rutherford B. Hayes and Andrew Jackson. Throughout his term as president, Hayes was commonly referred to as “His Illegitimacy” because of the intense controversy that surrounded his victory in 1876. (Without getting into the weeds of that election, Hayes’ victory seemed unfair at the time. However, given the abuses against Blacks who wanted to vote Republican — the party of Hayes — in the key Southern states around which the electoral controversy centered, it may well be that Hayes would have won a completely fair election).

As for Jackson, if complaining about election unfairness is disqualifying, “Old Hickory” should never have been president. In 1824, he was denied the presidency when the election went to the House of Representatives. Four candidates had split the electoral vote. Jackson had a plurality, but lacked a majority.

In the House, Henry Clay, one of the four candidates, helped swing the election to John Quincy Adams who had run second, well behind Jackson in the popular vote. Adams went on the name Clay his Secretary of State.

Jackson and his followers cried “corrupt bargain” throughout the four unhappy years of Adams’ presidency. In the 1828 election, Jackson romped to victory over Adams.

I don’t think it has ever been established that Adams and Clay made a corrupt bargain, and there is reason to doubt that they did. In those days, the Secretary of State position usually went to the most prominent politician affiliated with the president’s party or faction (a tradition that was revived when President Obama made Hillary Clinton his Secretary of State). Henry Clay fit that description in 1825.

Moreover, Adams and Clay had worked together as diplomats. They spent well over a year (if my memory serves) in Belgium negotiating an end to the War of 1812.

To be clear, they didn’t spend the entire period negotiating. The British engaged in shameless stalling. During the down time, it is said that Adams and Clay saw each other only for a brief time each day — the time early in the morning when Adams rose to write in his journal and Clay returned to their hotel in Ghent after a night on the town.

Still, the two respected each other. Clay was the natural choice to be Adams’ Secretary of State without regard to the House election. Moreover, it may well have been that most members of the House simply preferred Adams to Jackson.

As for Trump, he erred politically by not stating categorically, as he did in the first debate, that he will accept the election result. But his refusal to say this was not the egregious offense against American democracy that his detractors make it out to be."
100805,1010,Trump sets his sights on a new target: Michelle Obama,https://thinkprogress.org/trump-sets-his-sights-on-a-new-target-michelle-obama-34f5c1bc2da4#.i564bpgnn,29,"During a rally on Friday, Donald Trump unloaded on Michelle and Barack Obama, calling them “babies” and “losers” and accusing them of spending too much time campaigning.
“We have a president, all he wants to do is campaign. His wife, all she wants to do is campaign,” Trump said. “And I see how much his wife likes Hillary. But wasn’t she [Michelle Obama] the one that originally started the statement, ‘If you can’t take care of your home, you can’t take care of the White House or country?’” Trump was referring to comments Michelle made in August 2007 during the primary race between her husband and Hillary Clinton. At an event in Chicago, Michelle said, “One of the things, the important aspects of this race, is role modeling what good families should look like. And my view is that if you can’t run your own house, you certainly can’t run the White House. Can’t do it.” Some interpreted Michelle’s remarks as taking a shot at Hillary’s marriage. But other speeches Michelle gave around the same time suggested she was actually just talking about how she and Barack raised their daughters. Barack denied that Michelle’s comment was directed at the Clintons, and Michelle’s spokesperson said, “The only family Mrs. Obama was talking about was the Obama family.”
Trump used Michelle’s 2007 comments to attack Clinton during the second presidential debate, saying, “I’ve gotten to see the commercials that they did on you. And I’ve gotten to see some of the most vicious commercials I’ve ever seen of Michelle Obama talking about you, Hillary.”
But as Politifact’s Louis Jacobson wrote, “Trump is wrong to imply that Michelle Obama’s criticism came in an ad her husband ran against Hillary Clinton. Instead, it came from an ad made by a pro-Trump super PAC. And the comments from Michelle Obama are somewhat oblique.” Jacobson concluded that Trump’s comment was false.
Michelle Obama has emerged as one of Hillary Clinton’s most effective surrogates. Last week, she delivered a powerful indictment of Trump’s misogyny, and earlier this month, she ridiculed Trump for whining about his “defective” mic during the first presidential debate.
Trump has generally steered clear of attacking Michelle. He actually praised her Democratic National Convention speech, calling it “excellent” and saying he thought “she did a very good job,” even though she spent much of it criticizing him.
Trump’s reluctance to go after Michelle might stem from her popularity. In August, a Gallup poll pegged her favorability at 64 percent, which is about 10 points higher than her husband’s. But by unloading on her on Friday, Trump indicated no attack will be off limits during the final weeks of the campaign."
100806,1010,Trump loyalist plans to send army of supporters to inner cities on election day,https://thinkprogress.org/roger-stone-trump-exit-poll-78929bae20e6#.s2q8rmgs1,29,"Roger Stone, Donald Trump’s one-time lobbyist, former campaign adviser, and “ultimate” loyalist, will deploy 1,300 supporters to minority-heavy precincts to ask them how they voted, he told the Guardian on Thursday.
Stone, a “professional dirty trickster” who in 2008 created an anti-Hillary Clinton organization with the sexist acronym “Citizens United Not Timid,” is also a notorious conspiracy theorist who frequently collaborates with “9/11 Truther” Alex Jones of Infowars. He has warned, despite a lack of any evidence, that Clinton plans to steal the election with voter fraud. According to the Guardian report, Stone plans to dispatch members of his Citizens for Trump to “600 different precincts in nine Democrat-leaning cities with large minority populations, a tactic branded highly irregular by experts, who suggested that organizers could potentially use the polling as a way to intimidate voters.”
These pro-Trump volunteers would conduct an “exit poll” of voters in Cleveland, Detroit, Philadelphia, Las Vegas, Milwaukee, Fort Lauderdale, Charlotte, Richmond, and Fayetteville, asking voters to reveal their (secret) ballot decisions after they voted. They idea is that if their answers do not match up with final results for those precincts, Stone would use that to buttress claims of a “rigged election.”
“To those who say that it would be un-American to challenge the election on the basis that it was rigged, I would argue it would be un-American to have evidence of that rigging and not challenge the election,” Stone explained.
Unlike real pollsters who are trained at exit polling, there is no reason to believe that Stone or his volunteers have any expertise in how to conduct a scientific poll. Moreover, even professionally done exit polls are often inaccurate. In 2004, exit polls suggested John Kerry would defeat George W. Bush and in 2000, exit polls showed Al Gore significantly ahead in Florida (where a number of his supporters were confused by their butterfly ballots and did not end up having their votes for him recorded).
The Republican National Committee, prohibited from intimidating minority voters with certain tactics by a decades-old, court-endorsed consent decree, asked its members this week to avoid participating in “ballot security” activities. But Stone, who is not officially connected to the party or the campaign, is not bound by that order.
Donald Trump has repeatedly claimed that heavily minority and Democratic cities were rife with voter fraud and has averred he might not accept the results on November 8_—_unless he wins."
100807,1010,Donald Trump turned a lighthearted charity event into a symphony of boos,https://thinkprogress.org/donald-trump-turned-a-lighthearted-charity-event-into-a-symphony-of-boos-2fdac2f2a660#.5ioym7vye,29,"The Al Smith Dinner, an annual charity event hosted by Archbishop of New York Timothy Dolan, takes on added significance every four years, when both presidential nominees typically take a break from their campaigning a few weeks before the election to rub elbows with New York City’s leaders and philanthropists and tell jokes at their opponent’s expense.
Normally, the guest list includes two political adversaries who disagree on the issues, but nevertheless remain civil and respectful of one another. Normally.
After a relatively flat start to his remarks—at one point he called his own jokes “corny”—Donald Trump abandoned humor altogether in favor of jabbing Hillary Clinton, to the dismay of the audience.
The boos and hisses from the crowd were relatively muted at first, but by the end of his speech, there was very little being held back. A trademark characteristic of Al Smith Dinner speeches is a willingness to laugh at oneself. In 2008, Barack Obama made fun of his physical appearance and his lack of humility. In 2012, Romney cracked wise about his wealth. Donald Trump’s biggest laugh line came at the expense of his own wife, and otherwise failed at self-deprecation.
For her part, Hillary Clinton’s speech largely reached for the low-hanging fruit, a plentiful bounty when talking about the Trump campaign.
“It’s amazing I’m up here after Donald,” she quipped. “I didn’t think he’d be okay with a peaceful transition of power,” referencing Trump’s threat that he might challenge the results of the election if he doesn’t win.
She attacked Trump’s questionable wealth too, perhaps the one subject that Trump is most sensitive about. “It is great, also, to see Mayor Bloomberg here. It’s a shame he’s not speaking tonight, I’m curious to hear what a billionaire has to say.”
But Clinton was also devastatingly biting at times. “We’ve got the Honorable Chuck Schumer, the Honorable Andrew Cuomo, the Honorable Mike Bloomberg, the Honorable Bill de Blasio, the Honorable Dave Dinkins, and so many other wonderful elected officials,” she said, motioning around the room. “And we have Rudy Giuliani.” Cameras caught Giuliani’s humorless face moments later.
Clinton also made subtle reference to Trump’s lurid history of sexual abuse allegations made against him, and his hatred and fear of immigrants.
“It’s always a special treat for me to be back in New York, a city that I love, and which I think truly embodies the best of America,” she said. “People look at the Statue of Liberty and they see a proud symbol of our history as a nation of immigrants, a beacon of hope for people around the world. Donald looks at the Statue of Liberty and sees a four. Maybe a five, if she loses the torch and tablet and changes her hair.”
It wasn’t all rosy for the Democratic nominee, though: she appeared to spend a great deal of the evening interpreting Donald Trump’s remarks to a confused Cardinal Dolan seated beside her."
100808,1001,"Donald Trump plans 100 days of bloody vengeance, promises to sue women who accused him",http://www.dailykos.com/stories/2016/10/22/1585691/-Donald-Trump-plans-100-days-of-bloody-vengeance-promises-to-sue-women-who-accused-him,30,"Donald Trump visited the site of the most memorable speech in American history on Saturday morning  to give a speech that in its way was also particularly memorable. Memorable partly for its darkness, over-the-top-invective, and warnings against zombie voters.

Trump, who has accused opponents of rigging the election against him, again raised the specter of voter fraud. He said — without evidence — that ""1.8 million dead people are registered to vote, and some of them are voting.""
But what Trump’s Gettysburg speech will be most remembered for is promises of sweet, sweet revenge. Billed as a “positive policy speech” with the “aim of putting controversy behind him and focusing on the actions of his first 100 days in office,” Trump instead rambled away from the TelePrompTer to rant about the system being rigged, about Hillary Clinton being a criminal somehow in cahoots with the FBI, and about the media “poisoning” American voters against him.

And it turned into promises to avenge himself against the media, against opponents and against those women brave enough to speak up about his past acts.

He also vowed to file lawsuits against the women who have accused him in recent weeks of inappropriate sexual behavior, saying: ""All of these liars will be sued after the election is over.""
As side notes, Trump promised to take away funding for climate change and make it easier to sue the media. Because what America apparently needs is lawsuits.

You may not remember that part of the Gettysburg Address where Lincoln said he’d jail his opponent and sue everyone who insulted him—because it wasn’t there. Trump made up for those omissions."
100809,1002,Donald Trump Promises Change in Gettysburg Speech: ‘Has to Come from Outside Our Very Broken System’,http://www.breitbart.com/2016-presidential-race/2016/10/22/donald-trump-promises-change-gettysburg-speech-change-come-outside-broken-system/,30,"Donald Trump addressed the nation from Gettysburg, Pennsylvania — not far from where President Lincoln delivered his famous address in 1863 — on Saturday afternoon, where he laid out his closing arguments ahead of the election in 17 days.
“President Lincoln served at at time of division like we’ve never seen before. It is my hope that we can look at his example to heal the divisions we are living through right now,” Trump stated, noting that he isn’t a politician. “When I saw the trouble our country was in, I knew I couldn’t stand by and watch any longer. Our country has been so good to me. I love our country and I felt I had to act.”

“Change has to come from outside our very broken system,” he added, touting that he is the candidate that can create change in Washington, D.C. He referenced a number of problems facing the country, including voter fraud — an issue Trump has discussed recently while on the campaign trail.

“According to Pew, there are 24 million voter registrations in the United States that are either invalid or significantly inaccurate,” Trump claimed.

He noted there are 1.8 million dead people registered to vote “and some of them are voting.” Trump also said that 2.8 million people are registered in more than one state to vote and that 14 percent of non-citizens are registered to vote.

“The system is also rigged because Hillary Clinton should have been precluded from running for the presidency of the United States, but the FBI and the Justice Department covered up her crimes,” Trump stated about his opponent, adding that Hillary Clinton is running against change. “There’s nothing better or stronger than the American character,” he declared, asking voters to rise above the noise from what he calls a rigged system and rigged media.

The Republican nominee laid out his plan for his first 100 days in office if he is to become President of the United States, listing six measures he plans to execute in order to clean up special interests and collusion in Washington, D.C.

The six measures include:

A constitutional amendment to impose term limits on Congress
A hiring freeze on federal employees in various areas of government
A requirement that for every new federal regulation, two existing regulations must be eliminated
A five-year ban on executive government workers becoming lobbyists after leaving public service
A ban on White House officials lobbying on behalf of a foreign government
A complete ban on foreign lobbyists raising money for American elections
Trump went on to discuss a variety of ways that he plans to change government spending, including canceling billions of dollars being sent to the United Nation’s climate change programs as well as canceling federal funding for sanctuary cities.

He promised an economic plan to benefit the American worker and tax reductions for the middle class.

The Republican nominee also touted his plan to restore government ethics, end Common Core education and illegal immigration, and repeal and replace Obamacare with health savings accounts.

Trump’s speech comes as two recent general election polls — LA Times/USC Tracking and IBD/TIPP Tracking — show him tied with Clinton."

During an appearance in Gettysburg, Pennsylvania, he vows to act on them in the first 100 days in office.

“On November Eighth, Americans will be voting for this 100-day plan to restore prosperity to our country, secure our communities, and honesty to our government,” Trump says. “This is my pledge to you and if we follow these steps we will once more have a government of, by and for the people and importantly we will make America great again. Believe me.”

Here is the list of the “Contract with the American Voter” policies detailed by Trump:

Propose a Constitutional Amendment to impose term limits on all members of Congress
Institute a hiring freeze on all federal employees to reduce federal workforce through attrition (exempting military, public safety, and public health)
Require for every new federal regulation, two existing regulations must be eliminated.
Institute a five year-ban on White House and Congressional officials becoming lobbyists after they leave government service
Create a lifetime ban on White House officials lobbying on behalf of a foreign government.
Institute a complete ban on foreign lobbyists raising money for American elections.
Announce intention to renegotiate NAFTA or withdraw from the deal under Article 2205.
Announce withdrawal from the Trans-Pacific Partnership.
Direct Secretary of the Treasury to label China a currency manipulator.
Direct the Secretary of Commerce and U.S. Trade Representative to identify all foreign trading abuses that unfairly impact American workers and direct them to use every tool under American and international law to end those abuses immediately.
Lift the restrictions on the production of $50 trillion dollars’ worth of job-producing American energy reserves, including shale, oil, natural gas and clean coal.
Lift the Obama-Clinton roadblocks and allow vital energy infrastructure projects, like the Keystone Pipeline, to move forward.
Cancel billions in payments to U.N. climate change programs and use the money to fix America’s water and environmental infrastructure.
Cancel every unconstitutional executive action, memorandum and order issued by President Obama.
Begin the process of selecting a replacement for Justice Scalia from one of the 20 judges on my list, who will uphold and defend the Constitution of the United States.
Cancel all federal funding to Sanctuary Cities.
Begin removing the more than 2 million criminal illegal immigrants from the country and cancel visas to foreign countries that won’t take them back.
Suspend immigration from terror-prone regions where vetting cannot safely occur. All vetting of people coming into our country will be considered extreme vetting.
Work with Congress on a Middle Class Tax Relief And Simplification Act.An economic plan designed to grow the economy 4% per year and create at least 25 million new jobs through massive tax reduction and simplification, in combination with trade reform, regulatory relief, and lifting the restrictions on American energy. The largest tax reductions are for the middle class. A middle-class family with 2 children will get a 35% tax cut. The current number of brackets will be reduced from 7 to 3, and tax forms will likewise be greatly simplified. The business rate will be lowered from 35 to 15 percent, and the trillions of dollars of American corporate money overseas can now be brought back at a 10 percent rate.
Work with Congress on a End The Offshoring ActEstablishes tariffs to discourage companies from laying off their workers in order to relocate in other countries and ship their products back to the U.S. tax-free.

Reforms will also include cutting the red tape at the FDA: there are over 4,000 drugs awaiting approval, and we especially want to speed the approval of life-saving medications.
Work with Congress on a Affordable Childcare and Eldercare Act.Allows Americans to deduct childcare and elder care from their taxes, incentivizes employers to provide on-side childcare services, and creates tax-free Dependent Care Savings Accounts for both young and elderly dependents, with matching contributions for low-income families.
Work with Congress on an End Illegal Immigration ActFully-funds the construction of a wall on our southern border with the full understanding that the country Mexico will be reimbursing the United States for the full cost of such wall; establishes a 2-year mandatory minimum federal prison sentence for illegally re-entering the U.S. after a previous deportation, and a 5-year mandatory minimum for illegally re-entering for those with felony convictions, multiple misdemeanor convictions or two or more prior deportations; also reforms visa rules to enhance penalties for overstaying and to ensure open jobs are offered to American workers first.
Work with Congress on a Restoring Community Safety Act.Reduces surging crime, drugs and violence by creating a Task Force On Violent Crime and increasing funding for programs that train and assist local police; increases resources for federal law enforcement agencies and federal prosecutors to dismantle criminal gangs and put violent offenders behind bars.

100811,1002,Stolen Elections? It Has Happened and Could Happen Again,http://www.breitbart.com/2016-presidential-race/2016/10/22/stolen-elections-happened-can-happen/,30,"It is well accepted by historians and biographers that Richard Nixon had ample ground for contesting the 1960 election results because of widespread vote fraud in Cook County, Illinois and several counties in Lyndon Johnson’s home state of Texas.
Nixon chose to not challenge the election–but not because of lack of evidence. He let it go because he feared it would tear the country apart. Well, that was then and this is now.

Barack Obama and his “transformative politics” have already torn the country apart. In 1960, turning the country over to John Kennedy was not selling America into socialist slavery and globalist cronyism. In 2016, the alternatives are starkly different.

Should anyone be surprised that Donald Trump will not allow Hillary Clinton’s army of fraudsters steal an election without a fight?

There are many different ways to steal an election. In the Jim Crow South, blacks were simply kept off the voter rolls by a combination of laws, threats and  intimidation. In the big cities of the North and Midwest in the 19th century, votes were simply bought and paid for by political machines. The guarantee of a secret ballot is not found in the original US Constitution; it developed a century later as one answer to the practice of vote-buying.

The Pew Center just last week published a report claiming there are 1.8 million dead people on the voter rolls, and another credible report puts the total of dead people and ineligible voters at more than 4 million. The question that arises from such startling information is a simple one. If our super-smart election officials have allowed such problems to accumulate for decades without fixing them– while all the time opposing a photo ID requirement for voting —  why should citizens have confidence they can weed out all the bogus votes from the honest ones on election day? There are other, more sophisticated forms of election fraud besides counting votes cast by dead people. One of the most insidious and morally repugnant is being used in 2016 by the Democratic party’s propaganda arm, the American mass media: vote suppression. The media are telling millions of Americans over and over, day in and day out, they need not bother to vote because Hillary Clinton has already won the election.

That is what Donald Trump means by a “rigged election.”

When only one possible outcome is considered legitimate because the challenger has been labeled by the unified voices of the established institutions as illegitimate, can it be called a fair election? When tens of millions of voters are derided, insulted and delegitimized  as racists, “deplorables,”  rednecks,” “gun nuts,” and islamophobes — not only by the establishment’s anointed candidate herself but by her surrogates in entertainment, education and business, it is fair to ask, where is the level playing field?

Meanwhile, back in Chicago, some of the old tricks are still in fashion, like voting machines that count ballots a particular way. In 2014, some voters at the Schaumburg Public Library saw touch-screen voting machines that counted votes as Democrat even if you voted for a Republican candidate. The local election official attributed the problem to a “calibration error.” The funny thing is, there were no machines found that miscount votes the other direction.

Across the nation, literally tens of millions of ballots are already in the mail and will be returned by mail, with the only security tool being signature verification. That verification is by an election judge who is given an average of three seconds to compare the signature accompanying the ballot to the one in an electronic record.

In Billings, Montana, police are investigating reports of ballots being stolen from apartment mail boxes. In thousands of apartment buildings and nursing homes, millions of mailed ballots await pick-up by their owners– or by a  ballot harvester who will gladly vote the ballot or offer assistance in filling out the ballot and then delivering it to a polling place.

Is widespread vote fraud built into all-mail balloting? Is speed of counting more important to election officials than accuracy? Can you spell, willful blindness?

Donald Trump has said he will accept a “clear outcome” but reserves the right to challenge vote fraud. Yet, he is still being slandered for even raising the possibility of a rigged election. Let me suggest a different outcome will yield a different set  of heroes and villains.

What if Trump gets to 270 Electoral College votes by carrying key Electoral College swing states including Florida, North Carolina, Nevada, Pennsylvania, Iowa, and Ohio. What if he repeats the Bush victory of 2000 by winning the Electoral College but loses the popular vote because of losing populous states like California and New York by wide margins? Will the progressives accept the election results as valid under our Constitution, or will there be massive riots and disruptions?

The 2016 election has been full of surprises from the beginning, and there may be on more surprise in store. It’s not really news that the establishment has attempted to rig the election against Trump from the beginning– both the media establishment and the Republican establishment. Yet, he has not only survived, he remains within three to five points of a majority vote in the dozen key states he needs for victory.

That’s why vote suppression is now the name of the game. For 16 months Trump has been dismissed as a hopeless loser. The truth is, three percentage points in any presidential poll is within the margin of error.   If every Trump enthusiast votes and those millions of votes are stacked up against the votes cast by a handful of Clinton enthusiasts, Trump will win.

Of course, we may still have to deal with a few thousand pesky voting machines that seem to have a mind of their own."
100812,1003,"Border Walls, Deportations And The Final Presidential Debate",http://www.huffingtonpost.com/donald-kerwin/border-walls-deportations_b_12600226.html?utm_hp_ref=politics,30,"Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump clashed sharply in their final debate before the November 8th election. Below are responses to three of Trump’s immigration claims and proposals during the debate and throughout his campaign. The answers matter since both candidates have vowed to pursue immigration reform in the early days of their administrations.

Trump: “[S]he wants to give amnesty, which is a disaster and very unfair to all the people that are waiting on line for many, many years.”

Immigration status is a fluid condition, with many undocumented people on a path to legal status at any point in time and many more who qualify for status under our current laws. Each year, previously undocumented persons make up a high percentage of new lawful permanent residents (LPRs). In addition, an estimated 4.4 million immigrants qualify for a visa, 97 percent of them based on a close family relationship to a US citizen or LPR. Rather than seeking to gain an advantage, these mostly undocumented immigrants languish in visa backlog lines, often “for many, many years,” even decades. Perhaps another 14 to 15 percent of the 10.9 million US undocumented population are potentially eligible for an immigration benefit or relief that would put them on a path to LPR status and citizenship, but they do not know it or cannot afford to pursue it. For them, immigration status is an access to justice issue. Finally, past “earned legalization” bills would not have allowed undocumented persons to “jump” ahead of persons who had been waiting for visas. Applicants would have been required to go to the back of the line and, under some proposals, to wait for more than a decade for a green card.

Trump: “We need strong borders.”

We have them. The undocumented population fell steadily between 2008 and 2014. Border apprehensions are at roughly one-fourth of their historic highs. A growing percentage of illegal border crossers are fleeing pervasive violence and individual persecution in the Northern Triangle states of Central America. They are refugees or fleeing refugee-like conditions. Others are seeking to reunify with family members in the United States. Neither group can be easily deterred from migrating. Moreover, as former DHS Secretary Michael Chertoff points out, fencing has value in certain heavy crossing areas near towns or highways, but in other places “makes no sense at all” and “doesn’t add any value.” In addition, most persons entering the undocumented population in recent years have overstayed their temporary visas, not crossed borders illegally. In short, additional fencing, much less 2,000 miles of it, does not respond to refugee-producing conditions, the separation of families, visa over-stayers, or the need for effective border policies.

“We’re going to get them [all] out.”

Rather than an exercise in upholding the rule of law, the deportation of nearly 11 million persons would require the law enforcement tactics of a police state. In addition, according to one study, the US would need to spend $400 and $600 billion in immigration enforcement over 20 years to accomplish this goal. The loss of this population would also shrink the US labor force by 6.4 percent, and the GDP by $1.6 trillion over 20 years. It would particularly decimate industries in which unauthorized laborers - which constitute more than 5 percent of the US workforce overall — are concentrated.

It would also devastate millions of American families. The undocumented population includes high and growing percentages of persons with long tenure and strong family and equitable ties to the United States, including 1.9 million who have lived in the US for 20 years or more, 1.6 million for 15 to 19 years, and 3.1 million for 10 to 14 years. There are 3.8 million undocumented immigrants with at least one US citizen or LPR child. If the concern is that unscrupulous employers use undocumented immigrants to depress wages and working conditions, the better solution would be to strengthen and enforce federal and state labor and workplace protection laws. We should also bring undocumented workers out of the shadows so they are able to exercise the rights and responsibilities of all workers.

In short, broad, integrated reform of the underlying legal immigration system, coupled with effective engagement of migrant sending states, would better address the challenges to which Trump’s largely symbolic and wholly untenable policy proposals seek to respond."
100813,1003,The Threat Of A Right-Wing Supreme Court: Analyzing Trump’s Prospective Justices,http://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/the-threat-of-a-right-wing-supreme-court-analyzing_us_580b7932e4b0f8715789fb3a?utm_hp_ref=politics,30,"As the media focuses on Donald Trump’s sexually predatory behavior and Hillary Clinton’s Wall Street speeches, the future of the Supreme Court has received only an occasional mention. During the final presidential debate, the topic was finally given some attention.

When asked about late-term abortion, Clinton said Roe v. Wade “very clearly sets out that there can be regulations on abortion so long as the life and the health of the mother is taken into account.” Trump responded with the incendiary retort, “If you go with what Hillary is saying, in the 9th month, you can take the baby and rip the baby out of the womb of the mother just prior to the birth of the baby.”

What Trump was actually describing was a C-section, which would result in the birth of a live baby.

An examination of how the two candidates’ judicial nominees would likely vote on critical issues the high court will face reveals the enormous stakes in the upcoming presidential election.

Trump and Clinton’s choices for Supreme Court justices could not be more philosophically dissimilar.

While Clinton has not provided names, she has stated that she will nominate justices who will uphold abortion rights, women’s rights, workers’ rights, voting rights, marriage equality and affordable health care; provide relief for DREAMers and the parents of US citizens and lawful permanent residents; and overturn Citizens United.

Trump has vowed to nominate justices in the mold of Antonin Scalia. The late justice favored unlimited corporate election spending. He opposed reproductive rights, universal health care, same-sex marriage, affirmative action, voting rights, immigrants’ rights, labor rights, LGBTQ rights and environmental protection. Scalia wrote the decision that concluded, for the first time, that the Second Amendment grants each individual (rather than “a well-regulated militia”) the right to bear arms.

Trump indicated his intent to change the law through his judicial appointments, to overturn Roe v. Wade and “allow the states to protect the unborn.”

After consulting with the right-wing Federalist Society and Heritage Foundation, Trump released lists of names from which he intends to select his judicial nominees. Their writings and judicial decisions demonstrate open hostility toward reproductive rights, affordable health care, consumer protections, criminal defendants, voting rights, workplace safety and LGBTQ rights.

The Future of the Supreme Court Hangs in the Balance

The Court is evenly divided, 4-4, between liberals and conservatives. Scalia’s vacant seat will be filled by the next president. Three of the current justices are 78 or older. That means, if the new president serves two terms, he or she will likely nominate three or four justices to the Court.

If Clinton is elected, she would restore a liberal majority to the Court for the first time since 1969. “For the first time in decades, there is now a realistic chance that the Supreme Court will become an engine of progressive change rather than an obstacle to it,” Jeffrey Toobin wrote in the New Yorker.

Many white evangelicals, whose primary goals are outlawing abortion and same-sex marriage, understand this well. That is why, in an effort to keep a conservative Supreme Court, most of them will still vote for Trump, notwithstanding the almost daily groping allegations emerging against him. If progressives refuse to vote for Clinton and Trump wins, the negative fallout will affect the lives of people in this country for decades.

Trump’s Judges

“Collectively, these individuals reflect a radical-right ideology that threatens fundamental rights and legal protections, and that favors the powerful and privileged over everyday Americans, especially those from historically marginalized communities,” according to the Alliance for Justice. “The list has very little diversity, with only three women, no people of color, and no one who has worked as a public defender or civil rights attorney.”

Here is a sampling of Trump’s prospective judges’ records on reproductive rights, workers’ rights, discrimination and voting rights, guns, criminal procedure, environmental rights and the death penalty:

Reproductive Rights

William H. Pryor, Jr., a judge on the Eleventh Circuit Court of Appeals, calledRoe v. Wade one of “the worst examples of judicial activism,” saying that “seven members of [the Supreme Court] swept aside the laws of the fifty states and created _ out of thin air _ a constitutional right to murder an unborn child.”

Steven Colloton, a judge on the Eighth Circuit, joined the only circuit court opinion to rule that the Affordable Care Act’s birth control accommodation for religious non-profit organizations (religious colleges and hospitals) creates a substantial burden on religious practices.

Raymond Gruender, also of the Eighth Circuit, wrote that employers who deny contraception coverage (except for purposes like hormone regulation) don’t violate the Pregnancy Discrimination Act. Gruender also authored two opinions holding that a state can pass a law requiring a woman to sign a statement that says “the abortion will terminate the life of a whole, separate, unique, living human being” and “the pregnant woman has an existing relationship with that unborn human being.”

Thomas Lee, of the Utah Supreme Court, wrote that a fetus is a “child” under Utah’s wrongful death statute.

Diane Sykes, of the Seventh Circuit, wrote that the Affordable Care Act’s mandate to provide contraceptive coverage “substantially burdens” the religious practice of for-profit corporations (later endorsed by a divided Supreme Court in Burwell v. Hobby Lobby).

Neil M. Gorsuch and Timothy M. Tymkovich, of the Tenth Circuit, agreed in the circuit court decision in Hobby Lobby that corporations are persons exercising religion for purposes of the Religious Freedom Restoration Act. Tymkovich also argued that Colorado could deny Medicaid funding to poor women who seek abortions resulting from rape or incest.

Charles Canady, of the Florida Supreme Court, popularized the term “partial-birth abortion.” When he was a congressman, Canady wrote a bill, later vetoed by President Bill Clinton, severely limiting a woman’s right to abortion.

Workers’ Rights

Steven Colloton wrote two decisions that, together, reversed $24 million in awards to workers for unrecorded time putting on and taking off work equipment, in violation of the Fair Labor Standards Act.

Raymond Kethledge, of the Sixth Circuit, upheld an anti-union Michigan law that targeted public school employees for retaliation if they opposed anti-union legislation.

Discrimination and Voting Rights

William H. Pryor, Jr. signed an opinion stating that a supervisor’s use of the word “boy” directed at an African American employee was just “conversational” and one of some “ambiguous stray remarks” unrelated to employment decisions. Pryor often dissents from decisions upholding relief for plaintiffs who allege discrimination, including a case in which a woman alleged retaliatory firing for claiming sexual harassment after being fired by the manager she accused of misconduct. He has also upheld discriminatory voter ID laws that disenfranchise minority voters, and protected large corporations from paying punitive damages.

Diane Sykes reinstated Wisconsin’s voter ID law even after a trial court found it “results in the denial or abridgment of the right to vote on account of race or color.” She also defended the right of anti-gay groups to receive government subsidies, and forced Southern Illinois University to recognize the Christian Legal Society as a student organization even though it prohibited gay students from being voting members or serving in leadership positions.

Timothy M. Tymkovich said that local ordinances prohibiting discrimination based on sexual orientation gave “special rights” to LGBTQ people.

Robert Young, of the Michigan Supreme Court, upheld Michigan’s voter ID law, saying it was “nondiscriminatory.”

Charles Canady, as a congressman, voted for the Defense of Marriage Act (banning same-sex marriage for federal law purposes).

Guns

Diane Sykes wrote an opinion overturning a ban on firing ranges within city limits.

Timothy M. Tymkovich opposed Denver’s efforts to restrict assault weapons.

Thomas Hardiman, of the Third Circuit, wrote that New Jersey could not require people to demonstrate a “justifiable need” for a gun before being issued a license to carry a handgun in public.

Criminal Procedure

William H. Pryor, Jr. said that Miranda v. Arizona, which held that police must advise suspects in custodial interrogation of their rights to remain silent and to an attorney, was one of the “worst examples of judicial activism.”

Thomas Hardiman wrote two opinions allowing correctional officers to conduct strip searches of inmates accused of minor offenses.

Environmental Rights

Timothy M. Tymkovich limited the ability of environmental groups to stop corporations from inflicting environmental harm.

William H. Pryor, Jr. took anti-environmental positions during his tenure as Alabama Attorney General.

The Death Penalty

Steven Colloton wrote an opinion prohibiting prisoners from learning the identities of the physician, laboratory and pharmacy involved in carrying out Missouri’s execution protocol.

Charles Canady voted to uphold a death sentence, later overturned by the Supreme Court, with even Chief Justice Roberts and Justices Scalia and Thomas concluding that Florida’s sentencing law was unconstitutional.

The Stakes Could Not Be Higher

This election will not simply determine the Supreme Court’s resolution of important issues for the next four years. The new president will change the Court’s ideological makeup for the next four decades. Its decisions will affect workers, consumers, immigrants, voters, people of color, LGBTQ rights, taxpayers, reproductive rights, affirmative action, health care, criminal defendants, guns and the environment. That includes all of us. Progressives should ponder this reality as they decide if and how to cast their votes."
100814,1003,"Hate Crime In U.S. Survey Up 6 Percent; But Anti-Muslim Rise 89 Percent, NYC Up 24 Percent So Far In 2016",http://www.huffingtonpost.com/brian-levin-jd/hate-crime-in-us-survey-u_b_12600232.html?utm_hp_ref=politics&ir=Politics,30,"New National Data From 21 States Shows Hate Crime Up
Our recent 20-state study, released last month, and to be presented at the American Society of Criminology next month, found small overall hate crime increases punctuated by significant spikes that vary by location, offense type, significant event dates and targeted group. The data relied primarily and preferably on official law enforcement figures.

Since the report was published we have new official police data from Maryland, one of the nation’s most diverse states, with one of the highest percentages of Jews, Muslims and African-Americans. Maryland was also the first state in the nation to systematically record hate crime statistics. This updated 21-state data is presented for the first time here in The Huffington Post. Final national hate crime figures from the FBI are expected late next month.

Twenty One U.S. State Annual Change by Group For 2015 : Update of Special Status Report 1. Due to limited availability of data, the analysis of Anti-Arab hate crimes in the U.S. only includes 10 U.S. states. The limited availability of the data is due to this being a new hate crime data category by the FBI and in many areas of the U.S.
2. The analysis of Anti-Black hate crimes in the U.S were drawn from a sample of 12 larger U.S. states that had at least 100 or more incidents in at least one of the last two years.
3. The sample of data used for analyzing anti-White hate crimes was only the 12 larger U.S. states referenced above. 
4. Similar to anti-Black and anti-White hate crime data, this sample only included 12 larger U.S. states.
5. Due to this being a newer category, the analysis of gender/transgender hate crimes was only drawn from 9 U.S. states.
* Since report published updated data for 21 states and partial DC data show an increase in anti-Muslim hate crime from 114 to 213 in 2015 for an increase of 86.8%. Full Sept. Report Available.

Anti-Muslim Hate Crimes Soar to Post-2001 Record, But Jews Targeted More 
Overall small increases hid significant spikes in bias crimes against Muslims, Arabs and transgender people in 2015, with hate crimes against Muslims rising 89 percent, statistically breaking out of range of between 105 and 160 in the years since 9/11. In our 21-state sample of official law enforcement data there were 210 anti-Muslim hate crimes, which we cautiously expect to rise up to 280 nationwide when the FBI releases its data next month. Because the District of Columbia only sent partial overall data, we did not include three anti-Muslim hate crimes reported there in our tally. Applying the overall increase of 5.96 percent in 2015 found in the 21 states we surveyed to last year’s FBI total of 5,479 incidents, we expect the final official FBI data total to be around 5,806, although we urge caution for our extrapolated estimates.

Jews, however, are still by far the most frequent target of religious hate crime, constituting 548 incidents or 12.6 percent of all hate crime in our sample, but anti-Jewish crimes have been in a period of overall decline — about 40 percent over the last decade, despite a 3.6 percent increase in our sample for last year. Nonetheless, the Anti-Defamation League, a Jewish civil rights group, in a prior report found a disturbing increase in 2015 in assaults as well as campus incidents. Still, the precipitous increase in Muslim hate crimes, for such a small group, about one percent of the population, resulted in Muslims not only increasing in the aggregate, but as a proportion of hate crime targets, up from 2.66 percent in 2014 of all hate crime to 4.83 percent in 2015 in our 21-state study.

What’s Behind the Increase in Anti-Muslim Hate Crime?
What is behind the spike in anti-Muslim hate crimes? While the data is not as diagnostic or predictive as some would suggest, we can at least isolate certain relevant developments that took place during this period where attitudes were possibly impacted. These include elevated levels of prejudice and fear directed against Muslims domestically, highly publicized terror attacks and bigoted pronouncements by violent Salafist Jihadist extremists directed at Americans and Europeans, and the coalescence of populist socio-political movements in the West that lean toward Euro-Nationalist identity and away from greater international engagement in such things as existing trade agreements to immigration.

As a series of violent escalating Salafist jihadist terrorist attacks and plots hit Europe, and the United States, a brutal civil war reverberated beyond Syria’s borders last year. Horrendous pronouncements and videos by Daesh or ISIS, a group overwhelmingly rejected by Muslims in international social surveys, were widely publicized in the United States. The comprehensive and controversial nuclear agreement with Iran in July 2015, as well as its incarceration of an American reporter and others also garnered headlines. As the election season commenced, immigration and national security often took center stage, with discourse frequently shifting towards Muslims collectively, and often, regrettably, with the invocation of incendiary negative stereotypes. These stereotypes help amplify where prejudice is directed communally within various subgroups, where certain out groups are negatively characterized. Stereotypes are over-generalizations, usually negative, about a group; that people respond to across a range of behaviors going from degradation and social isolation to aggression.

With respect to Muslims, however, prejudice has been elevated for the better part of a decade. Muslims have been either the most negatively viewed, or among the top few socially recognized groups that are negatively categorized, with the most recent study released in August’s Social Forces journal having them top that list. In 2014, before the current election season, Pew research also found that Muslims were the least positively viewed religious groups.

Ignorance about the Islamic faith and its heterogeneity, coupled with a lack of meaningful interaction with peaceful Muslim neighbors, allows publicity about real events and the significant threat posed by a minority of violent fanatical extremists to skew attitudes towards Muslim-Americans as a whole. Economists call this phenomenon availability and unfamiliar event heuristics, where misperceptions and fears about the risk, frequency and causes of events come to frame an inaccurate understanding of them and their context. In this time of sustained heightened prejudice against Muslims, spikes in hate crimes can accompany catalytic events, like terrorist attacks. The phenomenon of catalytic events being followed by additional increases in hate crimes has been documented for decades and includes such incidents as the Rodney King beating case, state court verdicts, and the 9/11 attacks.

Is there a Trump or Bush Effect?
More specifically, our research found that well-publicized statements by political leaders after terrorist attacks were also followed by dramatic shifts in reported hate crimes. Data from the FBI’s National Incident-Based Reporting System, collected by Center board member James Nolan, revealed that for the 22 jurisdictions participating there were 77 anti-Muslim hate crimes for the six days from September 12 (none were registered for September 11) through September 17, 2001; the day of the President George W. Bush’s mosque address on tolerance, including 15 on that day.

For the six days that followed, anti-Muslim hate crimes dipped to 26, dropping down to five on September 18, the day after the president’s address. Because we do not know the times of the hate crimes on September 17, 2001, one may want to calculate the data by making the dividing line the day before, thus going from September 12 through the September 16, for a total of 62, and shifting the 15 over into a new cadre of incidents going until September 21, for a total of 33. If we choose the first data set, the decline for the days after President Bush’s speech the drop is 66.2 percent, and if we choose the second set, the declines are still steep, at 46.7 percent.

In contrast, five days after the December 2, 2015 San Bernardino terrorist attack Republican Candidate Donald Trump tweeted an announcement of a proposed ban on all Muslims entering the United States at 1:47 p.m. ET and reiterated his position during a lengthy speech at a rally in the evening, all of which received extensive media attention. The San Bernardino terrorist attack occurred at about 11 a.m. PT, on December 2, but the names of the suspects were not initially released, and suspicions of an indirect connection to ISIS were not definitively confirmed in the media until December 4. For the five days from December 2 through December 6, there were 8 anti-Muslim hate crimes, with none on December 2. For the five days from December 7 through December 11, there were 15 anti-Muslim hate crimes, an 87.5 percent increase with those occurring on December 7 taking place after the announcement. These crimes include multiple assaults and two fire-bombings, including one in the overnight hours immediately following Mr. Trump’s announcement. In total there were 45 anti-Muslim hate crimes from November 13, 2015 (the day of the Paris terror attacks) through December 13, 2015. The monthly average for the previous five years is 12.6. This correlation will be heavily researched by our Center in the months to come. For this analysis our Center used official and unofficial data we collected on our own applying FBI and model penal code standards to replicate as close as possible national reporting standards under the supervision of former municipal and federal law enforcement with vast experience in hate crime data collection.

NYC 2016 Year to Date: Hate Crime Up Over Same Period in 2015 NYPD statistics released to our Center revealed that year-to-date 2016 (through October 16), there was a 24 percent increase in hate crimes overall in the city. These criminal incidents rose from 229 for the period in 2015, to 284 so far in 2016. Anti-Muslim hate crime doubled during that period. New York City anti-Muslim hate crimes for the year to date period rose from 12 in 2015 to 24 so far this year; while anti-gay crimes rose from 58 to 86, a 48.3 percent increase. Anti-Semitic crimes are unchanged so far this year, at 95. Anti-Asian, Anti-African-American, and Anti-Latinos hate crimes all fell sharply so far in 2016.

Interestingly, the large spike seen in 2015 for anti-Muslim hate crime for much of the rest of the country, was delayed until 2016 for New York City. Anti-Muslim hate crime dropped by a single incident or 4.4 percent in the city during 2015, while partial national data of 21 states saw anti-Muslim hate crimes rise by 89 percent that year.

New York City, however, is one of only a handful of jurisdictions with 2016 hate crime data. In contrast to the hate crime increase in the city, an index of all major (primarily non-hate crime) felonies in the city declined 3.06 percent year to date through (October 2, 2016) in comparison with 2015. If current trends continue at the same rate New York City will see 350 hate crimes in the metropolis in 2016, for an overall increase of 13.3 percent with a more pronounced rise in anti-Muslim hate crime of 31.8 percent or 29 incidents. It’s simply too early to draw broad conclusions from one large city. As we get more data in, we’ll be able to determine whether New York’s increases are representative, but large diverse jurisdictions are not always. In 2015, California, for example, showed both much larger overall increases than the national average, as well as significant increases not only against Muslims, but large increases in anti-Latino and anti-Semitic incidents that were not replicated across our total sample. 

According to the Census Bureau, New York City is one of the most diverse jurisdictions in the nation, with 33 percent non-Hispanic whites, 29 percent Latino, 26 percent African-American and 13 percent Asian residents. Jews account for 1.1 million of New York City’s 8.5 million residents and 13 percent of all Jews in America live there according to Pew Research. The city is 59 percent Christian, 33 percent Catholic; 3 percent Muslim and 3 percent Hindu according to Pew. 

2015 Hate Crime Data for City and State  New York City saw a slight decline of 2.3 percent, with incidents dropping from 309 in 2014, to 302 last year. New York State as a whole continued a multi-year decline in hate crime in 2015, with an even larger drop of 9.9 percent. New York City accounted for 61 percent of the state’s hate crime in 2015. New York City suburbs of Long Island and Westchester accounted for another 23.5 percent of the state’s hate crime in 2015.

Brooklyn, the city’s most populous borough with 2,636,735 residents, led the city in hate crimes with 117 in 2015 or 23 percent of the state’s total and over 35 percent of the city’s total, followed by Manhattan with 104 according to the NYPD. New York State is home to the largest number of Jews, 1.759 million; and the highest percentage of Jewish residents at 8.9 percent of any state in the union. Statewide there was a continued multiyear decline in anti-Semitic the crimes. For 2015 anti-Jewish crimes dropped in the state 12.6 percent from 235 to 206 for 2015 over 2014; while anti-Muslim crime rose 37.5 percent from 24 to 33 incidents. These changes are a decline in contrast to our national data. Even so Jews remain the most targeted faith group for hate crime both nationally and in New York, which is home to 25 percent of the nation’s Jews. The overall increase for all hate crime in that survey showed an overall increase of 6 percent. 

New York City’s Hate Crime Task Force is the largest and second oldest of any hate crime unit in the United States, and the city began collecting data in 1980.

100815,1004,Trump On First 100 Days: I Will Sue ‘Liars’ Who Accused Me Of Assault,http://talkingpointsmemo.com/livewire/donald-trump-threatens-sue-accusers-after-election,30,"Donald Trump declared that he was “looking forward” to suing every woman who has accused him of groping and assault during a Saturday speech laying out his plan for the first 100 days of his presidency.

“All of these liars will be sued after the election,” Trump claimed, alleging that the 10 women who have so far accused him of unwanted advances came forward “to hurt my campaign.”

The Trump team billed the speech, held in Gettysburg, Pennsylvania in honor of Abraham Lincoln’s address, as an opportunity to lay out his top priorities.

Accusing the media and Clinton campaign of recruiting his accusers to smear his reputation, Trump said the stories of “these liars” were told with “virtually no fact checking whatsoever.”

“We’ll find out about their involvement at a later date through litigation,” Trump charged.

“I’m looking so forward to doing that,” the Republican nominee told the approving crowd.

A number of women went public with stories of Trump groping their body without consent, forcibly kissing them, and engaging in other inappropriate behavior in the days after he declared at the second presidential debate that he had never sexually assaulted anyone. The denial came after a recording leaked in which Trump boasted about using his celebrity status to “do anything” he wanted to women, including grabbing them “by the pussy.”"
100816,1004,Trump Tests New Pitch: Mexico Will ‘Reimburse’ Us For The Wall,http://talkingpointsmemo.com/livewire/trump-now-says-mexico-reimburse-united-states-wall,30,"Donald Trump explained Saturday that his signature campaign promise to have Mexico pay for a new massive border wall was really more of a request for a refund.

Proposing a new piece of legislation called the “End Illegal Immigration Act,” the Republican nominee told a crowd in Gettysburg, Pennsylvania that Mexico would “reimburse” the U.S. for the cost.

“The End Illegal Immigration act fully funds the construction of a wall on our southern border,” he said in a speech laying out his vision for the first 100 days of a Trump presidency.

“Don’t worry about it,” he cautioned the crowd in an aside, holding up a finger. “Remember I said that Mexico is paying for the wall.”

An audience member whooped.

“With the full understanding that the country of Mexico will be reimbursing the United States for the full cost of such a wall, okay?” Trump continued, to a more muted cheer.

If elected, Trump would need to persuade Congress to draft a law to fund his proposal. The Republican nominee has promised that the cost for the “big, beautiful” 50-foot structure would not cost more than $12 billion dollars. Fact-checkers have put forth higher estimates, ranging up to $25 billion.

Mexican president Enrique Peña-Nieto has also insisted that his country would not cover the cost of the wall. After Trump told reporters the two did not discuss payment during his impromptu visit to Mexico, Peña Nieto said he made it “very clear” to the Republican nominee that Mexico would “never” pay for it.

100817,1004,Pennsylvania GOP Files Federal Lawsuit To Allow Out-Of-County Poll Watchers,http://talkingpointsmemo.com/livewire/pennsylvania-gop-federal-lawsuit-out-of-county-poll-watchers,30,"The Pennsylvania Republican Party filed a complaint late Friday night asking a federal court to allow out-of-county poll watchers to monitor voting stations on Election Day.

Filed on behalf of eight Keystone State voters, the suit alleges that state law restricting poll watchers to the county in which they’re registered violates the First Amendment and denies them their right to equal protection under the law.

Donald Trump has raised unfounded fears that the Nov. 8 election will be “rigged” by illegitimate ballots cast by undocumented immigrants, people voting multiple times, and “dead people.” All of them, he claims, will vote for Hillary Clinton.

He has called on his supporters to go “watch” voters in “certain areas” to ensure no fraud is committed, directing them to communities with large black populations like Philadelphia and Chicago.

Elections experts and secretaries of state have condemned his comments as dangerous and untrue, noting that voter fraud is extraordinarily rare. Invalid voter registrations are typically the result of outdated record-keeping rather than willful fraud.

Still, Republican Party of Pennsylvania GOP Communications Director Megan Sweeney told the Morning Call that the state party’s federal suit was simple “a commonsense remedy to ensure the fairest election possible.”

University of California law professor Rick Hasen, who runs the Election Law Blog, noted the “awfully late” date of the suit in a Friday post and said the U.S. Constitutional issues at hand seem “exceptionally weak.”

“The argument is that the failure to allow some voters within the state to serve as poll watchers violates equal protection, due process and First Amendment speech rights,” Hasen wrote. “I have never seen such an argument not extended to the act of voting, but to the act of watching at the polls.”

“I cannot see how this severely burdens voters’ rights,” Hasen continued, saying he doesn’t think the federal arguments “have much of a chance of going anywhere.”

A spokesman for Pennsylvania Gov. Tom Wolf (D) concurred, calling the suit baseless.”

“It is shameful that the Pennsylvania Republican Party has joined Donald Trump in his dangerous claims of widespread voter fraud in Pennsylvania,"" spokesman Jeff Sheridan told the Morning Call, accusing the GOP of “trying to cause chaos and disruption.""

The suit was filed in Federal District Court for the Eastern District of Pennsylvania against the Keystone State’s Secretary of State Pedro A. Cortes, a Democrat.

""Every woman lied when they came forward to hurt my campaign,” Trump claimed. ""Total fabrication, the events never happened—never. All of these liars will be sued after the election is over.""

Trump's threat came during a speech in Gettysburg, Pennsylvania, which was plugged as a major policy speech to lay out his first 100 days in office should he win the election next month. His promise to sue his accusers wasn't the only notable moment.

While taking a hard line on his accusers, he seems to be softening on a key campaign promise: That the US will build a wall along its southern border and that Mexico will pay for it. Now, according to his speech, his position is that the United States will pay for the wall but Mexico will reimburse the US. Trump also promised to break up Comcast and NBC as part of a response to media bias against him during the campaign."

“Every woman lied when they came forward to hurt my campaign,” Trump said, adding, “Total fabrication. The events never happened. Never.” “All of these liars will be sued after the election is over,” Trump said to applause and cheers from the audience.

A bit later in the speech Trump added, “It was probably the DNC and the Clinton campaign that put forward these liars with their fabricated stories, but we’ll find out about their involvement at a later date through litigation, and I look so forward to doing that.” Trump’s statement about suing his accusers was actually part of a longer segment of his speech in which he argued that the media was too powerful. He cited the attempt by AT&T to buy Time Warner saying it was, “a deal we would not approve in my administration because it’s too much concentration of power in the hands of too few.” After listing a couple of similar examples Trump added, “Deals like this destroy democracy.” He connected the power of the media to the accusations made against him saying, “A simple phone call placed to the biggest newspapers or television networks gets them wall-to-wall coverage with virtually no fact-checking whatsoever.”"
100820,1006,Oprah reminds everyone to vote for Hillary… even if you don’t like her very much,http://hotair.com/archives/2016/10/22/oprah-reminds-everyone-vote-hillary-even-dont-like-much/,30,"Seeing Hollywood jump in on the side of the Democrats is roughly as surprising as children voting to have cake for breakfast and this season is no exception. But unlike Katy Perry (who seems to be completely enthralled with the top of the ticket) some of the entertainment industry’s high profile talent is a bit less than enthusiastic when it comes to Hillary Clinton. Take for example Oprah Winfrey. The extremely wealthy television star was always on deck to work the convention and support the ticket, but while out stumping for Clinton she seems to be a bit more “realistic” about the product she’s pushing this time. In fact, at one of her most recent appearances she came out and admitted that her target audience might not be particularly fond of the candidate but they should vote for her anyway. (America Rising)

Oprah has an inspiring new message for undecided voters thinking about voting for Hillary Clinton, “You don’t have to like her.” Oprah’s inability to go much further than that in support of Clinton is just the latest indication of how unpopular the Democratic nominee is.

Oprah’s tepid support for Clinton stands starkly in contrast with her support for Obama eight years ago. Back then she said that Obama had “a new vision for America,” and that she believed in him personally.
This uncomfortable admission comes from an interview she did with Dallas-based pastor T.D. Jakes which will be airing next week. The video provides all the context you need. It’s not that Oprah dislikes Hillary Clinton herself, you see… it’s just that a lot of other people might. But she explains why that’s not a problem. Here’s the video and the pearls of wisdom she casts before the undecided swine. “She’s not coming over to your house! You don’t have to like her,” she said. “You don’t have to like her. Do you like this country? Do you like this country? You better get out there and vote. Do you like the country? Do you like freedom and liberty? Do you like this country? OK. Do you like democracy or do you want a demagogue?”
See? There’s nothing to worry about. She’s not coming over to your house. Of course, she will be going to the White House, but why let a little thing like that bother you? At least you won’t have to listen to her prattling on during dinner and you can always turn off the television if she is.

Oprah landed at 21st on Forbes’ list of most powerful and influential women this year, well behind Hillary Clinton. (Who still came in at number two, behind Angela Merkel.) Perhaps it’s this sort of pragmatic salesmanship which propelled her to initial success. Unfortunately, unlike her now legendary book of the month club, Winfrey has a considerably less popular product to hawk this time."
100821,1006,Texas court reaffirms injunction on Obama transgender mandates,http://hotair.com/archives/2016/10/22/texas-court-reaffirms-injunction-obama-transgender-mandates/,30,"The Great Bathroom Wars of the 21st century are back on hold as of this week. Ever since Barack Obama issued executive mandates earlier this year dictating that schools and federal facilities must allow men in women’s bathrooms, locker rooms and showers if they “identify” as females, more than a dozen states have been in open revolt against the orders. A Texas court had previously issued an injunction barring the rules from going into effect and on Tuesday that order was affirmed yet again by U.S. District Judge Reed O’Connor in Austin, Texas. As expected, the White House is moving to appeal the decision. (Star-Telegram)

The Obama administration on Thursday filed notice that it will appeal a Texas federal judge’s ruling that temporarily blocked new federal guidelines directing public schools to accommodate transgender students, including allowing them to use bathrooms that align with their gender identity.

Federal officials say they will ask the U.S. 5th Circuit Court of Appeals to overturn a preliminary injunction issued by Fort Worth-based U.S. District Judge Reed O’Connor. On Tuesday, O’Connor reaffirmed that his ruling blocking the guidelines applied nationwide, not just in the 13 states that filed suit against the federal government.

O’Connor issued the original ruling in August on the same day millions of Texas children headed back to school, preventing the federal government from enforcing the guidelines as the case went through the courts.
Advocates of traditional privacy considerations might find this to be a victory, but it’s important to note that this ruling does nothing to address the underlying questions regarding “gender identity” or the legality of the White House mandates. This was strictly a procedural ruling on Judge O’Connor’s part. He specified that there were issues with the fact that the White House “had not followed proper rule-making procedure” when issuing the order and that the courts would need to weigh in on the underlying questions of propriety.

On the plus side, it was also reaffirmed that this decision applied to the entire country, not just the 13 states currently challenging the President in court. That means that not only can’t the rules be enforced in federal buildings, but that schools can not have their federal funding held hostage for failing to comply with this new, highly distorted “evolution” of Title IX. That’s an important issue because this sort of federal blackmail process could have forced many schools into an untenable position.

What we really need from the courts – and most likely the Supreme Court sooner rather than later – is a two part ruling. First there is the legal jargon question as to whether or not the definition of “sex” when applied to allegations of discrimination can be unilaterally expanded to include “gender identity” at the whim of the White House. But before the courts can speak to that it seems that they will have to get off the fence and declare whether or not “gender” is something which can be separated from person’s biological sex in defiance of science. If they agree to that premise than all hope is essentially lost because the silliness of these Social Justice Warrior fights over political correctness run amok will have infected the system at the highest levels.

For now we continue to wait. And until the final seat on the Supreme Court is filled we may not even see the question taken up."

Many Congressional Republicans pulled back their support for the GOP nominee in the aftermath, and certain polls show the decade-old gaffe hurt him bigly.

But the double standard by the media is astounding.

Trump can say that women let him get away with being sexually aggressive because of his status (which is most certainly the case with most men in his position), and the mainstream goes wild.

But Hillary Clinton can lie before Congress, do nothing while four men are fighting for their lives in Libya, silence her husband’s accusers, and they still protect her?!?

You bet your rear-end Trump is right when he says this election is rigged. (And that’s not even taking into account all the fraud that will take place at the polls.) Then there’s the whole email fiasco.

What a joke.


No matter what Hillary does, she’ll get a free pass. But if Trump commits even the smallest infraction (not to say the video was small), he’s berated like a red-headed stepchild.

Drake is claiming that Trump offered her $10,000 to stay with him in his hotel.

So…what’s the issue here?

She gets paid to do that sort of thing, right? Would this even be an issue if Trump filmed the encounter? Oh, Dems are trying to do everything they can to paint Trump as a misogynist?

Got it. I’m not saying Trump made the offer or not, but you’re telling me a billionaire – or any heterosexual man with money – wouldn’t proposition a porn star if given the chance?

HA! I scoff at thee who thinketh otherwise!

Bottom line is that this woman is siding with Hillary Clinton to keep Trump out of office after he offered her 100 Benjamin’ to do what she does on a daily basis.

Here are 15 specific proposals Trump will look to accomplish within his first 100 days as president.

In fact, the businessman plans to get a number of these things done on day one.

Take a look…

From Breitbart:

Here is the list of the “Contract with the American Voter” policies detailed by Trump: -Propose a Constitutional Amendment to impose term limits on all members of Congress

-Institute a hiring freeze on all federal employees to reduce federal workforce through attrition (exempting military, public safety, and public health) -Require for every new federal regulation, two existing regulations must be eliminated.

-Institute a five year-ban on White House and Congressional officials becoming lobbyists after they leave government service -Create a lifetime ban on White House officials lobbying on behalf of a foreign government.

-Institute a complete ban on foreign lobbyists raising money for American elections.

-Announce intention to renegotiate NAFTA or withdraw from the deal under Article 2205.

-Announce withdrawal from the Trans-Pacific Partnership.

-Direct Secretary of the Treasury to label China a currency manipulator.

-Direct the Secretary of Commerce and U.S. Trade Representative to identify all foreign trading abuses that unfairly impact American workers and direct them to use every tool under American and international law to end those abuses immediately.

-Lift the restrictions on the production of $50 trillion dollars’ worth of job-producing American energy reserves, including shale, oil, natural gas and clean coal.

-Lift the Obama-Clinton roadblocks and allow vital energy infrastructure projects, like the Keystone Pipeline, to move forward.

-Cancel billions in payments to U.N. climate change programs and use the money to fix America’s water and environmental infrastructure.

-Cancel every unconstitutional executive action, memorandum and order issued by President Obama.

-Begin the process of selecting a replacement for Justice Scalia from one of the 20 judges on my list, who will uphold and defend the Constitution of the United States.

Other things Trump is promising the American people include: canceling federal funding to sanctuary cities, and working with Congress on school choice.

Let’s get ‘er done!"
100825,1008,Why Should Trump Accept the Election Results?,http://www.americanthinker.com/articles/2016/10/why_emshouldem_trump_accept_the_election_results.html,30,"The headline on the October 20 edition of the Washington Post blared, ""Trump won't vow to honor results,"" referring to the election that the Post devoutly hopes will go to his opponent, the corrupt and criminal Hillary Clinton.  The Post's exaggerated headline is only symptomatic of the hyperventilating on both sides of the aisle over Trump's refusal to commit to personally accepting a negative election result.  The fact is, Trump's position is both quite logical and constitutionally inconsequential. 

Most obviously, Trump believes, with some good reason, that the election process as a whole is ""rigged"" against him (and by extension any Republican candidate).  In light of Trump's having stated that position, and supported it at least in part, it actually is rather absurd to expect him to have answered Chris Wallace's question during the debate other than how he did.  Would it have been better for Trump to have said something like ""Well, sure, Chris – even though I believe that Hillary belongs in jail, the Democrats are engaged in voting fraud, and the mainstream media has abandoned any hint of objectivity in order to see an utterly corrupt candidate elected, I'll accept the results of the election, no matter how egregious, unethical, immoral, unfair and criminal they may be""?  That would have been an illogical statement.

Politically, perhaps, it would have been advisable – a debatable point, given Trump's appeal as someone who tells it like it is – for Trump to have simply said, ""Yes, I'll accept the result.""  That he did not was not only rational, but ethical. 

Trump is not delusional, though the Democrats and the mainstream media do all they can to make it seem that way.  Trump says the election is ""rigged,"" and that is a not unreasonable position.  It cannot by any objective standard be conclusively refuted. 

What does ""rigged"" mean?  Does it mean active voter fraud operations?  Yes.  Those are relatively rare, but they do occur, and there is proof that voter fraud is occurring right now.  The scale is unknown, but to say as the left is wont to do that Trump's allegations are myth is absolutely mendacious.

But rigged in common terms also means much more.  If the reporters and editors of the mass media, who tout themselves as objective journalists, in fact are in the tank for Hillary Clinton and use their power overwhelmingly to help the Democrat and hurt the Republican, isn't this also fairly described as rigging an election?  When they call voter fraud a myth, when it is not (its scope and frequency reasonably disputable but not its existence), is that not attempting to rig an election? 

If the government-controlled media of an autocratic state promotes only the favored candidate in a sham election, these very same ""journalists"" would have no trouble identifying it as election-rigging. When they do the same thing, not only out of ideological conviction in support of the government, but also for the perks and opportunities that the revolving door of government offers, they are not in any meaningful way different.  So why is that not rigging an election?

Similarly, in a corrupt autocratic nation where the leaders milk the country dry for their own benefit but keep themselves out of jail though fraudulent influence-peddling, again, these same journalists would have no problem labeling that as election-rigging.  How are Hillary's machinations and the FBI's and Justice Department's refusal to prosecute clear criminal activity (that anyone else would have been long ago indicted for, if not already jailed) at all different?

Arguably the greatest moment in American political history occurred on March 4, 1797, when George Washington stepped down as president of the United States and, pursuant to the Constitution, handed power over to his elected successor, John Adams.  Plenty of skeptics here and abroad could not conceive that such a thing would actually happen, that a man with immense prestige and power would voluntarily give it up on the basis of following some novel laws based on newly fashioned republican principles.  But he did, and so, really, in that moment was the American republic if not figuratively born, then slapped and given its first real breath.  We will not face a similar situation on November 8. 

Nonetheless, the idea now bruited across the chattering classes, from the Democrat side and not a few Republicans, is that Trump's debate statement was an affront to our constitutional system.  Hillary Clinton shrilly called it ""horrifying"" and ""talking down our democracy.""  This would be laughable if its basic silliness were not automatically accepted by a large portion of a know-nothing electorate that actually listens to such drivel. 

Who cares whether Trump accepts the results or not?  What's he going to do?  Call out the 82nd Airborne to seize Washington and arrest Obama and Hillary?  Unlike George Washington or any sitting president, he has no position in government, no real or apparent legal authority, or any of the coercive power of the state.  He is a private citizen and will still be one on November 8 if he loses.  He can say what he likes.

Will he call out his minions to riot in the streets like the Democrats of Ferguson or Baltimore?  Will President Obama and President-Elect Hillary give Trump's angry supporters some room to riot like the Democrat mayor of Baltimore?  They won't have to, because riots are not going to happen. 

But Trump's die-hard supporters, and many other Americans who like the man much less, will be justifiably incensed by the fact that regardless of whether the Democrats engage in active meaningful vote fraud, a sitting president, in contravention of everything George Washington stood for, ignored the law and the Constitution to secure his own designated successor despite her blatant corruption and criminality.  He did this by abusing his executive power to absolve Hillary of criminal wrongdoing through the misuse and dishonest exploitation of the Justice Department and the FBI.  The truly horrifying talking down of democracy was James Comey's July 5 statement that established a double standard of justice in this country – one for Hillary Clinton, President Obama's chosen successor, and another for everyone else. 

If that is not rigging an election, I don't know what is.  And there is no reason for Trump or any other citizen to ""accept"" a result in November that puts Obama's corrupt and criminal successor in power.

100826,1008,Why Hispanics Shouldn’t Vote for Hillary,http://www.americanthinker.com/articles/2016/10/why_hispanics_shouldnt_vote_for_hillary_.html,30,"While polls show that more Hispanics prefer Hillary over Trump to occupy the White House those Hispanics need to take a close look at what Hillary’s party has done for -- and more importantly, to -- Hispanics in the U.S.

The Hispanic population has grown so rapidly that it is difficult to believe that the 1970 Census questionnaire did not include a racial or ethnic category called “Hispanic.” But this was not because Hispanics did not live in the U.S. in significant numbers. The musical West Side Story from the 1950s featured several Puerto Rican main characters, and cities like New York and Chicago had relatively large Puerto Rican populations, numbering in the hundreds of thousands.

After 1950, with the passage of the Federal Highway Act Americans began to move out of big cities and into suburbs. They were looking for green lawns, cleaner air, and bigger homes. As they moved away from cities, however, city populations began to decline and are still declining. To counteract this decline President Lyndon B. Johnson started the Great Society package of Federal programs. While on paper and in speeches these programs were allegedly designed to lift people out of poverty, the result was to isolate black and later Hispanic persons into highly segregated neighborhoods. While these programs proclaimed to help the disadvantaged and poor, the result was more disadvantaged and more poor.

Chicago, for example, doubled the proportion of its residents who lived in segregated low-income housing from ten to twenty percent from 1960 to 1970. These Federal programs rewarded single mothers with children, leading to a great increase in the number of fatherless children. The school systems of these big cities were all controlled by the huge public sector teacher unions of the Democrat Party. They did a terrible job of educating children to obtain good paying jobs, effectively guaranteeing that these children would never leave poverty.

But as city populations continued to decline, the city fathers of the north needed still more residents. And the way to finance this population increase was to utilize federal program dollars earmarked for poverty. In 1965 Senator Kennedy modified the immigration laws to allow relatives of people in the U.S. to move to the cities. But this still wasn’t enough; the numbers who entered the declining cities of the Midwest and Northeast still failed to keep the populations of these cities stable.

The strategy that was then adopted was illegal immigration: to allow people to illegally bypass the rules of legal immigration. Two general types of illegal immigrants were created: those who overstayed visas obtained legally, and those who entered via the southern border. The model used to provide for these new residents became a duplicate of the model used to create black ghettoes: highly segregated neighborhoods with residents supplied by Federal, local county, and state welfare programs. To justify this scheme Democrats said the nation needed illegal immigrants to do “low paid jobs no one else will do” such as picking lettuce and tomatoes. Never mind the fact that New York City and Chicago don’t have any farm fields.

So the illegal immigrants were supported by government benefits to do whatever work they could do. And in cities such as Los Angeles, New York, and Chicago sanctuary policies were enacted which paved the way for them to work.

This all happened so quickly that no one thought about the immigrants themselves: how they could learn to read, write, and speak a new language. And whether their new lifestyle in the north would provide good lives for them and their families.

It is not only accurate but entirely fair to portray illegal immigration as created by the government and promoted by the Democrat Party. After all, it is Democrats who control all the sanctuary cities of the north and the public-sector union jobs.

But Hispanics are beginning to see that there’s a price to pay to be wards of the Democrat Party, that their socioeconomic situation has become more like that of blacks and less like what they had hoped.

Hispanics should look at blacks under Democrat Party control and wonder if their fate will be the same or worse. Blacks today, under the first black president, are living in greater poverty than before the Obama presidency. Their food stamp use has increased and employment rate declined. Looking to Obama for inspiration and an improvement in their lives, blacks realize all he has inspired them to do is blame white society for the poverty and racism he has, to some extent, increased. Their families are in greater poverty and their prospects are grimmer.

Blacks tell the story: fifty years of big city social programs has hardly improved the lot of any of them. Those who have lifted themselves up out of poverty and out of the ghetto have only done so through herculean individual effort. They have received little help from Democrats.

And now Hispanics, having been placed in big sanctuary cities under the same Democrat model of community development, are facing the same situation. The Pew Hispanic Center Study Between Two Worlds reported in 2009: “Young Hispanic females have the highest rates of teen parenthood of any major racial or ethnic group in the country.” And that “about one in four Hispanic females (26%) becomes a mother by age 19. This compares with a rate of 22% among young black females, 11% among young white females.”

There is a high correlation between single motherhood, poverty and poor education. “The high school dropout rate among Latino youths (17%) is nearly three times as high as it is among white youths (6%) and nearly double the rate among blacks (9%). These figures are for the entire nation, not just sanctuary cities. And more than half Mexican-heritage young Latinos had experience with gangs (56%) than Latinos of other Hispanic national origins.

These discouraging facts go on and on. The movement of people of color, first from Africa and then Mexico, have some very interesting similarities. Both were initially brought into the U.S. to work in agriculture. Both ended up being encouraged to migrate north, with their living expenses subsidized by taxpayers. Both ended up with similarly tragic socioeconomic issues.

At some point Hispanics may start thinking about what’s best for their families, not just what’s best for Democrats running for election. And whether it’s a good idea to trust Democrats to make a better life for them in big city barrios. Blacks have trusted them for over eighty years, and are now starting to evaluate how it’s worked out for them. Black leaders are still complaining about how bad things are in their communities.

At some point Hispanics may wonder, if they continue to vote for Democrats, if their neighborhoods will get any better, when they never got any better for blacks. Hispanics may wish to think about whether fifty years from now they will still be complaining about bad schools, gangs, poverty, and low-paying jobs. Hispanics should already know what Democrats have planned for them.

100827,1008,Five Things We Must Do to Preserve Our Nation,http://www.americanthinker.com/articles/2016/10/five_things_we_must_do_to_preserve_our_nation.html,30,"Below, you will see two charts that I downloaded.  I am led to conclude that we have serious problems with both parties.  Our legislators know the inevitable trajectory of rampant spending, and choose to continue to demand more money and power.  As we endure their disingenuous rhetoric, they rob us of a stable future.  Please take a quick look at them.

The charts name the parties of the presidents in the time frame, but not the senators and congressmen who actually make the laws and pass the budgets.  These men and women have no term limits, and thereby no limit to the damage they can do.  There is also no limit to the benefits they can vote for themselves.  And they keep lobbyists in their tents, and when you throw the presidential ego into the mix, you redefine the word “party.”

My conclusions:

First, you should vote for Donald Trump.  Why?  Because he is not one of them, and you can easily see by their reactions to him that the senate and house are terrified that he will win and upset the game.  A reduction in corruption must start at the top in order to prevent true chaos.  This might prevent revolution from the bottom up – a much worse scenario.  Can Donald Trump do this?  We do not know, but he is the only one in this election cycle who even pretends to recognize the economic facts and promotes term limits.  He deserves credit, and votes, for that alone.

Second, perhaps rethink your politics, and determine if you wish to stay where you have always been.  What we, as voters, have been doing is not working anymore either.  Some see a “stasis” in a vote for Hillary.  You can look again at the charts and know that “things staying the same” is not an option.  Traditional Democrats, and Republicans have knee-jerk reactions to elections.  But both parties have been hijacked by their extremes.  I did not expect to support Trump, but now I do.

Democrats have become the party of the extreme left and are openly pushing for socialism, huge government, and a rewrite of the Constitution.  They pander to the poor and promise them money they don’t have. They openly rail against the rich, even when they are rich, or need money from the rich (i.e. Hillary Clinton) and they promote a caste system that includes governmentally sustained poverty and hopelessness for the disadvantaged.  They pay better than working wages to teenage girls if they get pregnant, and offer the young men involved a total pass on responsibility.  They now openly invite invasion of foreigners, promising to give them money and benefits, even as they know we cannot pay for it.

The Republicans have morphed into the party of protection for the ever-growing federal government and long careers in Washington DC.  Supposedly, they are all white, and racially prejudiced.  You notice they did not prevent Obamacare, thereby benefitting the pharmaceutical and insurance industries in a huge way.  They pretend to abhor Obama, but have given him nearly everything he wants in a fake game of not cooperating.  Obama simply dictates from his podium and they acquiesce.

Do you see how these two extremes are actually symbiotic?  The Dems keep importing cheap labor for votes, (this benefits big business), and the Reps keep exporting production, which decimates the pricey middle class.   Together they are a dream team of corruption.

Third, we must install term limits at all levels of government!  If we do not make a whole-hearted change soon, in the way we allow ourselves to be governed, the freedoms earned by our ancestors, that are globally desired and emulated, will be lost.  And if trends continue, we should know that socialism, in practice, has proven that mandated economic equality sets in motion a “devolution” as people inevitably follow the path of least resistance when there is no reward for effort.

Fourth, we must as individuals summon our courage.  Nothing I am proposing will go smoothly and without sacrifice.  There are tens of trillions of dollars at stake (and we are still printing money 24/7).  Those in power will not give that up easily.  I do not propose that the newly elected could fix us immediately.  I simply propose that those elected, in their time allotted, should go back to the drawing board, and come up with a plan to stabilize and reverse the trend, and to honor the pledge to uphold the US Constitution.  And when they term out, the next set can follow suit.

The fifth, and hardest thing of all is personal: drop all prejudices that you know are just that.  I do not suggest you would forget your opinions and experiences, I am saying the Golden Rule is the only functional principle to live by.  We simply must treat our fellow citizens as we would treat ourselves.  We will need to move “racial equality” and “help for the poor” back into our own personal realm of responsibility.  If we allow the government to rule charity and kindness, religion, parenting, education and social engineering, we abdicate our own obligations - and we continue to pay people to be and to stay poor.  We have officially proven that strategy does not work and we have victimized whole generations in the process.

It is with great respect and grief for the 2,996 lost on 9/11, and those lost since to terrorism, that I offer this:  These losses should not be an incentive to forfeit our Constitution, our freedoms, our individual liberties, and the control of our own nation and political parties.  I believe we must let politicians know, with this election, that we are done with business as usual in Washington DC.  No more Big Brother (Homeland Defense, NSA and crooked IRS).  We are not terrorized!

100828,1009,TRUMP’S GETTYSBURG ADDRESS? HE’S OFF-MESSAGE!,http://www.powerlineblog.com/archives/2016/10/trumps-gettysburg-address-hes-off-message.php,30,"When the focus is on issues, Donald Trump wins. When the focus is on collateral nonsense, Hillary Clinton wins. So our liberal media have desperately tried to deflect attention away from the vital issues that separate the parties and the candidates, and toward a succession of critiques of Donald Trump’s personality.

Sometimes Trump has enabled this, as with his four-day feud with the Khan family. But it no longer matters. The liberal press has the playbook down, regardless of what Trump actually does.

Today Trump went to Gettysburg, Pennsylvania and delivered a major, substantive speech, outlining what he proposes to do in the first 100 days of his administration. This is the kind of thing that must be kept secret–marked with a “c” perhaps–lest voters be reminded that they actually agree with the reviled Republican nominee. Let’s not take any chances!

How did the liberal press suppress information about Trump’s proposals? They buried the lede. This is how the Associated Press reported on Trump’s effort to shift the focus to the issues: So the news is that Trump is “off message.” He talked about the women who, he says, have falsely accused him. Everything else can wait. That screen shot was from the Associated Press’s web site. An AP article like this one will be picked up by hundreds of newspapers. In almost all cases, those papers are run by liberals too, so they are happy to echo the AP’s theme. My home town paper, the Minneapolis Star Tribune, duplicated the AP’s headline: Did Donald Trump say anything else at Gettysburg today? The highly-motivated reader might find out that he did. The average voter will think that the entire campaign turns on Trump’s alleged sexual peccadilloes. The less said about issues the better, if you are a Democrat."
100829,1009,SATURDAY AFTERNOON COMING DOWN,http://www.powerlineblog.com/archives/2016/10/saturday-afternoon-coming-down.php,30,"Scott was very kind this morning to draw attention to my Weekly Standard article “Crisis of the Conservative House Divided.” I would have done so myself, but I was on the road all day yesterday on a completely frivolous and speculative venture: I drove up to Modesto, the location where American Graffiti was filmed set, to meet up with my two best pals from high school (we call ourselves “The Executive Committee”) to take in Ian Anderson presenting a sort-of reconstituted Jethro Tull. Because I’m too old to rock and roll but too young to die. And also “Living in the Past,” which they played! And yes, Ian Anderson still strikes his stork pose of playing his flute on one leg, at age 69. It was a little shocking, though I suppose predictable, that I was among the youngest in the crowd. I guess 70s prog rock hasn’t become a hipster thing. (Which is fine with me.) If I hadn’t been so busy last week I might have thought to try to organize a Power Line meetup for central valley readers. Maybe next time: the Gallo Performing Arts Center is a nice facility. I’d go there again.

Meanwhile, I’ll add just one thought, for now, to my article. I mentioned that our official political culture now constricts what opinions can be considered legitimate, and in dong so essentially says that conservatives (and by extension the Republican Party) are illegitimate unless we simply change our mind and join the liberals.

Our monotone media is one major cog in the opinion conformity machine. This is not a new observation by any means, and it was perhaps best expressed in Winston Churchill’s 1931 essay “Mass Effects in Modern Life.” Here’s the relevant passage:

Public opinion is formed and expressed by machinery. The newspapers do an immense amount of thinking for the average man and woman. In fact they supply them with such a continuous stream of standardized opinion, borne along upon an equally inexhaustible flood of news and sensation, collected from every part of the world every hour of the day, that there is neither the need nor the leisure for personal reflection. All this is but a part of a tremendous educating process. But it is an education which passes in one ear and out at the other. It is an education at once universal and superficial. It produces enormous numbers of standardized citizens, all equipped with regulation opinions, prejudices and sentiments, according to their class or party. It may eventually lead to a reasonable, urbane, and highly-serviceable society.

There you have it, Saturday readers. Jethro Tull and Churchill. In one post. It’s what we do here.

(By the way, very much worth reading the entire Churchill essay at the link above. And buying the collection in which it appears, Thoughts and Adventures, now back in print courtesy of ISI Books.)"
100830,1009,WHAT IS TO BE DONE?,http://www.powerlineblog.com/archives/2016/10/what-is-to-be-done-6.php,30,"Steve Hayward’s current Weekly Standard article “Crisis of the conservative house divided” provides an anatomy of splits in the conservative movement exposed in the course of the 2016 presidential contest. It’s an important and illuminating essay.

Steve’s essay turns on “the insidious political character of the ‘administrative state,’ a phrase once confined chiefly to the ranks of conservative political scientists, but which has broken out into common parlance. It refers not simply to large bureaucracy, but to the way in which the constitutional separation of powers has been steadily eroded by the delegation of more and more lawmaking to a virtual ‘fourth branch’ of government.”

Regardless of who wins the election, the vast apparatus of regulatory agencies will continue to dictate much of the way we live now. Steve elaborates on the political effects of this new regime and the difficulty of mounting resistance to it. A left-wing president deploys the new regime to his own purposes. A conservative president would be subservient to it. Congress and the courts have abdicated their responsibilities.

What is to be done? Steve’s essay is perfect weekend reading and one of the most important pieces I have read this season."
100831,1010,Emmett Till memorial in Mississippi is now pierced by bullet holes,https://thinkprogress.org/emmett-till-memorial-bullets-858edf62afdb#.udv8vcj9e,30,"The memorial marking the place where 14-year-old Emmett Till’s body was found is now covered in bullet holes.
Till was kidnapped and brutally murdered in 1955 after allegedly whistling at a white woman. His body was thrown in the Tallahatchie River. The two white men responsible for his death were found “not guilty” by an all-white jury. Till’s death was a major moment in the civil rights movement, and his casket is now on display in the National Museum of African American History and Culture.
The sign marking the spot where Till’s body was removed from the river in Tallahatchie County, Mississippi, now has over 50 bullet holes in it, according to WJTV, a local CNN affiliate.
Kevin Wilson Jr., who is working on a film short about Till, posted a picture of the sign on Facebook after finding it while looking for places to film. It has since been shared over 12,000 times.
The Emmett Till Interpretive Center in Sumner, Mississippi, has almost reached its fundraising goal to replace the bullet-ridden sign.
“I was very emotional. I did not expect to see the site, the marker, with bullet holes in it,” Wilson told WJTV. “That marker was just evidence that there are people who are still living in those areas who still hold those ideologies dear to their heart. Ideologies that we’re trying to get away from.”
A recent study from the Southern Poverty Law Center (SPLC) found that in 2015, the number of hate groups in the United States increased for the first time in three years_—_and was 14 percent higher than the year before. “2015 was a year that very nearly approaches the political upheavals of 1968,” Mark Potok, SPLC senior fellow who worked on the report, told ThinkProgress shortly after it was released. “An enormous amount of hatred has been absorbed in the political mainstream.”
Potok pointed to hateful rhetoric from the Republican presidential nominee as one explanation. Republican nominee Donald Trump’s campaign has been marked by white supremacy, and he has repeatedly criticized the Black community. He has encouraged racism against Black protesters at his rallies and Black Lives Matters activists, and he has shared a fake photo of Black supporters. Last November, he retweeted an image that showed that the number of “blacks killed by police” is far lower than the number of “blacks killed by blacks.”"
100832,1010,Trump threatens to sue all the women who accused him of sexual assault,https://thinkprogress.org/trump-sue-women-sexual-assault-d75a73342209,30,"Republican nominee Donald Trump gave a speech in Gettysburg, Pennsylvania on Saturday on what the first 100 days of his presidency would look like. He didn’t reveal a lot of new policy ideas, but say this: Trump will sue all of the women who said they were sexually assaulted by him.
“Every woman who lied when they came forward to hurt my campaign, total fabrication,” he said near the beginning of his speech. “The events never happened, never. All of these liars will be sued after the election is over.”
His announcement was met with cheers from the audience. Trump criticized the media for “virtually no fact-checking” of the women’s accounts.
Thus far, 11 women have come forward to say they were sexually assaulted by the Republican nominee. Despite promising to deliver evidence that would dispute the accounts, Trump has come up with little in his defense. A British man, Anthony Gilberthorpe, claims to have been in the same first class cabin as Jessica Leeds when Trump allegedly Leeds in 1980. Gilberthrope says he was “present at all times” during the flight and that Leeds’ version of events is false. He has repeatedly lied to the media about other things in the past.
Meanwhile, six people have corroborated the account of Natasha Stoynoff, a former People magazine writer who said last week that she was attacked by Trump while trying to interview him and his wife for a reporting assignment.
Trump also spent some time in his speech comparing himself to former president Abraham Lincoln; he then spoke about the need to deport undocumented immigrants, repeal Obamacare, conduct extreme vetting for immigrants from regions that are “terror-prone” (he didn’t clarify which countries), approve the Keystone Pipeline, and build a wall between Mexico and the United States_—_one that the United States would pay for and Mexico would then “reimburse.” One of the only new ideas he presented was offering vocational training for students_—_because while some students may not be good at history or physics, they could be able to “build a wall.”
Trump also repeatedly stated that the election was rigged, as he has been doing in recent weeks."
